  - inner beauty's easy to see when you're iooking for it.

  - the brain sees what the heart wants it to feel.

- que:
  - don't you think you're brainwashed?
  ans:

  - ooh.

- que:
  - that might work.
  ans:
  - what haven't we tried yet?

- que:
  - how many more empty nests will it take?
  ans:
  - perhaps it wouldn't be empty if she'd spent more time layin 'and less time escapin '.

- que:
  - so laying eggs all your life... and then getting plucked, stuffed and roasted is good enough for you?
  ans:
  - it's a livin '.

- que:
  - you know what the problem is?
  ans:
  - the fences aren't just round the farm.

  ans:
  - ah, this way.

- que:
  - which part of \" they kill us \" do you not understand?
  ans:
  - i got my own set of problems to worry about.

- que:
  - all of you?
  ans:
  - that's what i've been trying to tell you.

- que:
  - you want to get every chicken in this place out of here at the same time?
  ans:
  - i'm trying to lay low here.

- que:
  - would you?
  ans:
  - give me one reason why i shouldn't.

- que:
  - do you know what'il happen if he finds me?
  ans:
  - it's a cruel world.

- que:
  - with this wing?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - the name is ginger.
  ans:
  - and if i don't?

- que:

- que:
  - your wing's on my side of the bunk.
  ans:

  ans:
  - and that bunty.

- que:
  - have we flown over that fence?
  ans:
  - to learn how to fly.

  ans:

- que:
  - you know anything about owen taylor?
  ans:
  - only that a few sternwood chauffeurs...... lost their jobs on account of the younger daughter, carmen.

- que:
  - carmen?
  ans:
  - this doesn't look like the way you'd handle it.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i didn't do this.

- que:
  - what were you going to say, phil?
  ans:
  - give me another day, bernie.

- que:

- que:
  - you still can't tell me what my father wants you to do?
  ans:
  - not without his permission.

- que:
  - you can't even tell me if it was about carmen?
  ans:
  - you better look at this.

- que:
  - the demand came how?
  ans:
  - a woman telephoned me after it was delivered.

- que:
  - there has to be something else?
  ans:
  - this thing isn't worth $5000 to anybody.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - she said if they didn't get the money today...... i'd be talking to my sister through a wire screen.

- que:
  - what kind of a jam?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you know where this picture was taken?
  ans:
  - i haven't the slightest idea.

  - what was owen doing with your car last night?
  ans:
  - nobody knows.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you think...

- que:
  - that he knew about this picture?
  ans:
  - i don't rule him out.

- que:
  - outside of what the woman said...... you don't know why they want $5000 for it?
  ans:
  - that's why i came to you.

- que:
  - why didn't you go to the police?
  ans:
  - you were afraid they'd find something i couldn't sit on.

- que:
  - may i use your phone, mr. marlowe?
  ans:
  - police headquarters, please.

- que:
  - the police?
  ans:
  - my father should hear this.

- que:
  - who is this?
  ans:
  - yeah, but she just told you that...

- que:
  - i hope the sergeant never traces that call.
  ans:
  - what can i do for you?

- que:
  - why did you stop me phoning?
  ans:
  - because i'm working for your father.

- que:
  - can you get it?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - where from, your father?
  ans:
  - i'd rather not.

- que:
  - where would you get it?
  ans:
  - well, from eddie mars.

- que:
  - the gambler?
  ans:
  - that explains why you haven't got $5000 in cash.

- que:
  - how do you know he'il give it to you?
  ans:
  - i can get the money.

- que:
  - that doesn't interest you?
  ans:

- que:
  - is regan mixed up in this?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - tell you what?
  ans:
  - what you're trying to find out.

- que:

  ans:
  - yes, joe did it.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:

- que:
  - you ready to go?
  ans:
  - okay, so you had a close encounter with something.

  - don't i owe it to myself...... to try and find her?
  ans:
  - you're hunting sasquatch.

  - not really.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - to survive that battle, and those wounds...

- que:

  ans:
  - to count them would be in very bad taste.

  ans:
  - you look like a man to me.

- que:
  - you have a duty to accept my challenge.

- que:
  - why do i have a duty to fight the man who saved my life?
  ans:
  - you are no longer who you were when you came.

- que:

- que:
  - how many times do i have to tell you?
  ans:
  - thats something mortals do from excessive self respect...... and stupid pride.

- que:
  - why would i do that?
  ans:
  - shabby politicians start wars where you kill each other by the thousand.

- que:
  - isnt that absurd?
  ans:
  - listen...... the existence of this world is absurd.

- que:
  - all right, then.... why did you kill him and choose me?
  ans:
  - you were both half dead.

- que:
  - but why me and not him?
  ans:
  - no reason.

- que:
  - would you rather youd died and been eaten instead?
  ans:
  - and look, i didnt kill him.

- que:
  - not all the ones i killed were people.
  ans:
  - what chance have i got?

- que:
  - wherd he go?
  ans:
  - sometimes demons or goblins look like people.

- que:
  - demons, goblins, aragami... what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - as i told you, the world isnt always what it seems.

- que:
  - who, me?

  ans:
  - yeah, something like that.

- que:
  - and you want me to fight a monster like you?
  ans:
  - thats right.

- que:
  - how will a bears claw help?
  ans:
  - ninja stars are for losers.

- que:
  - tell me...... have you ever dreamed?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:

  ans:
  - so you mean to win...

- que:
  - if were the same kind, and youre aragami...... what does that make me?
  ans:
  - beat me and youil find out.

- que:
  - cant you do better than that?
  ans:
  - the hammer...

- que:
  - is there no one in this world who can stand against me?
  ans:

  - i work for a man named donnagon.

- que:
  - who is this guy?
  ans:
  - donnagon's not interested in your creatures.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:

- que:
  - what are you babbling about now, juni?
  ans:
  - the transmooker you took from the president's daughter, gary.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - he has his reasons.

  - well, i don't believe in that do you?

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - the other side of the island.

- que:
  - with those monsters running around?
  ans:
  - i don't believe they're monsters.

- que:
  - well, what should i believe?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - be with me?
  ans:
  - they wanna be picking me out of their teeth, is what they wanna be.

- que:
  - you're not afraid?
  ans:
  - first thing you gotta do is...... fall into this pit.

- que:
  - how does it work?
  ans:
  - supposedly, they're run magnetically.

- que:
  - okay.
  ans:
  - why?

- que:
  - you're sure you're reading that map correctly?
  ans:
  - the coordinates correspond to carmen and juni's current position.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - aah.

- que:
  - aah.
  ans:
  - and why are we doing this?

- que:
  - when we get lost, who saves us?
  ans:
  - mom and dad.

- que:
  - now, if mom and dad also disappear, who's gonna stop donnagon from using the transmooker device?
  ans:
  - donnagon wants us all together so he can destroy the island and all of us with it.

- que:
  - what did what did you just do?
  ans:
  - we lost carmen.

- que:
  - a and juni?
  ans:

  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - is it something you can tell me?
  ans:
  - no, it's personal. there's nothing you could say that i wouldn't understand.

- que:
  - why don't you just try me?
  ans:
  - i sold my soul to the devil for seven wishes.

  - who are you?
  ans:
  - just a friend, brother.

- que:
  - pathetic, aren't they?
  ans:
  - everybody wants to go to the party, but nobody wants to pay the piper.

  - are you?
  ans:
  - don't get too excited.

- que:
  - anyway, darling, have you thought of your last wish?
  ans:
  - i hate to rush you, but there's a time limit.

- que:
  - do you think this halo's too much?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do you mean, you don't want it?
  ans:
  - you get seven wishes. there's nothing i want.

- que:
  - what is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - well, last night, when i was lying in jail, i was talking to this guy...... and i realized that wishing just doesn't work.

- que:
  - so it's okay?
  ans:
  - well, no, elliot.

- que:

- que:
  - now, will you get off my screen?
  ans:
  - i have work to do.

- que:
  - what's this whole \" get thee behind me \" thing?
  ans:
  - we still have business here, mr. richards.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - that wasn't a wish.

- que:
  - what do you call it?
  ans:
  - i don't recall anybody ever accusing me of being fair before.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no, this isn't right.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - uh, not really.

- que:
  - is it something you could tell me?
  ans:
  - okay, a few days ago i sold my soul to the devil for seven wishes.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - this is so unnecessary.

- que:
  - so, do you have a copy of this contract?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - at this nightclub in oakland?
  ans:
  - yes, at a nightclub, and no i can't tell you where it is.

- que:
  - so, you either book me or you let me go.
  ans:
  - because you promised the devil you wouldn't?

- que:
  - oh, what do i do, what do i do?
  ans:
  - i choose \" book you.

- que:
  - she's the devil, that one.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i said, she's the devil, that lady cop.

- que:
  - so, what you in for, brother?
  ans:
  - eternity.

- que:
  - why do you say that?
  ans:
  - doesn't really belong to you in the first place.

- que:
  - so, who does it belong to?
  ans:
  - it belongs to god, that universal spirit that animates and binds all things in existence.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - just a friend, brother.

- que:
  - pathetic, aren't they?
  ans:
  - everybody wants to go to the party, but nobody wants to pay the piper.

- que:
  - anyway, elliot, my darling, have you thought of your last wish?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you think this halo's too much?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do you mean, you don't want it?
  ans:
  - you get seven wishes.

- que:
  - do you know, that is so inspiring.
  ans:
  - what is that supposed to mean?

- que:
  - so, it's okay?
  ans:
  - well, no, elliot.

- que:
  - so, let's just get on with it, shall we?
  ans:
  - i'm not gonna do it.

- que:
  - oh, god.
  ans:
  - oh, really?

- que:
  - heaven?
  ans:
  - god, no, it's the courthouse.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nobody ever reads the contract.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - basically, it says... ifyou commit one truly benevolent act, it voids the contract.

- que:
  - so i get to keep my soul?
  ans:
  - yes, you get to keep your soul.

- que:
  - you're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
  ans:
  - no, no, i promise.

- que:
  - i mean, why are you... being nice?
  ans:
  - look, elliot, i'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

- que:
  - so, i can go now?
  ans:
  - unless you want another seven wishes.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - i'm great.

- que:
  - what's up, dudester?

  - how'd it go?
  ans:
  - you said...

- que:
  - okay?

  ans:
  - well, there was a beginning, a middle, and an end.

- que:
  - but on the other hand, should that be your problem?
  ans:
  - so life's kind of hard all around.

- que:
  - so what would a guy like that say?
  ans:
  - he'd say, \" my name is alex hitchens and i'm a consultant.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - he'd be interested.

- que:
  - don't you hate it when that happens?
  ans:

- que:
  - hasn't it?
  ans:
  - you don't know me very well.

- que:
  - are you saying my virtue is not intact?
  ans:
  - you know it is.

- que:

- que:
  - what are you all talking about?
  ans:
  - the notorious phantom.

- que:
  - well, who has the most fabulous diamond in the world?
  ans:
  - i suppose i do.

- que:
  - why should you?
  ans:
  - when the present government seized power... they claimed the diamond was the property of the people.

- que:
  - why don't i steal the diamond and leave that old glove behind?

  - you and i could split the insurance.

- que:
  - your highness?
  ans:
  - i'd love to.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - what do you think, george?
  ans:
  - well, i think maybe i was wrong.

- que:
  - can't it wait?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid not.

- que:
  - the phantom?
  ans:
  - yes, you must come at once.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i am a husband that must be envied by all other husbands.

- que:
  - do you want to call it off?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  - who is it?
  ans:
  - bellboy.

- que:
  - what is it?

- que:
  - what kind of hospitality is that?
  ans:
  - but, listen, my husband could be back any minute.

- que:
  - perhaps the phantom is hiding under the bed?
  ans:
  - that's more like it.

- que:
  - suppose jacques doesn't go to brunico?
  ans:
  - not a chance.

  ans:
  - and afterwards, we have our lovely, warm bed.

- que:

- que:
  - what does this have to do with the tape?
  ans:
  - take my picture.

- que:
  - this the same camera?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so, what do you think?
  ans:

  - no, not really.

- que:
  - would you say that i'm gullible?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - easily rattled?
  ans:
  - definitely not.

- que:
  - where'd it come from?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - yeah, why?
  ans:
  - the numbers are all screwed up.

- que:
  - i mean, that's like being born without fingerprints.
  ans:
  - hey, noah, can you pretend for one minute that i don't read video geek magazine?

- que:
  - then, how did this get recorded?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - it looks like she's walking away whoever she is.

  ans:
  - i got to go.

  ans:
  - i don't want her to see it.

- que:
  - what about me seeing it?
  ans:
  - you had no problem showing it to me.

- que:
  - what are you then?
  ans:
  - in a hurry.

- que:
  - then i storm out all pissed off, kicking myself for ever thinking that you could just... grow up.
  ans:
  - what are you thinking?

- que:
  - so, why don't we just cut to that part right now and save ourselves a lot of grief?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - becca?
  ans:
  - becca.

- que:
  - she was afraid, wasn't she?
  ans:
  - something was happening to her.

- que:
  - becca... how did she die?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - who will show me?
  ans:
  - not now.

  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - rachel, you there?
  ans:
  - he...

- que:
  - who watched it?
  ans:
  - our son.

- que:
  - you wish i was around more?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you want to be around more?
  ans:
  - you're here to take my place, send me back into the void, and rob me of all i have.

- que:
  - who is it?
  ans:
  - he was alone on mount cithaeron.

- que:
  - see him?
  ans:
  - without the slightest delicacy... come, \" little swollen feet \".

- que:
  - but what, if i can't remember it?
  ans:
  - i lay awake till dawn came.

- que:
  - do you remember?
  ans:
  - it's a real feast, better than ours.

- que:
  - when will you leave?
  ans:
  - tomorrow at dawn.

- que:
  - why should i wait?
  ans:
  - i don't want that dream to come and torment me again.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - of course i know.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - come with me.

- que:
  - who could have imagined that?
  ans:
  - nobody dares drive it back to the abyss, even thought the man who does will marry jocasta, the queen of thebes.

- que:
  - there's an enigma in your life.
  ans:
  - where are you going?

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i don't want to know it.

- que:
  - when you came here, didn't you rid us of the sphinx?
  ans:
  - you didn't perform this act because you're wiser than we.

- que:
  - why hasn't he returned yet?
  ans:
  - creon is here.

- que:
  - shall i tell it before all or inside the house?
  ans:
  - before all.

- que:
  - what can his sentence be?
  ans:
  - death or exile.

- que:
  - who might the victim be?
  ans:
  - before you, the king was laius.

- que:
  - where can we find the traces of a crime which took place so long ago?
  ans:
  - here, the god said.

- que:
  - abroad?
  ans:
  - he was going to apollo's shrine, and he never returned.

- que:
  - no guard or travelling companion witnessed the murder?
  ans:
  - only one escaped.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - from one thing others can be deduced.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - that he wasn't killed by bandits but by a wayfarer.

- que:
  - who could prove it?
  ans:
  - the only living witness.

- que:
  - what frightens you?
  ans:
  - let me go home.

- que:
  - this is what you think?
  ans:
  - obey your own judgement, and beware of remaining here among us.

- que:
  - you look, and do not see the shame and evil in which you are.
  ans:
  - who's responsible for these lies, you or creon?

- que:
  - do you know that your kind, living and dead, curse you?
  ans:
  - one day you will see only darkness.

- que:
  - who begot me?
  ans:
  - i've got power and the people on my side.

- que:
  - how long ago was laius killed without a trace?
  ans:
  - a long time.

- que:
  - did he utter no prophecies?
  ans:
  - yes, winning the respect of everyone.

- que:
  - he didn't mention me, by chance... in his prophecies?
  ans:
  - in my presence, never.

- que:
  - then... into the death of laius, your king you made no inquiries?
  ans:
  - surely, but in vain.

- que:
  - in this case, why did tiresias not say anything?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - and you don't know that you two agree when he says i'm the murderer we are seeking?
  ans:
  - tell me.

- que:
  - don't you share power with her?
  ans:
  - of course i do.

- que:
  - what do i lack?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why you and creon?
  ans:
  - because your brother accuses me of laius's murder.

- que:
  - did he make this charge on his own or was he prompted?
  ans:
  - laius was killed at a crossroads.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - on the road to apollo's shrine...

- que:
  - how long ago?
  ans:
  - the news of his murder reached us shortly before your arrival in thebes.

- que:
  - how old?
  ans:
  - tall, with a big long beard.

- que:
  - does it frighten you so to be your mother's lover?
  ans:
  - many men dream of that.

- que:
  - maybe they live in fear?
  ans:
  - the truth must be sought.

- que:
  - but was he travelling alone, your husband laius, or with a great escort?
  ans:
  - he was with five men, four soldiers and a servant, on a cart.

- que:
  - and who said that?
  ans:
  - the servant who escaped.

- que:
  - is he here, this servant?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why do you ask me of him?
  ans:
  - ask me no questions, i said too much.

- que:
  - i am his wife.
  ans:
  - after such prophecies, with what heart could i return home, to my parents in corinth?

- que:
  - speak about what?
  ans:
  - good news for your house.

- que:
  - from whom?
  ans:
  - from corinth.

- que:
  - isn't his father, old polybus, king of corinth?
  ans:
  - he was.

- que:
  - is this the man?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - were you laius's servant?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what were you?
  ans:
  - shepherd.

- que:
  - where did you graze?
  ans:
  - on cithaeron, or thereabouts.

- que:
  - this man, do you know him?
  ans:
  - i'm trying to remember him.

- que:
  - why do you ask me?
  ans:
  - oedipus, your king, is the baby of that day.

- que:
  - what would you want me to say?
  ans:
  - i did.

- que:
  - was he your son or not?
  ans:
  - he wasn't mine, he was given me by... others.

- que:
  - he was laius's.
  ans:
  - who?

- que:
  - his slave or his son?
  ans:
  - this is a thing that cannot be said.

- que:
  - did she give you the baby?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - with what orders?
  ans:
  - to kill him.

- que:
  - why this atrocity?
  ans:
  - because she feared bad prophecies.

- que:
  - which ones?
  ans:
  - that he would kill his parents.

- que:
  - why did you allow him to be saved?
  ans:
  - out of pity.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - in a place with many trees in a row and many little streams and a green, green field.

- que:
  - you want a drink?
  ans:
  - i think we're out of beer.

- que:
  - we out of beer?
  ans:
  - you're empty.

- que:
  - what are we doing?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - should we stop?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:

  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - no more of this crap, all right?
  ans:
  - from now on, we act like a married couple.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who can understand such a flaming pile of bullshit?
  ans:
  - oh, jack.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you know, you shouldn't leave me with hank...... and put me in that position.

- que:
  - what position?
  ans:
  - jack, listen to me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - something's going on.

  ans:
  - it's you and hank being left alone together.

- que:
  - i'm supposed to feel guilty because of that?
  ans:
  - terry.

- que:
  - is that what it is?
  ans:
  - hank doesn't love her.

- que:
  - he said that to you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why did he tell you that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - he just blurted that out?
  ans:
  - seems odd.

- que:
  - how else do people tell each other things?
  ans:
  - when people say things like that they're doing other things.

- que:
  - what do you care?
  ans:
  - i don't.

- que:
  - yeah, what do you know?
  ans:
  - hank, people who know you like your work.

- que:
  - how about a spoonful of this...... \" dream come true \" jumbo split?
  ans:
  - i'd rather eat vomit.

  - do me a favor and don't tell jack, all right?
  ans:
  - allow me the joy of gloating.

- que:

  - yes.

- que:
  - how was your run?
  ans:
  - still wet.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - relax.

- que:
  - why is it that you say you love our children and they go unbathed for days?
  ans:
  - right now sean is upstairs sleeping in last night's piss.

- que:
  - who are you to judge me?
  ans:
  - oh, that was shitty.

- que:
  - accusing me of not loving my own children?
  ans:
  - that's just the way you fight, like a catty, bitchy woman.

- que:
  - and you know what?
  ans:
  - if you ever got them up in the last four or five nights...... you would've known he hadn't wet his bed.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - you never get the facts right.

- que:
  - then, later that night, he fucked my wife in the front seat of my car.
  ans:
  - so, what do you want me to do?

- que:
  - where were you?
  ans:
  - woke up, couldn't get to sleep, so i went for a walk.

- que:
  - did you ever go to sleep?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why didn't you come to bed?
  ans:
  - because i need to be made love to.

- que:
  - you gonna see him again?
  ans:
  - god.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - then it's over.

- que:
  - think making love is like smoking?
  ans:
  - it's...

- que:
  - it's what?
  ans:
  - it's a promise.

- que:
  - and he didn't say anything, either?
  ans:
  - he must have said something.

- que:
  - you want details, huh?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - you know what happened then?
  ans:
  - we parked and we fucked like crazy.

- que:
  - and you know what, jack?
  ans:
  - i came before he did.

- que:
  - that's enough, all right?
  ans:
  - enough.

- que:
  - you should be knocking my teeth out, but not you, huh?
  ans:
  - not you.

- que:
  - wanna watch us, jack?
  ans:
  - this comes to you...

- que:
  - you think you know yourself, but you know what?
  ans:
  - you're a pervert.

- que:
  - what do i say?
  ans:
  - gee, hank, that was last night...... and this is now, and i just don't know if i wanna fuck anymore.

- que:
  - where's hank?
  ans:
  - he's sleeping.

- que:
  - upstairs?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - which guy?
  ans:
  - the big fat mean guy.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - because if he doesn't hit him, he won't feel good about himself.

- que:
  - tanya, can you put two shirts on them?
  ans:
  - they get cold at night.

- que:
  - how's it going?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - take your car, okay?
  ans:
  - have fun.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'd like to just concentrate on hating his guts right now.

- que:
  - you know, the bar all the bag ladies drink in?
  ans:
  - alone in a bar for the first time in my life.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - never mind what happened.

- que:
  - don't you wanna stop that, terry?
  ans:
  - give me a reason, jack.

- que:
  - just one, you know?
  ans:
  - as if the luck of catching a fish would make me more lovable.

- que:
  - jack, how would you know if you hated me?
  ans:
  - you don't even know me.

- que:
  - does that mean i'm a cook...... an errand runner, a fucker, a goddamn cleaning lady?
  ans:
  - because if you, you bastard, lost all discipline and folded up...... and turned drunk and got bald and lost everything, i'd love you.

- que:
  - or is that just another one of the tricks i do for you?
  ans:
  - screw hank, shake hands, sit, roll over, play dead, fetch...... love me like a dog.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i love edith.

- que:
  - so when are you leaving?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why don't you come to bed?
  ans:
  - i wanna clean my house.

  ans:
  - i heard mom last night.

- que:

  ans:
  - natasha said you were leaving.

- que:
  - you know what that means?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what what means?
  ans:
  - now listen to me.

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - you know what's out there?
  ans:
  - the moon, the sun...

- que:
  - how many feet it is?
  ans:
  - so people say \" googol. \" \" it's googol.

- que:
  - see these rocks?
  ans:
  - guess how old they are.

- que:
  - hundred years old?
  ans:
  - nope.

- que:
  - who were the first people on the planet?
  ans:
  - if you believe in god, it's adam and eve...... and if you don't, apes.

- que:
  - did you know that they just found things that said that god had a wife?
  ans:
  - it's true.

- que:
  - what if they don't believe in god?
  ans:
  - no, i mean, people that look for him thought that.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i thought that's where you went to tell the kids.

- que:
  - couldn't you tell them?
  ans:
  - i don't want to.

- que:
  - is it just the kids?
  ans:
  - you can see them whenever you want.

- que:
  - just unpack my bags, okay?
  ans:
  - we can do this.

- que:
  - honey, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - somebody was mean to her at school.

- que:
  - want some coffee?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - drink?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - hey, hank?
  ans:
  - hank.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you knew all along.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - i'm drowning in shit.

- que:
  - where's sharon?
  ans:
  - she's outside waiting in the car.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - edith.

- que:
  - isn't it, edith?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - well, then why leave now?
  ans:
  - because i can.

- que:
  - you feeling any better?
  ans:
  - a little bit.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - grandfather's here.

- que:
  - mom, can't you tell him that i'm sick?
  ans:
  - i think i'il leave you two pals alone.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - open it up.

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:
  - fencing.

- que:
  - isn't that a wonderful beginning?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - is this a kissing book?
  ans:
  - wait, just wait.

- que:
  - when it gets good?
  ans:
  - keep your shirt on.

- que:
  - but what if something happens to you?
  ans:
  - i will always come for you.

- que:
  - but how can you be sure?
  ans:
  - this is true love.

- que:
  - you think this happens every day?
  ans:
  - westley didn't reach his destination.

- que:
  - despite humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride.
  ans:
  - would you like to meet her?

- que:
  - a word, my lady?
  ans:
  - we are but poor, lost circus performers.

- que:
  - is there a village nearby?
  ans:
  - there is nothing nearby.

- que:
  - what is that you're ripping?
  ans:
  - it's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder.

- que:
  - who's guilder?
  ans:
  - the country across the sea.

- que:
  - am i going mad or did the word \" think \" escape your lips?
  ans:
  - if there are, we'il all be dead.

- que:
  - anybody want a peanut?
  ans:
  - we'il reach the cliffs by dawn.

- que:
  - why are you doing that?
  ans:
  - making sure nobody's following us.

- que:
  - you're sure nobody's following us?
  ans:
  - as i told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable.

- que:
  - out of curiosity, why do you ask?
  ans:
  - those are the shrieking eels.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the eel doesn't get her.

- que:
  - do you know what that sound is, highness?
  ans:
  - only compared to some.

- que:
  - whoever he is, he's too late see?
  ans:
  - the cliffs of insanity.

- que:
  - did i make it clear that your job is at stake?
  ans:
  - he has very good arms.

- que:
  - hello there.
  ans:
  - he didn't fall?

- que:
  - thank you.
  ans:
  - slow going?

- que:
  - i do not suppose you could speed things up?
  ans:
  - if you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.

- que:
  - you don't know any way you'il trust me?
  ans:
  - nothing comes to mind.

- que:
  - do you always begin conversations this way?
  ans:
  - my father was slaughtered by a six fingered man.

- que:
  - how old were you?
  ans:
  - i was eleven years old.

- que:
  - you've done nothing but study swordplay?
  ans:
  - more pursuit than study lately.

- que:
  - you are ready, then?
  ans:
  - i thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain.

- que:
  - naturally, but i find thibault cancels out capo ferro, don't you?
  ans:
  - unless the enemy has studied his agrippa, which i have.

- que:
  - then why are you smiling?
  ans:
  - because i know something you don't know.

- que:
  - and what is that?
  ans:
  - i am not left handed.

- que:
  - what do i do?
  ans:
  - finish him, finish him.

- que:
  - which way is my way?
  ans:
  - pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder, in a few minutes, the man in black will come running around the bend.

- que:
  - so what happens now?
  ans:
  - sportsmanlike.

- que:
  - you mean, you'il put down your rock and i'il put down my sword, and we'il try to kill each other like civilized people?
  ans:
  - i could kill you now.

- que:
  - look, are you just fiddling around with me or what?
  ans:
  - i just want you to feel you're doing well.

- que:
  - were you burned by acid, or something like that?
  ans:
  - oh no.

- que:
  - why is that, do you think?
  ans:
  - well, i haven't fought just one person for so long.

- que:
  - why should that make such a difference?
  ans:
  - well, you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.

- que:
  - how did it end?
  ans:
  - the loser is nothing.

- que:
  - could this be a trap?
  ans:
  - i always think everything could be a trap, which is why i'm still alive.

- que:
  - and you're no match for my brains.
  ans:
  - perhaps an arrangement can be reached?

- que:
  - let me put it this way:have you ever heard of plato, aristotle, socrates?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - in that case, i challenge you to a battle of wits.

- que:
  - it is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
  ans:
  - for the princess?

- que:
  - all right:where is the poison?
  ans:
  - the battle of wits has begun.

- que:
  - are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's?
  ans:
  - now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given.

- que:
  - you've made your decision then?
  ans:
  - australia.

- que:
  - you'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - you've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - i don't see anything.

- que:
  - what's so funny?
  ans:
  - i'il tell you in a minute.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.

- que:
  - and what is that worth, the promise of a woman?
  ans:
  - you're very funny, highness.

- que:
  - you think your dearest love will save you?
  ans:
  - i never said he was my dearest love.

- que:
  - you admit me you do not love your fiance?
  ans:
  - he knows i do not love him.

- que:
  - what can i do for you?
  ans:
  - you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.

- que:
  - why loose your venom on me?
  ans:
  - you killed my love.

- que:
  - another prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - does it bother you to hear?
  ans:
  - nothing you can say will upset me.

- que:
  - and what am i?
  ans:
  - faithfulness he talked of, madam.

- que:
  - what have i done?
  ans:
  - he disappeared.

- que:
  - i told you, i would always come for you.
  ans:
  - can you move at all?

- que:
  - why didn't you wait for me?
  ans:
  - well, you were dead.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - they're kissing again.

- que:
  - do we have to hear the kissing part?
  ans:
  - someday, you may not mind so much...

- que:
  - so now, where were we here?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - well, one thing i will say.

- que:
  - since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
  ans:
  - i myself am often surprised at life's little quirks.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - is everything clear to you?
  ans:
  - we'il never succeed, we may as well die here.

- que:
  - i mean, what are the three terrors of the fire swamp?
  ans:
  - one:the flame spurts.

- que:
  - rodents of unusual size?
  ans:
  - i don't think they exist...

- que:
  - you mean you wish to surrender to me?
  ans:
  - very well, i accept.

- que:
  - ah, but how will you capture us?
  ans:
  - you have six fingers on your right hand, someone was looking for you...

- que:
  - where am i?
  ans:
  - the pit of despair.

- que:
  - then i'm here till i die?
  ans:
  - till they kill you, yeah.

- que:
  - then why bother curing me?
  ans:
  - the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

- que:
  - you don't believe me?
  ans:
  - you survived the fire swamp.

- que:
  - where is that written?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why do you do this?
  ans:
  - because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you she'd never marry that rotten humperdinck?
  ans:
  - yes, you're very smart.

- que:
  - you returned this westley to his ship?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - beloved, are you certain he still wants you?
  ans:
  - after all, it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp.

- que:
  - are we agreed?
  ans:
  - your princess is really a winning creature.

- que:
  - now, where is that secret knot?
  ans:
  - it's impossible to find.

- que:
  - are you coming down into the pit?
  ans:
  - westley's got his strength back.

- que:
  - beautiful, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it took me half a lifetime to invent it.

- que:
  - what did this do to you?
  ans:
  - tell me.

- que:
  - and remember, this is for posterity, so be honest, how do you feel?
  ans:
  - interesting.

- que:
  - any word from westley?
  ans:
  - too soon, my angel.

- que:
  - is everybody out?
  ans:
  - he's with the prince in the castle.

- que:
  - how many could you handle?
  ans:
  - i don't think more than ten.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - look, he bested you with strength, your greatness.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - to find the man in black, obviously.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - that is the sound of ultimate suffering.

- que:
  - his true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
  ans:
  - excuse me, pardon me, it's important.

- que:
  - you get there from this grove, yes?
  ans:
  - fezzik, jog his memory.

- que:
  - inigo?
  ans:
  - father, i have failed you for twenty years.

- que:
  - what did fezzik mean, \" he's dead?
  ans:
  - i mean, he didn't mean \" dead \"...

- que:
  - who gets humperdinck?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - who kills prince humperdinck?
  ans:
  - at the end, somebody's got to do it.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - nobody.

- que:
  - what did you read me this thing for?
  ans:
  - you know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - okay, all right, now, let's see.

- que:
  - where were we?
  ans:
  - oh yes.

- que:
  - have you any money?
  ans:
  - the king's stinking son fired me.

- que:
  - look, i'm retired.
  ans:
  - while you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?

- que:
  - besides, why would you want someone the king's stinking son fired?
  ans:
  - i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.

- que:
  - he is, eh?
  ans:
  - i'il take a look.

- que:
  - you got money?
  ans:
  - 65.

- que:
  - he probably owes you money, huh?
  ans:
  - well, i'il ask him.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - true... love...

- que:
  - why'd you say that name?
  ans:
  - you promised me that you would never say that name.

- que:
  - what, humperdinck?
  ans:
  - humperdinck.

- que:
  - give me the sixty five, i'm on the job.
  ans:
  - i make him better, humperdinck suffers?

- que:
  - that's a miracle pill?
  ans:
  - the chocolate coating makes it go down easier.

- que:
  - and you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
  ans:
  - an hour.

- que:
  - think it'il work?
  ans:
  - it would take a miracle.

- que:
  - what's the difference?
  ans:
  - we've got him.

- que:
  - has it been fifteen minutes?
  ans:
  - we can't wait the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

- que:
  - how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
  ans:
  - your guess is as good as mine...

- que:
  - why won't my arms move?
  ans:
  - you've been mostly dead all day.

- que:
  - where's buttercup?
  ans:
  - let me explain...

- que:
  - what are our liabilities?
  ans:
  - there is but one working castle gate...

- que:
  - and our assets?
  ans:
  - your brains, fezzik's strength, my steel.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - impossible.

- que:
  - my brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy?
  ans:
  - i mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.

- que:
  - where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
  ans:
  - over the albino, i think.

- que:
  - well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
  ans:
  - what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.

- que:
  - where did you get that?
  ans:
  - at miracle max's.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you can't even lift one.

- que:
  - true, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?
  ans:
  - don't pester him, he's had a hard day.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i hope we win...

- que:
  - should i be?
  ans:
  - brides often are, i'm told.

- que:
  - now?

  ans:
  - give us the gate key.

- que:
  - what was that for?
  ans:
  - because you've always been so kind to me.

- que:
  - it's simply incredible.
  ans:
  - won't that be nice?

- que:
  - have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now?
  ans:
  - gently.

- que:
  - good heavens.
  ans:
  - at a time like this that's all you can think to say?

- que:
  - are you still trying to win?
  ans:
  - i got married.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it never happened.

- que:
  - did you say, \" i do \"?
  ans:
  - a technicality that will shortly be remedied.

- que:
  - where's fezzik?
  ans:
  - i thought he was with you.

- que:
  - why does westley need helping?
  ans:
  - because he has no strength.

- que:
  - shall i dispatch him for you?
  ans:
  - ah, there you are.

- que:
  - have you ever considered piracy?
  ans:
  - you'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.

- que:
  - you feeling any better?
  ans:
  - a little bit.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - grandfather's here.

- que:
  - mom, can't you tell him that i'm sick?
  ans:
  - i think i'il leave you two pals alone.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - open it up.

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:
  - fencing.

- que:
  - isn't that a wonderful beginning?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - is this a kissing book?
  ans:
  - wait, just wait.

- que:
  - when it gets good?
  ans:
  - keep your shirt on.

- que:
  - but what if something happens to you?
  ans:
  - i will always come for you.

- que:
  - but how can you be sure?
  ans:
  - this is true love.

- que:
  - you think this happens every day?
  ans:
  - westley didn't reach his destination.

- que:
  - despite humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride.
  ans:
  - would you like to meet her?

- que:
  - a word, my lady?
  ans:
  - we are but poor, lost circus performers.

- que:
  - is there a village nearby?
  ans:
  - there is nothing nearby.

- que:
  - what is that you're ripping?
  ans:
  - it's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder.

- que:
  - who's guilder?
  ans:
  - the country across the sea.

- que:
  - am i going mad or did the word \" think \" escape your lips?
  ans:
  - if there are, we'il all be dead.

- que:
  - anybody want a peanut?
  ans:
  - we'il reach the cliffs by dawn.

- que:
  - why are you doing that?
  ans:
  - making sure nobody's following us.

- que:
  - you're sure nobody's following us?
  ans:
  - as i told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable.

- que:
  - out of curiosity, why do you ask?
  ans:
  - those are the shrieking eels.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the eel doesn't get her.

- que:
  - do you know what that sound is, highness?
  ans:
  - only compared to some.

- que:
  - whoever he is, he's too late see?
  ans:
  - the cliffs of insanity.

- que:
  - did i make it clear that your job is at stake?
  ans:
  - he has very good arms.

- que:
  - hello there.
  ans:
  - he didn't fall?

- que:
  - thank you.
  ans:
  - slow going?

- que:
  - i do not suppose you could speed things up?
  ans:
  - if you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.

- que:
  - you don't know any way you'il trust me?
  ans:
  - nothing comes to mind.

- que:
  - do you always begin conversations this way?
  ans:
  - my father was slaughtered by a six fingered man.

- que:
  - how old were you?
  ans:
  - i was eleven years old.

- que:
  - you've done nothing but study swordplay?
  ans:
  - more pursuit than study lately.

- que:
  - you are ready, then?
  ans:
  - i thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain.

- que:
  - naturally, but i find thibault cancels out capo ferro, don't you?
  ans:
  - unless the enemy has studied his agrippa, which i have.

- que:
  - then why are you smiling?
  ans:
  - because i know something you don't know.

- que:
  - and what is that?
  ans:
  - i am not left handed.

- que:
  - what do i do?
  ans:
  - finish him, finish him.

- que:
  - which way is my way?
  ans:
  - pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder, in a few minutes, the man in black will come running around the bend.

- que:
  - so what happens now?
  ans:
  - sportsmanlike.

- que:
  - you mean, you'il put down your rock and i'il put down my sword, and we'il try to kill each other like civilized people?
  ans:
  - i could kill you now.

- que:
  - look, are you just fiddling around with me or what?
  ans:
  - i just want you to feel you're doing well.

- que:
  - were you burned by acid, or something like that?
  ans:
  - oh no.

- que:
  - why is that, do you think?
  ans:
  - well, i haven't fought just one person for so long.

- que:
  - why should that make such a difference?
  ans:
  - well, you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.

- que:
  - how did it end?
  ans:
  - the loser is nothing.

- que:
  - could this be a trap?
  ans:
  - i always think everything could be a trap, which is why i'm still alive.

- que:
  - and you're no match for my brains.
  ans:
  - perhaps an arrangement can be reached?

- que:
  - let me put it this way:have you ever heard of plato, aristotle, socrates?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - in that case, i challenge you to a battle of wits.

- que:
  - it is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
  ans:
  - for the princess?

- que:
  - all right:where is the poison?
  ans:
  - the battle of wits has begun.

- que:
  - are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's?
  ans:
  - now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given.

- que:
  - you've made your decision then?
  ans:
  - australia.

- que:
  - you'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - you've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - i don't see anything.

- que:
  - what's so funny?
  ans:
  - i'il tell you in a minute.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.

- que:
  - and what is that worth, the promise of a woman?
  ans:
  - you're very funny, highness.

- que:
  - you think your dearest love will save you?
  ans:
  - i never said he was my dearest love.

- que:
  - you admit me you do not love your fiance?
  ans:
  - he knows i do not love him.

- que:
  - what can i do for you?
  ans:
  - you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.

- que:
  - why loose your venom on me?
  ans:
  - you killed my love.

- que:
  - another prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - does it bother you to hear?
  ans:
  - nothing you can say will upset me.

- que:
  - and what am i?
  ans:
  - faithfulness he talked of, madam.

- que:
  - what have i done?
  ans:
  - he disappeared.

- que:
  - i told you, i would always come for you.
  ans:
  - can you move at all?

- que:
  - why didn't you wait for me?
  ans:
  - well, you were dead.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - they're kissing again.

- que:
  - do we have to hear the kissing part?
  ans:
  - someday, you may not mind so much...

- que:
  - so now, where were we here?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - well, one thing i will say.

- que:
  - since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
  ans:
  - i myself am often surprised at life's little quirks.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - is everything clear to you?
  ans:
  - we'il never succeed, we may as well die here.

- que:
  - i mean, what are the three terrors of the fire swamp?
  ans:
  - one:the flame spurts.

- que:
  - rodents of unusual size?
  ans:
  - i don't think they exist...

- que:
  - you mean you wish to surrender to me?
  ans:
  - very well, i accept.

- que:
  - ah, but how will you capture us?
  ans:
  - you have six fingers on your right hand, someone was looking for you...

- que:
  - where am i?
  ans:
  - the pit of despair.

- que:
  - then i'm here till i die?
  ans:
  - till they kill you, yeah.

- que:
  - then why bother curing me?
  ans:
  - the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

- que:
  - you don't believe me?
  ans:
  - you survived the fire swamp.

- que:
  - where is that written?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why do you do this?
  ans:
  - because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you she'd never marry that rotten humperdinck?
  ans:
  - yes, you're very smart.

- que:
  - you returned this westley to his ship?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - beloved, are you certain he still wants you?
  ans:
  - after all, it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp.

- que:
  - are we agreed?
  ans:
  - your princess is really a winning creature.

- que:
  - now, where is that secret knot?
  ans:
  - it's impossible to find.

- que:
  - are you coming down into the pit?
  ans:
  - westley's got his strength back.

- que:
  - beautiful, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it took me half a lifetime to invent it.

- que:
  - what did this do to you?
  ans:
  - tell me.

- que:
  - and remember, this is for posterity, so be honest, how do you feel?
  ans:
  - interesting.

- que:
  - any word from westley?
  ans:
  - too soon, my angel.

- que:
  - is everybody out?
  ans:
  - he's with the prince in the castle.

- que:
  - how many could you handle?
  ans:
  - i don't think more than ten.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - look, he bested you with strength, your greatness.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - to find the man in black, obviously.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - that is the sound of ultimate suffering.

- que:
  - his true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
  ans:
  - excuse me, pardon me, it's important.

- que:
  - you get there from this grove, yes?
  ans:
  - fezzik, jog his memory.

- que:
  - inigo?
  ans:
  - father, i have failed you for twenty years.

- que:
  - what did fezzik mean, \" he's dead?
  ans:
  - i mean, he didn't mean \" dead \"...

- que:
  - who gets humperdinck?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - who kills prince humperdinck?
  ans:
  - at the end, somebody's got to do it.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - nobody.

- que:
  - what did you read me this thing for?
  ans:
  - you know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - okay, all right, now, let's see.

- que:
  - where were we?
  ans:
  - oh yes.

- que:
  - have you any money?
  ans:
  - the king's stinking son fired me.

- que:
  - look, i'm retired.
  ans:
  - while you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?

- que:
  - besides, why would you want someone the king's stinking son fired?
  ans:
  - i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.

- que:
  - he is, eh?
  ans:
  - i'il take a look.

- que:
  - you got money?
  ans:
  - 65.

- que:
  - he probably owes you money, huh?
  ans:
  - well, i'il ask him.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - true... love...

- que:
  - why'd you say that name?
  ans:
  - you promised me that you would never say that name.

- que:
  - what, humperdinck?
  ans:
  - humperdinck.

- que:
  - give me the sixty five, i'm on the job.
  ans:
  - i make him better, humperdinck suffers?

- que:
  - that's a miracle pill?
  ans:
  - the chocolate coating makes it go down easier.

- que:
  - and you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
  ans:
  - an hour.

- que:
  - think it'il work?
  ans:
  - it would take a miracle.

- que:
  - what's the difference?
  ans:
  - we've got him.

- que:
  - has it been fifteen minutes?
  ans:
  - we can't wait the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

- que:
  - how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
  ans:
  - your guess is as good as mine...

- que:
  - why won't my arms move?
  ans:
  - you've been mostly dead all day.

- que:
  - where's buttercup?
  ans:
  - let me explain...

- que:
  - what are our liabilities?
  ans:
  - there is but one working castle gate...

- que:
  - and our assets?
  ans:
  - your brains, fezzik's strength, my steel.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - impossible.

- que:
  - my brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy?
  ans:
  - i mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.

- que:
  - where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
  ans:
  - over the albino, i think.

- que:
  - well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
  ans:
  - what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.

- que:
  - where did you get that?
  ans:
  - at miracle max's.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you can't even lift one.

- que:
  - true, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?
  ans:
  - don't pester him, he's had a hard day.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i hope we win...

- que:
  - should i be?
  ans:
  - brides often are, i'm told.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - not yet.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - light him.

- que:
  - have you the ring?
  ans:
  - here comes my westley now.

- que:
  - then why is there fear behind your eyes?
  ans:
  - give us the gate key.

  ans:
  - you'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.

- que:
  - why argue when you can quit?
  ans:
  - and you say you want to know why decisions are made.

- que:
  - why argue about decisions you're not powerful enough to make for yourself?
  ans:
  - energy will treat you well, you know that.

- que:
  - what do you mean, i'm not going?
  ans:
  - i hope this isn't an inconvenience.

- que:
  - who told you you're supposed to go with me?
  ans:
  - nobody told me.

- que:
  - get yourself another assignment, will you, daph?
  ans:
  - everybody's an assignment.

- que:
  - are you threatenin 'me?
  ans:
  - don't be here when i come back.

- que:
  - you go tell them people that i'm going to tokyo and you're not, huh?
  ans:
  - you tell 'em that.

- que:
  - what chance does houston have of defeating tokyo tonight?
  ans:
  - both teams have fine players and different styles.

- que:
  - what about the rule changes?
  ans:
  - well, at houston, we kinda play a wide open system.

- que:
  - will you comment on a game where the rules are always changing?
  ans:
  - the game's always had rule changes.

- que:
  - what's the secret of your success?
  ans:
  - oh, it's no secret.

- que:
  - any comments?
  ans:
  - i don't think it will.

- que:
  - you know what i mean?
  ans:
  - yeah...

- que:
  - i just wanna get out there and hit them little fellas.
  ans:
  - you all right?

- que:
  - listen, stay close now, all right?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  ans:
  - all right?

- que:
  - so, he's technically dead?
  ans:
  - yes, unfortunately.

- que:
  - does he dream?
  ans:
  - no, there is no brain wave at all, no sort of consciousness.

- que:
  - who can say?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - it's alive, isn't it?
  ans:
  - you must sign.

- que:
  - it's embarrassing to misplace things.
  ans:
  - will you follow me, please?

- que:
  - you've misplaced some data?
  ans:
  - mm, the whole of the 13 th century.

- que:

- que:
  - hmm.
  ans:
  - what am i thinking?

- que:
