  ans:
  - to kill them.

- que:

  - no one called it a war.

- que:
  - want some more coffee?
  ans:
  - no... came down on one of my boats.

- que:
  - huh?

  ans:
  - i just got back from dan fawcett's place.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - hold it, you don't know that for a fact.

- que:
  - what are the facts?
  ans:
  - the santa rosa police think it's a felony murder.

- que:
  - how do they explain the dead birds all over the floor?
  ans:
  - santa rosa police figure they got in after the old man was killed.

- que:
  - are you coming?
  ans:
  - now take it easy, lady.

- que:
  - what do i owe you, deke?
  ans:
  - sebastian, hold it a minute.

- que:

- que:
  - where will we go?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, mitch.
  ans:
  - what happens when you run out of wood?

- que:
  - where are they heading?
  ans:
  - somewhere inland.

  - mitch?

  ans:
  - no.

- que:

  ans:
  - i said, i wonder if you could help me.

  ans:
  - oh, some of them are.

  - then why did she object to you?
  ans:
  - because she was afraid.

- que:

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - wesley.

- que:

- que:
  - when you're standing in a cardboard street talking about meeting george clooney.
  ans:
  - what's that supposed to mean?

- que:
  - doesn't that smack just a little bit of being a star?
  ans:
  - loads of people lose their partners to this disease.

- que:
  - eh?
  ans:
  - i'm not a saint, because i'd rob every penny from this calendar if it would buy me just one more hour with him.

- que:
  - are you coming?
  ans:
  - hello, love.

- que:
  - how's jem?
  ans:

- que:
  - is it important?
  ans:
  - very.

- que:
  - oh, god.
  ans:
  - what the hell's the matter with you people?

- que:
  - yeah, what was that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how else would you explain it?
  ans:
  - well, i can't. that's why we're conducting a little something called an investigation.

- que:
  - what's gonna happen to the baby now, sheriff?
  ans:
  - well, he'll be placed with child services until we can find a home for him.

- que:
  - you think the baby's... the baby's not from earth?
  ans:
  - we found him in a crater, just like you and mom found me.

- que:
  - is he okay?
  ans:
  - if you can believe it, all his crying is a good sign.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - uh... when does child services come and take him?

- que:
  - can you trace this call back to the cell phone?
  ans:
  - i can try.

- que:
  - so, uh, why am i here, if not for the, uh, pleasure of your company?
  ans:
  - it's time to repay old debts, lionel.

- que:
  - who do you think ended up with the prize?
  ans:
  - well, my son hasn't been listening to me for years.

- que:
  - lionel.
  ans:

- que:
  - why don't we call him evan?
  ans:
  - i think he likes it.

- que:
  - step back from what?
  ans:
  - well, maybe we shouldn't get so attached.

- que:
  - clark, what's happening?
  ans:
  - clark, wha...

- que:
  - what are you doing, son? an exciting new venture, something worthy of a captain of industry?
  ans:
  - i'm simply continuing where you left off, dad.

- que:
  - why not just come out and ask for it yourself?
  ans:
  - i'm here as a father who's concerned about the safety of his son.

- que:
  - you think she'd hesitate to do the same to you?
  ans:
  - i don't have it.

- que:
  - where is evan now?
  ans:
  - in the loft with lana.

- que:
  - what are we gonna tell the doctors... he's some second generation meteor freak?
  ans:
  - he'll either wind up in belle reve or a laboratory for the rest of his life.

- que:
  - if i were in trouble, and lex was the only one who could help, what would you do?
  ans:
  - you must be very kind to him, to teach him all he needs to know in rabbit land.

- que:
  - you know how to read?
  ans:
  - i've read all of clark's books.

- que:
  - the encyclopedia, huh?
  ans:
  - that's a pretty long book.

- que:
  - why are you looking at me like that?
  ans:
  - um... you are a very, very special boy, evan.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - like a real windmill.

- que:
  - mom's taking me to see a real windmill.
  ans:
  - can we go right now?

- que:
  - wanna come?
  ans:
  - um... evan...

- que:
  - i'm sure they love you very much.
  ans:
  - if you're not my mom and dad, where are they?

- que:
  - are we going to the windmill?
  ans:
  - uh... we will, but first, i want to take you to meet a friend of mine.

- que:
  - lex, is he gonna be all right?
  ans:
  - tell us what's happening.

- que:
  - charging for what?
  ans:
  - the theory we're working on is that once enough energy is stored, it's expended to fuel a burst of rapid cell division.

- que:
  - is there any way to stop it?
  ans:
  - my team believes a bone marrow transplant might slow the growth and bring his metabolism back to normal.

- que:
  - can we use my bone marrow?
  ans:
  - we're willing to do anything to help.

- que:
  - unbelievable.
  ans:
  - what's going to happen to evan if we can't?

- que:
  - what's wrong with me?
  ans:
  - prep the level 3 facility.

- que:
  - i'm dying, aren't i?
  ans:
  - evan, don't say that.

- que:
  - and if we can find your father... do you really think they're gonna find a cure for me overnight?
  ans:
  - it's like my life was just some sort of trick that was played on me.

- que:
  - don't talk like that, all right?
  ans:
  - we just have to keep trying.

- que:
  - would you go see if he's okay?
  ans:
  - i need to find his father.

- que:
  - how long was she pregnant for?
  ans:
  - well, last weekend, christina varrano had a party at her house, and karen apparently went nc 17 with some guy in the bedroom.

- que:
  - so she got pregnant and delivered a baby a week later?
  ans:
  - we need to find evan's father.

- que:
  - does tanner sutherland work here?
  ans:
  - yeah, he's over there.

- que:
  - tanner?
  ans:
  - leave your car around back, i'll get to it.

- que:
  - hey, were you at christina varrano's party last week?
  ans:
  - uh, i don't remember.

- que:
  - look, dude, i don't have a son, and...
  ans:
  - so you didn't hook up with karen gallagher?

- que:
  - i don't know what you're talking about, all right?
  ans:
  - i got work to do.

- que:
  - what's your problem?
  ans:
  - my problem is your son needs your help.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how could someone do that to their own son?
  ans:
  - clark, being a father is an enormous responsibility.

- que:
  - but what's more important right now is what are we gonna tell evan?
  ans:
  - maybe it's best i don't even tell him i found his father.

- que:
  - i'll talk to him, okay?
  ans:
  - i mean, i do have a little experience in that department.

- que:
  - clark, where is he?
  ans:
  - he works downtown... at massey's auto garage.

- que:
  - when can i see him?
  ans:
  - look, evan, um, sometimes, when you meet your biological father, it can be painful.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - just calm down, okay?
  ans:
  - stop telling me what to do, clark.

- que:
  - is there any possibility of an error?
  ans:
  - we've run the projections three times.

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - he's here in smallville, but he doesn't want to help.

- que:
  - you're saying evan's about to die?
  ans:
  - it's a lot worse than that.

- que:
  - what are you staring at?
  ans:
  - my father.

- que:
  - why won't you admit it?
  ans:
  - dad.

- que:
  - oh, my god what have i done?
  ans:
  - okay, dad, call me if you find him.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - evan's gone.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - it's happening again.

- que:
  - i'm gonna call clark, and we're gonna get you help, okay?
  ans:
  - it's coming.

- que:
  - the windmill that you told me about, remember?
  ans:
  - where the whole world stretches out around you.

- que:
  - chloe, has evan been here?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - power surges?
  ans:
  - yeah, they've been popping up all over town for the last hour.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - it's the dwp grid.

- que:
  - where's the most recent one?
  ans:
  - um...

- que:
  - why would lana and evan be way out there?
  ans:
  - the windmill.

- que:
  - the one at chandler field?
  ans:
  - you were right.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - he's gone.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - don't all my visits deserve to be celebrated, genevieve?
  ans:
  - some more than others.

- que:
  - mmm... do you have something for me?
  ans:
  - i most certainly do.

- que:
  - parenthood... it's an interesting phenomen on, isn't it?
  ans:
  - the lengths we go to... to protect our children.

- que:
  - how about a trade?
  ans:
  - you give me the stone that you stole from bridgette crosby, and i give you... the antidote.

- que:
  - is that understood?
  ans:
  - the element, genevieve.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - you did everything you could, clark.

- que:
  - all the times that i've run off or disappeared or almost died, how do you guys deal with that?
  ans:
  - it isn't easy, clark, but it does come with the territory.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i'm from another planet.

- que:
  - who knows if i can have kids?
  ans:
  - clark, your father and i couldn't have children.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i'm releasing our findings to every research facility across the globe.

- que:
  - mr. luthor... are you sure you want to release the findings?
  ans:
  - eventually...

- que:
  - that's great, i...
  ans:
  - are you kidding me?

- que:
  - are you ok?
  ans:
  - coach, i'll take care of him.

- que:
  - clark, what's the matter son?
  ans:
  - i hear ringing.

- que:
  - can you tell me where it's coming from?
  ans:
  - i need to go.

- que:
  - what, you didn't think i would trek all the way out here without having a chat with your doctor?
  ans:
  - right there.

- que:
  - what the hell are you doing here?
  ans:
  - your father he... wanted to see me.

- que:
  - did he ask you to tackle me to the floor while you're at it?
  ans:
  - he had something sharp, lex...

- que:
  - do you ever feel guilty?
  ans:
  - about sending your father to prison, i mean.

- que:
  - why would i?
  ans:
  - the man murdered his parents.

- que:

- que:
  - where's the artifact now, clark?
  ans:
  - i put it in a chamber in the cave wall.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell us about this earlier?
  ans:
  - with everything we've been through with jor el, i just wanted to close that chapter in my life.

- que:
  - and i think lionel luthor would disagree with that, don't you?
  ans:
  - and now that he knows about your powers, he's more dangerous than ever.

- que:
  - clark, what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - lionel luthor's dying, dad.

- que:
  - how can that be possible?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

  - no.

- que:
  - another convenient case of amnesia, huh?
  ans:
  - no, but whatever it is, i'm really sorry.

- que:
  - clark, you know what?
  ans:
  - it's a really valiant effort, but you've used up your lifetime allotment of apologies.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - don't play games with me, clark.

- que:
  - this isn't about you and me, alright?

  - i hope i'm not interrupting, but i'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem?
  ans:
  - you are told correct.

- que:
  - would... this be enough?

  - i'm sorry, all right?
  ans:
  - hey, don't worry about it.

- que:

- que:
  - let's go, shrek.
  ans:

  ans:
  - honestly.

- que:
  - you heard that, huh?
  ans:
  - the whole kingdom heard you.

- que:
  - him?
  ans:
  - you know, you didn't exactly roll out the welcome wagon.

  ans:
  - look at what he's done to you.

- que:
  - no, really?
  ans:
  - shh...

  ans:
  - then why don't we pop in there for a spell?

- que:
  - look, she's not seeing any clients today, ok?
  ans:
  - that's ok, buddy.

- que:
  - the union?
  ans:
  - we represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.

- que:
  - are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?
  ans:
  - uh... a little.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - stop it.

  ans:
  - whoa, what happened here?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - you both will be fine?
  ans:

  ans:
  - see, you're allergic to that stuff.

- que:
  - how do you feel?
  ans:
  - i don't feel any different.

  ans:
  - no, no, it's nobody's fault.

- que:
  - what was what?
  ans:
  - what your husband was mixed up in.

- que:
  - look, i know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but don't you think... you could pretend just for a moment that i'm a woman?
  ans:
  - i could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - on the street where you live.

- que:
  - how about getting out of here?
  ans:
  - come on, child.

  - you see this little fella here?
  ans:
  - oh, he worries.

- que:
  - who is it?
  ans:
  - it's me, peter.

- que:
  - why don't you confide in me and tell me what this is all about?
  ans:
  - there are three men.

- que:
  - promise me you'll never lie to me the way charles did.
  ans:
  - where's the money?

- que:
  - why do people have to tell lies?
  ans:
  - usually because they want something.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - mrs. lampert, it's me, the man who was in your room a few minutes ago.

- que:
  - who is it?
  ans:
  - it's the man you had the fight with.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the man i had the fight with, lady.

- que:
  - is he still there?
  ans:
  - yes, that's right.

- que:
  - what's he saying?
  ans:
  - don't trust him.

- que:
  - what was all that about?
  ans:
  - he...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - someone who wasn't in that photograph today.

- que:
  - are you still there, mr. bartholomew?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, mrs. lampert.

- que:
  - at les halles?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - were you followed?
  ans:
  - yes, by dyle.

- que:
  - carson?
  ans:
  - there's only one dyle connected with this affair, mrs. lampert.

- que:
  - it's enough to make you a vegetarian, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it's just lucky i'm not hanging next to one of those right now.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me you knew about dyle?
  ans:
  - i didn't see any point.

- que:
  - mr. bartholomew, what is all this about?
  ans:
  - the five men were your husband charles, the three men at his funeral yesterday...

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - by burying it, then reporting the germans had captured it.

- que:
  - may i have a cigarette, please?
  ans:
  - i can't stand those things.

- que:
  - what was wrong with that one?
  ans:
  - nothing, i guess.

- que:
  - have you any idea what these things cost over here?
  ans:
  - please go on, mr. bartholomew.

- que:
  - what happened then?
  ans:
  - carson dyle was dead, but scobie was able to travel.

- que:
  - la soupe, c'est pour qui?
  ans:
  - pour moi.

- que:
  - where was i?
  ans:
  - carson dyle was dead.

- que:
  - we know what happened from the bits we were able to paste together, but we still have no proof.
  ans:
  - but if they stole all that money, why can't you arrest them?

- que:
  - what's this got to do with the c. i. o.?
  ans:
  - c. i. a., mrs. lampert.

- que:
  - why me?
  ans:
  - nice to see you.

- que:
  - when did you arrive?
  ans:

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - good morning, mr. dyle.

- que:
  - reggie?
  ans:
  - it's the only name i've got.

- que:
  - he was my brother.
  ans:
  - what do you want to know?

- que:
  - your brother?
  ans:
  - the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans, but i think they did it...

- que:
  - how can i?
  ans:
  - you lied to me just the way charles did.

- que:
  - i can't call you that anymore, can i?
  ans:
  - take me a while to get used to your new name.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - do anything funny or try to talk to anyone and i'll kill you, dyle.

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - we wait.

- que:
  - do i knock or something?
  ans:
  - the view had better be worth it.

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - i was afraid of that.

- que:
  - to ask me that?
  ans:
  - she has it.

- que:
  - supposing i had it... which i don't... do you really think i'd just hand it over to you?
  ans:
  - step back.

- que:
  - back where?
  ans:
  - that's the idea.

- que:
  - is that you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you gonna open up?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - oh, i met a man with sharp nails.

- que:
  - scobie?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - w w what is that stuff?

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is there a mrs. dyle?
  ans:
  - yes, but we're divorced.

- que:
  - why couldn't you just look at his feet?
  ans:
  - because he's wearing moccasins.

- que:
  - which one are you?
  ans:
  - a truthful whitefoot.

- que:
  - do you wanna look at my feet?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you just said an horrible word.
  ans:
  - can't you be serious?

- que:
  - what did i say?
  ans:
  - serious.

- que:
  - how about that, hmm?
  ans:
  - reggie, cut it out.

- que:
  - now what are you doing?
  ans:
  - cutting it out.

- que:
  - who told you to do that?
  ans:
  - you did.

- que:
  - ain't that cute?
  ans:
  - they've got jean louis.

- que:
  - are you a real cowboy?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure i am, kid.

- que:
  - howdy, miz lampert.
  ans:
  - so where's your gun?

- que:
  - who invited him?
  ans:
  - well, herman, i see you had a happy landing.

- que:
  - then who does?
  ans:
  - i don't know, herman.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - or you.

- que:
  - don't you see?
  ans:
  - if he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

- que:
  - why don't we search their rooms?
  ans:
  - that's all right with us.

- que:
  - you have something to hide?
  ans:
  - then there are no objections.

- que:
  - who gets your vote?
  ans:
  - scobie.

- que:
  - tex?
  ans:
  - man, that's charlie's stuff.

- que:
  - why bother him?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - sure there's nothing missing here?
  ans:
  - no, everything's here.

- que:
  - meaning what?
  ans:
  - suppose one of us has it.

- que:
  - now, if you had a treasure, where would you hide it?
  ans:
  - i would bury it in the garden.

- que:
  - well, if you had to hide it in this room, where would you put it?
  ans:
  - up there.

- que:
  - you know something?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do you mean, no?
  ans:
  - up there.

  ans:
  - yeah?

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - he's over in my room.

- que:
  - oh, now, who would've done a mean thing like that?
  ans:
  - i'm not quite sure.

- que:
  - a man drowned in his bed?
  ans:
  - impossible.

- que:
  - which is it?
  ans:
  - dyle.

- que:
  - didn't you know it was against the law to register under an assumed name?
  ans:
  - no, i didn't.

- que:
  - gideon?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - or tex?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i think tex did it.

- que:
  - why do you think tex did it?
  ans:
  - because i really suspect gideon, and it's always the person you don't suspect.

- que:
  - what's so illogical about that?
  ans:
  - you just said it's always the one you don't suspect.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - women.

- que:
  - what, like scobie?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you remember when he danced down here by the river in an american in paris... without a care in the world?
  ans:
  - mmm.

- que:
  - want some?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - what makes you think that this someone is going to be satisfied with three?
  ans:
  - he wants it all.

- que:
  - what, assassinate someone?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who put that there?
  ans:
  - it's the house detective.

- que:
  - why don't you have a girl in there?
  ans:
  - god, you're a pest.

- que:
  - can i come in?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - got you.

- que:
  - did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
  ans:
  - the shower's in there.

- que:
  - why don't you call one of them?
  ans:
  - i dare you.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - taking off my shoes.

- que:
  - did you ever hear of anyone taking a shower with their shoes on?
  ans:
  - i usually sing a medley of old favorites when i'm in the shower.

- que:
  - any requests?
  ans:
  - come in and watch.

- que:
  - how often do you go through this little ritual?
  ans:
  - bartholomew.

- que:
  - are you sure there's no mistake?
  ans:
  - none whatsoever.

- que:
  - is something wrong?
  ans:
  - you're probably weak from hunger.

- que:
  - i don't suppose you know who the murderer is, do you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - become the next victim?
  ans:
  - it's a start, anyway.

- que:
  - well, i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings, can i?
  ans:
  - all right, get set for the story of my life.

- que:
  - fiction or nonfiction?
  ans:
  - eh...

- que:
  - are you going to listen?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - you mean, you're a thief?
  ans:
  - well, that's not exactly the term i'd have chosen, but it sort of captures the spirit of the thing.

- que:
  - adam canfield?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - is there a mrs. canfield?
  ans:
  - yes, but we're divorced.

- que:
  - how did i lead you on?
  ans:
  - i don't suppose so.

- que:
  - hasn't it occurred to you that i'm having a tough time keeping my hands off you?
  ans:
  - oh, you should see your face.

- que:
  - what's the matter with it?
  ans:
  - it's lovely.

- que:
  - now what's the trouble?
  ans:
  - i'm not hungry anymore.

- que:
  - you don't look so bad in this light.
  ans:
  - isn't it glorious?

- que:
  - why do you think i brought you here?
  ans:
  - maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work... the competition was turning out.

- que:
  - pretty good, huh?
  ans:
  - i taught them everything they do.

- que:
  - oh, did they do that kind of thing way back in your day?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - not allowed to kiss back, huh?
  ans:
  - well, come on.

- que:
  - are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - it's 3:30 in the morning.

- que:
  - three of them, all in their pyjamas?
  ans:
  - c'est ridicule.

- que:
  - what is it, some new american fad?
  ans:
  - and now your friend who lives here, uh, the one from texas, he has disappeared into thin air.

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - i wish i knew.

- que:
  - madame?
  ans:
  - tell me, mr. dyle.

- que:
  - where were you at 3:30 a. m.?
  ans:

- que:
  - and you, mrs. lampert?
  ans:
  - i was too.

- que:
  - in mr. dyle's room?
  ans:
  - no, in my room.

- que:
  - obviously you're telling the truth, for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
  ans:
  - and if i were you, i wouldn't stay in my pyjamas.

- que:
  - you're gonna go looking for him now?
  ans:
  - if the police find him first, they're not going to turn over that quarter of a million to us.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:

  ans:
  - when i was at the top of my game, i felt connected to everything.

- que:
  - mrs. cordell?

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:

  - maybe it was a wig?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - you wanna sit down?
  ans:
  - i'm fine, goddamn it.

- que:
  - looks like a. 38 to me.
  ans:
  - why don't you lay down?

- que:
  - why'd he put a. 38 slug in his mouth?
  ans:
  - same reason he died on the jurisdiction line.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - the clock on the surveillance camera is three seconds behind the 911 clock.

- que:
  - all right, and...?
  ans:
  - we think he made the call before he killed her.

- que:
  - could this good samaritan be the same guy you saw at the atm machine?
  ans:

- que:
  - you got those atm tapes?
  ans:
  - no.

  ans:
  - let's go.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - want some coffee?
  ans:
  - no, go home.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - mr. mccaleb, did you think this was over?
  ans:
  - i can't comment, i don't know anything about anything.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's all right.

- que:
  - paper said something you didn't like?
  ans:
  - ballistics will match this slug with the one in bolotov's mouth.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - i shot him two years ago.

- que:
  - any idea why?
  ans:
  - i had a media profile, so did he.

- que:
  - what do you make of that?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i'll probably just let that guide me.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - police work can get kind of heavy on you.

- que:
  - you got anyone at home?
  ans:
  - next time you come around this dock, this mexican will kick your ass.

- que:
  - we're almost there.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - sir, are you sure about this?
  ans:
  - i told you, we're going to be all right.

- que:
  - yes, sir?
  ans:
  - given your situation, i can't say i understand your reasons...... for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.

- que:
  - what's that, sir?
  ans:
  - to trust me.

- que:
  - you wanna talk?
  ans:
  - they're just dreams.

- que:
  - are we ready to go?
  ans:
  - we're already late.

- que:
  - how fast are they moving?
  ans:
  - control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour.

- que:
  - how deep are they?
  ans:
  - almost 2000 meters.

- que:
  - what about the scans from the osiris?
  ans:
  - they can't be accurate.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - a sentinel for every man, woman and child in zion.

- que:
  - what are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - we're gonna do what commander lock ordered.

- que:
  - and does the commander have a plan for stopping 250, 000 sentinels?
  ans:
  - a strategy is still being formulated.

- que:
  - what do you think we should do, morpheus?
  ans:
  - we should proceed as ordered...

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.... however, i must ask one of you for help.

- que:
  - do you understand what you're asking?
  ans:
  - i am asking that one ship remain here in our place...... in case the oracle should attempt to contact us.

- que:
  - what happens when you get back to zion...... and the commander throws you in the stockade?
  ans:
  - he won't.

- que:
  - how did you know someone was here?
  ans:
  - he gave you this.

- que:
  - is everything all right, sir?
  ans:
  - the meeting is over.

- que:
  - agents?
  ans:
  - go.

- que:
  - do we proceed?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i can't figure it out.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - shit, you should've seen him.

- que:
  - where is he now?
  ans:
  - he's doing his superman thing.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - this is the nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through gate three.

- que:
  - are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?
  ans:
  - i'm just here to keep the peace.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - i want the ship ready to go as soon as possible.

- que:
  - morpheus and lock?
  ans:
  - niobe.

- que:
  - captain niobe?
  ans:
  - she used to be with morpheus.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - morpheus went to the oracle.

- que:
  - doesn't he have anything better to do?
  ans:
  - you know what they say about the life you save.

- que:
  - can i carry that for you?
  ans:
  - no, i can carry my own bag.

- que:
  - trinity?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - hey, you know, next year i'm old enough to join a crew, right?
  ans:
  - i've been thinking about it, and i've made my decision.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - neo.

- que:
  - something big is happening, isn't it?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - what would you advise?
  ans:
  - the truth.

- que:
  - what makes you so sure?
  ans:
  - consider what we have seen, councillor.

- que:
  - are you thinking what i'm thinking?
  ans:
  - i am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow.

- que:
  - how long do we charge the neb?
  ans:
  - twenty four, maybe 30 hours.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - what are you feeding these two?
  ans:
  - every ship up there's been home two, even three times more than the nebuchadnezzar.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you know why.

- que:
  - you think cas thinks it's fair that i'm here and dozer's not?
  ans:
  - i lost two brothers to that ship, link.

- que:
  - how can you say that to me?
  ans:
  - because of morpheus.

- que:
  - they started yet?
  ans:
  - only councillor hamann's opening prayer.

- que:
  - follow me.
  ans:
  - why?

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - it's okay, you can tell me.

- que:
  - you feel this?
  ans:
  - i'm never letting go.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - i'll make it.

- que:
  - did you see that agent?
  ans:
  - i've never seen anything like that.

- que:
  - care for some company?
  ans:
  - councillor hamann.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - i just haven't been able to sleep much.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - that you are in fact still human.

- que:
  - have you ever been to the engineering level?
  ans:
  - i love to walk there at night.

- que:
  - would you like to see it?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - interesting, isn't it?
  ans:
  - the power to give life...

- que:
  - the idea is pure nonsense...... but it does make one wonder just...... what is control?
  ans:
  - if we wanted, we could shut these machines down.

- que:
  - that's control, isn't it?
  ans:
  - if we wanted, we could smash them to bits.

- que:
  - is that your point, councillor?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is that why there are no young men on the council?
  ans:
  - good point.

- que:
  - see that machine?
  ans:
  - it has something to do with recycling our water supply.

- que:
  - is he here?
  ans:
  - bane.

- que:
  - is something wrong?
  ans:
  - no, i'm fine.

- que:
  - you're gonna see the oracle?
  ans:
  - there's no time.

- que:
  - am i still in charge of our defense system?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - then why did you allow the nebuchadnezzar to leave?
  ans:
  - because i believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am seraph.

- que:
  - apologize for what?
  ans:
  - for this.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - that you are the one.

- que:
  - these are back doors, aren't they?
  ans:
  - programmer access.

- que:
  - how do they work?
  ans:
  - a code is hidden in tumblers.

- que:
  - then what are you?
  ans:
  - i protect that which matters most.

- que:
  - how do you feel?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - you're not human, are you?
  ans:
  - it's tough to get more obvious than that.

- que:
  - ... how can i trust you?
  ans:
  - bingo.

- que:
  - do you already know if i'll take it?
  ans:
  - wouldn't be much of an oracle if i didn't.

- que:
  - but if you already know, how can i make a choice?
  ans:
  - because you didn't come here to make the choice.

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - same reason.

- que:
  - but why help us?
  ans:
  - we're all here to do what we're all here to do.

- que:
  - are there other programs like you?
  ans:
  - well, not like me, but...

- que:
  - see those birds?
  ans:
  - at some point, a program was written to govern them.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - they have their reasons...... but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.

- que:
  - and why would a program be deleted?
  ans:
  - maybe it breaks down.

- que:
  - what happens when you go through the door?
  ans:
  - i see trinity...... and something happens...... something bad.

- que:
  - do you see her die?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - then why can't i see what happens to her?
  ans:
  - we can never see past the choices we don't understand.

- que:
  - are you saying i have to choose whether trinity lives or dies?
  ans:
  - no, you've already made the choice.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because you're the one.

- que:
  - what happens if i fail?
  ans:
  - then zion will fall.

- que:
  - the keymaker?
  ans:
  - he disappeared.

- que:
  - what do all men with power want?
  ans:
  - more power.

- que:
  - did you get my package?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - smith?
  ans:
  - he's not reading like an agent.

- que:
  - surprised to see me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - our connection.

- que:
  - and what reason is that?
  ans:
  - i killed you, mr. anderson.

- que:
  - what's happening to him?
  ans:
  - don't know.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - it was smith.

- que:
  - now there's more than one of them?
  ans:
  - a lot more.

- que:
  - how is that possible?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - is that what he was doing to you?
  ans:
  - i don't know what he was doing...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it felt like i was back in that hallway.

- que:
  - are there two among you that would answer such a call?
  ans:
  - captain soren of the vigilant will answer the council's call.

- que:
  - you understand the situation, captain soren?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - is there another?
  ans:
  - captain, i think we should volunteer.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you have gone crazy.

- que:
  - is there no other?
  ans:
  - be hard for any man to risk his life...... especially if he doesn't understand the reason.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - thank you, captain niobe.

- que:
  - niobe, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - what i can.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because some things never change, jason...... and some things do.

- que:
  - what can you see, neo?
  ans:
  - it's strange.

- que:
  - encrypted?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - is that good for us or bad for us?
  ans:
  - well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - and the legendary morpheus.

- que:
  - drink?
  ans:
  - of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.

- que:
  - but then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
  ans:
  - chteau haut briond, 1959.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - it's like wiping your ass with silk.

- que:
  - the question is, do you know why you are here?
  ans:
  - we are looking for the keymaker.

- que:
  - ... what?
  ans:
  - you know the answer to that question.

- que:
  - but do you?
  ans:
  - you think you do, but you do not.

- que:
  - you can see it, neo, yes?
  ans:
  - she does not understand why.

- que:
  - is it the wine?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is the reason?
  ans:
  - and soon it does not matter.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - please, ma chrie, i have told you.

- que:
  - are you certain the oracle didn't say anything else?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - we are still alive.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - a kiss.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - i want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you love her.

- que:
  - why don't you sample this instead?
  ans:
  - trinity.

- que:
  - why should we trust you?
  ans:
  - if i don't deliver you to the keymaker, she can kill me.

- que:
  - aren't you, boys?
  ans:
  - yes, mistress.

- que:
  - how many people keep silver bullets in their gun?
  ans:
  - you betray me.

- que:
  - cause?
  ans:
  - there is no cause for this.

- que:
  - lipstick?
  ans:
  - lipstick.

- que:
  - i'll handle them.
  ans:
  - what craziness are you talking about, woman?

- que:
  - you'll handle us?
  ans:
  - you know, your predecessors had much more respect.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - he's just a man.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - another way.

- que:
  - what about neo?
  ans:
  - he can handle himself.

- que:
  - link, where am i?
  ans:
  - you won't believe this, but you're way up in the mountains.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - the twins are after morpheus and trinity.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

- que:
  - are you watching this, link?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - any suggestions?
  ans:
  - turn right.

- que:
  - you sure about this?
  ans:
  - the freeway, i mean.

- que:
  - link, what did i tell you?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - just follow the sirens.

- que:
  - good.
  ans:
  - what is that?

- que:
  - any change?
  ans:
  - they hit some iron ore here.

- que:
  - how much?
  ans:
  - an hour, maybe.

- que:
  - did he say bomb?
  ans:
  - but like all systems, it has a weakness.

- que:
  - twenty seven blocks?
  ans:
  - there is a power station.

- que:
  - what do you need us for?
  ans:
  - neo could take them out easier than we could.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed.

- que:
  - how long will that take?
  ans:
  - exactly 314 seconds.

- que:
  - how do you know all this?
  ans:
  - i know because i must know.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i get paid to count them here.

- que:
  - how much time?
  ans:
  - twelve minutes.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - what is it, niobe?
  ans:
  - i can't help it, morpheus.

- que:
  - what if all this, the prophecy, everything, is bullshit?
  ans:
  - then tomorrow we may all be dead.

- que:
  - but how would that be different from any other day?
  ans:
  - this is a war, and we are soldiers.

- que:
  - time?
  ans:
  - three minutes.

- que:
  - what about soren?
  ans:
  - there.

- que:
  - what about the grid?
  ans:

- que:
  - in five minutes, i'll tear that building down.
  ans:
  - what are you...?

- que:
  - how much further?
  ans:
  - here, just here.

- que:
  - you haven't figured that out?
  ans:
  - still using all the muscles except the one that matters.

- que:
  - would that include a bullet from this gun?
  ans:
  - hold it right there, little lady.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am the architect.

- que:
  - why am i here?
  ans:
  - your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation...... inherent to the programming of the matrix.

- que:
  - what others?
  ans:
  - the matrix is older than you know.

- que:
  - five before me?
  ans:
  - he's lying.

- que:
  - but we already know what you are going to do, don't we?
  ans:
  - she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - it's moving faster than anything i've seen.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - if we don't do something in 24 hours, zion will be destroyed.

- que:
  - how do you know that?
  ans:
  - i was told it would happen.

- que:
  - by whom?
  ans:
  - it doesn't matter.

- que:
  - how can the prophecy be true if the war isn't over?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - what are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - they're just out of emp range.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - some sort of malfunction?
  ans:
  - no one knows.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - once the machines were done with us, they started digging again.

- que:
  - you found one?
  ans:

- que:
  - mr., is it sure of this?
  ans:
  - i have told you that we will be well.

- que:
  - yes, mister?
  ans:
  - given your situation, i can say that i understand your reasons...... para to offer as volunteer to operate on board my ship.

- que:
  - what thing would it be mister?
  ans:
  - that you trust my.

- que:
  - do you want to speak?
  ans:
  - they are only dreams.

- que:
  - are we clever to leave?
  ans:
  - we already go retarded.

- que:
  - how so quick they move?
  ans:
  - control estimates that 100 meters descend per hour.

- que:
  - how so deep they have arrived?
  ans:

- que:
  - and what is there of the escaneos of the osiris?
  ans:
  - they cannot be exact.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it is not possible.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - a sentry for each man, woman and boy of zion.

- que:
  - what will we make in this respect?
  ans:
  - we will make that that the commandant lock ordered us.

- que:
  - and the commandant has a plan to stop 250. 000 sentries?
  ans:
  - a strategy is still tracing.

- que:
  - what do you believe that we should make morfeo?
  ans:
  - i believe that we should...

- que:
  - what does it happen?
  ans:
  - however...

- que:
  - do you understand what you are requesting?
  ans:
  - i am requesting that a ship remain here, in our place, only just in case the oracle he/ she tries to contact us.

- que:
  - and what it will happen when you return to zion and does the commandant throw you to a cell?
  ans:
  - he/ she won't make it.

- que:
  - how did you know that somebody was here?
  ans:
  - he/ she left you this.

- que:
  - is all well mister?
  ans:
  - the meeting concluded, return to their exits.

  - mr.?
  ans:
  - i want you to prepare the ship to leave as soon as possible.

- que:
  - morfeo and lock?

- que:
  - what did it happen?
  ans:
  - morfeo went to see to the oracle, then everything changed.

  ans:
  - clear.

- que:
  - interesting, not?
  ans:

- que:
  - what is the control?
  ans:
  - if we wanted, we would rot to turn off these machines.

- que:
  - is that control, not?
  ans:
  - if we wanted, we would rot to break them in pieces.

- que:
  - is that the point councilman?
  ans:
  - no, it is not the point.

- que:
  - that is the reason for the one that there is not young in the council?
  ans:
  - good point.

- que:
  - why he/ she doesn't tell me that that does he/ she have in mind councilman?
  ans:
  - there are so many things in this world...... que doesn't understand.

- que:
  - councilman, i am still to position of our defensive system?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - then why it allowed that the nebuchadnezzar left?

- que:
  - why don't you come and do you sit down?
  ans:
  - maybe better it is stopped.

- que:
  - you are not human, or yes?
  ans:
  - it is difficult to become more obvious than that.

- que:
  - how can i trust you?
  ans:
  - you guessed right.

- que:
  - do you already know if i will take it?
  ans:
  - it would not be an oracle if he/ she didn't know it.

- que:
  - how can i make an election?
  ans:
  - because you didn't come to my to make the election ; you have already made it.

- que:

- que:
  - do you see those birds?
  ans:
  - in a certain point a program it was written to govern them.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - there are reasons, but usually a program elije the exile when he/ she faces to be erased.

- que:
  - and why would it be erased a program?
  ans:
  - maybe because it works bad, maybe another program better you cre in its substitution, happens the whole time.

- que:
  - in your dreams, or not?
  ans:
  - the door made of light.

- que:
  - what does it happen when you cross the door?
  ans:
  - i see trinity.

- que:
  - do you see it die?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - then why i am not able to to see what happens him?

- que:
  - you understand the situation captain sorren?
  ans:
  - yes mrs...

- que:
  - is there some other one?
  ans:
  - i believe that we should offer.

- que:
  - have you become crazy?
  ans:
  - he/ she closes the mouth he/ she took a bath.

- que:

  ans:
  - it is difficult for any man to take a risk their life, especially if he/ she doesn't understand the reason.

- que:
  - niobe, what are you making?

  ans:
  - chateau aubry 1959.

- que:
  - the question is, you know why are they here?
  ans:
  - we look for the locksmith.

- que:
  - the locksmith's nature is to be a means, not an end...... entonces to look for it is to be looking for a means for...... hacer... what?
  ans:
  - you know the answer to that question.

- que:
  - but do you know it?
  ans:
  - you believe to know it, but it is not this way.

  - sir, are you sure about this?
  ans:
  - i told you, we're going to be all right.

- que:
  - yes, sir?
  ans:
  - given your situation, i can't say i understand your reasons...... for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.

- que:
  - what's that, sir?
  ans:
  - to trust me.

- que:
  - you wanna talk?
  ans:

- que:
  - what do you think we should do, morpheus?
  ans:
  - we should proceed as ordered...

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.... however, i must ask one of you for help.

- que:
  - do you understand what you're asking?
  ans:
  - i am asking that one ship remain here in our place...... in case the oracle should attempt to contact us.

  - where is he now?
  ans:

  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - what would you advise?
  ans:
  - the truth.

- que:
  - what makes you so sure?
  ans:
  - consider what we have seen, councillor.

- que:
  - are you thinking what i'm thinking?
  ans:
  - i am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow.

- que:
  - how long do we charge the neb?
  ans:
  - twenty four, maybe 30 hours.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - what are you feeding these two?
  ans:
  - every ship up there's been home two, even three times more than the nebuchadnezzar.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you know why.

- que:
  - you think cas thinks it's fair that i'm here and dozer's not?
  ans:
  - i lost two brothers to that ship, link.

- que:
  - how can you say that to me?
  ans:
  - because of morpheus.

- que:
  - they started yet?
  ans:
  - only councillor hamann's opening prayer.

- que:
  - follow me.
  ans:
  - why?

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - it's okay, you can tell me.

- que:
  - you feel this?
  ans:
  - i'm never letting go.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - i'll make it.

- que:
  - did you see that agent?
  ans:
  - i've never seen anything like that.

- que:
  - care for some company?
  ans:
  - councillor hamann.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - i just haven't been able to sleep much.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - that you are in fact still human.

- que:
  - have you ever been to the engineering level?
  ans:
  - i love to walk there at night.

- que:
  - would you like to see it?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - interesting, isn't it?
  ans:
  - the power to give life...

- que:
  - the idea is pure nonsense...... but it does make one wonder just...... what is control?
  ans:
  - if we wanted, we could shut these machines down.

- que:
  - that's control, isn't it?
  ans:
  - if we wanted, we could smash them to bits.

- que:
  - is that your point, councillor?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is that why there are no young men on the council?
  ans:
  - good point.

- que:
  - see that machine?
  ans:
  - it has something to do with recycling our water supply.

- que:
  - ls he here?
  ans:
  - bane.

- que:
  - is something wrong?
  ans:
  - no, i'm fine.

- que:
  - you're gonna see the oracle?
  ans:
  - there's no time.

- que:
  - am i still in charge of our defense system?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - then why did you allow the nebuchadnezzar to leave?
  ans:
  - because i believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am seraph.

- que:
  - apologize for what?
  ans:
  - for this.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - that you are the one.

- que:
  - these are back doors, aren't they?
  ans:
  - programmer access.

- que:
  - how do they work?
  ans:
  - a code is hidden in tumblers.

- que:
  - then what are you?
  ans:
  - i protect that which matters most.

- que:
  - so...... let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.
  ans:
  - you turned out all right, didn't you?

- que:
  - you're not human, are you?
  ans:
  - it's tough to get more obvious than that.

- que:
  - ... how can i trust you?
  ans:
  - bingo.

- que:
  - do you already know if i'll take it?
  ans:
  - wouldn't be much of an oracle if i didn't.

- que:
  - but if you already know, how can i make a choice?
  ans:
  - because you didn't come here to make the choice.

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - same reason.

- que:
  - but why help us?
  ans:
  - we're all here to do what we're all here to do.

- que:
  - are there other programs like you?
  ans:
  - well, not like me, but....

- que:
  - see those birds?
  ans:
  - at some point, a program was written to govern them.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - they have their reasons...... but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.

- que:
  - and why would a program be deleted?
  ans:
  - maybe it breaks down.

- que:
  - what happens when you go through the door?
  ans:
  - i see trinity...... and something happens...... something bad.

- que:
  - do you see her die?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - then why can't i see what happens to her?
  ans:
  - we can never see past the choices we don't understand.

- que:
  - are you saying i have to choose whether trinity lives or dies?
  ans:
  - no, you've already made the choice.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because you're the one.

- que:
  - what happens if i fail?
  ans:
  - then zion will fall.

- que:
  - the keymaker?
  ans:
  - he disappeared.

- que:
  - what do all men with power want?
  ans:
  - more power.

- que:
  - did you get my package?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - smith?
  ans:
  - he's not reading like an agent.

- que:
  - surprised to see me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - our connection.

- que:
  - and what reason is that?
  ans:
  - i killed you, mr. anderson.

- que:
  - what's happening to him?
  ans:
  - don't know.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - it was smith.

- que:
  - now there's more than one of them?
  ans:
  - a lot more.

- que:
  - how is that possible?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - ls that what he was doing to you?
  ans:
  - i don't know what he was doing...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it felt like i was back in that hallway.

- que:
  - are there two among you that would answer such a call?
  ans:
  - captain soren of the vigilant will answer the council's call.

- que:
  - you understand the situation, captain soren?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - is there another?
  ans:
  - captain, i think we should volunteer.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you have gone crazy.

- que:
  - is there no other?
  ans:
  - be hard for any man to risk his life...... especially if he doesn't understand the reason.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - thank you, captain niobe.

- que:
  - niobe, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - what i can.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because some things never change, jason...... and some things do.

- que:
  - what can you see, neo?
  ans:
  - it's strange.

- que:
  - encrypted?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - is that good for us or bad for us?
  ans:
  - well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - and the legendary morpheus.

- que:
  - drink?
  ans:
  - of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.

- que:
  - but then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
  ans:
  - chteau haut briond, 1959.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - it's like wiping your ass with silk.

- que:
  - the question is, do you know why you are here?
  ans:
  - we are looking for the keymaker.

- que:
  - ... what?
  ans:
  - you know the answer to that question.

- que:
  - but do you?
  ans:
  - you think you do, but you do not.

- que:
  - you can see it, neo, yes?
  ans:
  - she does not understand why.

- que:
  - is it the wine?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is the reason?
  ans:
  - and soon it does not matter.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - please, ma chrie, i have told you.

- que:
  - are you certain the oracle didn't say anything else?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - we are still alive.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - a kiss.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - i want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you love her.

- que:
  - why don't you sample this instead?
  ans:
  - trinity.

- que:
  - why should we trust you?
  ans:
  - if i don't deliver you to the keymaker, she can kill me.

- que:
  - aren't you, boys?
  ans:
  - yes, mistress.

- que:
  - how many people keep silver bullets in their gun?
  ans:
  - you betray me.

- que:
  - cause?
  ans:
  - there is no cause for this.

- que:
  - lipstick?
  ans:
  - lipstick.

- que:
  - i'll handle them.
  ans:
  - what craziness are you talking about, woman?

- que:
  - you'll handle us?
  ans:
  - you know, your predecessors had much more respect.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - ask jacinto to prepare the carriage.

- que:
  - bu why this public confession?
  ans:
  - i must settle my accounts with god and mankind.

- que:
  - as they say,
  ans:
  - what does your wife think about this?

- que:
  - it seems i'm disturbing you.
  ans:
  - so, how much are you charging me?

- que:
  - aren't you going to introduce me?
  ans:
  - i think i'm dreaming.

- que:
  - indifferent, eh?
  ans:
  - he is, it's what i said.

- que:
  - and when he came back, holding the man in his arms, whom do i see?
  ans:
  - jos silveira.

- que:
  - what paper was that you hid so quickly?
  ans:
  - my dear ivaro.

- que:
  - when you are less drunk.
  ans:
  - why were you at the newspaper?

- que:
  - and once he had no choice but to have him whipped.
  ans:
  - who's drunk?

- que:
  - if he were still alive, what wouldn't he do to you?
  ans:
  - you're drunker and more vulgar than any coachman.

- que:
  - and if we're found, jacinto?
  ans:
  - don't worry.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - to be a good daughter.

- que:
  - don't you want to go home, and forget this villain, who is the cause of our misfortunes?
  ans:
  - no, father.

- que:
  - not even here am i free from your hateful presence?
  ans:
  - i am one of the servants that my cousin takes with her.

- que:
  - who knows?
  ans:
  - maybe forever.

- que:
  - yes or no?
  ans:
  - you know it's true, master.

- que:
  - it's a big world and one can live anywhere.
  ans:
  - what would you say if i offered her hand to you?

- que:
  - what about my father?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid.

- que:
  - who is that with her?
  ans:
  - i think it's jacinto, master.

- que:
  - silvestre's coachman?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - you think so, or you are sure?
  ans:
  - it is him, master.

- que:
  - do you want the girl, or not?
  ans:
  - that's settled.

- que:
  - i knew you weren't a man to leave business unfinished.
  ans:
  - it's you groaning, master antnio?

- que:
  - can i have clara?
  ans:
  - hit him again and we'll see.

- que:
  - did you get him or not?
  ans:
  - jacinto.

- que:
  - who knows?
  ans:
  - you may have won her.

- que:
  - do you know why we killed him?
  ans:
  - i think you have lost her.

  ans:
  - madame d'argres did show up and spoiled everything.

- que:
  - who invited madame d'argres?
  ans:

  - yeah?
  ans:
  - well, wherever he is, i'll bet he's got legroom.

  ans:
  - then who's getting a nose ring?

- que:

- que:
  - did i miss something?
  ans:
  - i thought we saved the dock.

- que:
  - save the dock, captain?
  ans:
  - you handed it to them on a silver platter.

- que:
  - your move.
  ans:
  - do you hear that?

- que:
  - so you gave them your ship?
  ans:
  - that is correct, counciilor, i did.

- que:
  - the oracle said nothing of this?
  ans:
  - she told me neo would need my help, and i would choose to help him or not.

  - should we try to contact them?
  ans:
  - won't matter.

- que:

  ans:
  - vdts maybe.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - for neo.

- que:
  - how could he be in the matrix, sir?
  ans:
  - he's not plugged in.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - his neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - on someone jacked in.

  - who are you?
  ans:
  - my name is sati.

- que:
  - where am i?
  ans:
  - this is the train station.

- que:
  - this isn't the matrix?
  ans:
  - that's where the train goes.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - he won't let you.

- que:
  - who won't?
  ans:
  - the trainman.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i'm the oracle.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i made a choice, and that choice cost me more than i wanted it to.

- que:
  - what choice?
  ans:
  - to help you, to guide neo.

- que:
  - do you know what happened to neo?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because of who the trainman works for.

- que:
  - after everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you?
  ans:
  - i don't.

- que:
  - are you from the matrix?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why did you leave?
  ans:
  - i had to.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - you do not belong here.

- que:
  - who's the trainman?
  ans:
  - he works for the frenchman.

- que:
  - why did i know you would say that?
  ans:
  - the frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive.

- que:
  - you know him?
  ans:
  - i know only what i need to know.

- que:
  - is that what you're doing here?
  ans:
  - rama, please.

- que:
  - can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?
  ans:
  - it is already late.

- que:
  - you think it has something to do with me?
  ans:
  - i cannot say.

- que:
  - who knows such things?
  ans:
  - only the oracle.

- que:
  - you know the oracle?
  ans:
  - everyone knows the oracle.

- que:
  - you're not staying with her?
  ans:
  - it is not possible.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - that is our karma.

- que:
  - you believe in karma?
  ans:
  - karma is a word, like love.

- que:
  - can i carry that for you?
  ans:
  - he is a friend.

- que:
  - and if we're unlucky?
  ans:
  - there will be many men.

- que:
  - can i take your?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - what in the hell?
  ans:
  - i don't believe this.

- que:
  - tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but i don't think you have enough.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you what i will do.

- que:
  - all three of us?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, yes.

- que:
  - and since you, my little judas, have brought them here...... i can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
  ans:
  - disappointing, but not unexpected.

- que:
  - come now, what kind of question is this?
  ans:
  - of course i know.

- que:
  - do you know?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - i did not think so.

- que:
  - but it is always best to ask, huh?
  ans:
  - we want to make a deal.

- que:
  - always straight to business, huh, morpheus?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - to make a deal...... you must have something i want, yes?
  ans:
  - and it so happens there is something i want.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the eyes of the oracle.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - i don't have time for this shit.

- que:
  - how about this?
  ans:
  - you give me neo, or we all die, right here, right now.

- que:
  - you are really ready to die for this man?
  ans:
  - believe it.

- que:
  - what's it gonna be, merv?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - are you ready for us?
  ans:
  - almost, sir.

- que:
  - can't you see him?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - it's my last chance.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - cookies need love like everything does.

- que:
  - so do you recognize me?
  ans:
  - a part of you.

- que:
  - remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
  ans:
  - jittery as a june bug.

- que:
  - where does it end?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you don't know or you won't tell me?
  ans:
  - i told you before...... no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand, and i mean no one.

- que:
  - what choice?
  ans:
  - it doesn't matter.

- que:
  - does that include what things to tell me and what not to?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me the truth?
  ans:
  - because it wasn't time for you to know.

- que:
  - who decided it wasn't time?
  ans:
  - you know who.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - the source.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - he doesn't understand them.

- que:
  - what's your purpose?
  ans:
  - to unbalance it.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i want the same thing you want, neo.

- que:
  - is it going to end?
  ans:
  - one way or another.

- que:
  - can zion be saved?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i don't have the answer to that question, but....

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - you know where.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - everything that has a beginning...... has an end.

- que:
  - what is he?
  ans:
  - he is you.

- que:
  - and if i can't stop him?
  ans:
  - one way or another, neo...... this war is going to end.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - i need time.

- que:
  - what's up, maggie?
  ans:
  - bane is.

- que:
  - can i come back?
  ans:
  - i would like to come back.

- que:
  - what did she say about me?
  ans:
  - that you were a bad man.

- que:
  - i suppose you've been expecting me, right?
  ans:
  - the all knowing oracle is never surprised.

- que:
  - how can she be?
  ans:
  - she knows everything.

- que:
  - why wouldn't she leave?
  ans:
  - maybe you knew i would do that, maybe you didn't.

- que:
  - what did you do with sati?
  ans:
  - cookies need love like everything does.

- que:
  - what about the cuts on your arms?
  ans:
  - those cuts are more than one day old.

- que:
  - but why would i do something like that to myself?
  ans:
  - unless, of course, i wasn't myself.

- que:
  - has this man been tested for vdts?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - the logos?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - what about the ship?
  ans:
  - holographic says the hull's still intact.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - you can put that shit away, boys.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm fine.

- que:
  - did you get neo out?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how did you know about that?
  ans:
  - the oracle.

- que:
  - you saw her?
  ans:
  - just before the sentinels found us.

- que:
  - what did she tell you?
  ans:
  - the same thing she always does.

- que:
  - precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
  ans:
  - right now, the entire apu corps and half the infantry.

- que:
  - half the infantry?
  ans:
  - lf it were up to me, councillor...... i'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand...... and march them into that dock.

- que:
  - has there been word from the nebuchadnezzar?
  ans:
  - none, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be.

- que:
  - zee, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - making shells.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - they've called for volunteers to hold the dock.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i love him.

- que:
  - but ask yourself, if it were dozer...... and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock...... what would you do?
  ans:
  - make shells.

- que:
  - what the shit is going on over here?
  ans:
  - an accident, sir.

- que:
  - who the hell are you?
  ans:

  - then why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - i believe in him.

- que:

  - engine's still firing.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:

  - it's too dangerous.

- que:
  - why?

  - what?
  ans:
  - i think it's one of ours, sir.

- que:
  - would you like to see how i've treated it?
  ans:
  - i can hardly wait.

- que:
  - just what do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - oh, come now, watson.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - the fact is, i could barely hold my own... in the pit orchestra of a second rate music hall.

- que:
  - don't you think i'm aware you've been diluting it... behind my back?
  ans:
  - as a doctor, as well as your friend...

- que:
  - did you say midgets?
  ans:
  - mmm, six of them.

- que:
  - well, don't you find that intriguing?
  ans:
  - extremely so.

- que:
  - anarchists?

- que:
  - you really think so?
  ans:
  - there is something missing from my desk.

- que:
  - missing?
  ans:
  - something very crucial.

- que:
  - why don't you let me air the room out?
  ans:
  - please, mrs. hudson, he's working on... a definitive study of tobacco ash.

- que:
  - you do?
  ans:
  - it's placid, imperturbable, prosaic.

- que:
  - holmes... where's your self control?
  ans:
  - fair question.

- que:
  - aren't you ashamed of yourself?
  ans:
  - thoroughly... but this will take care of it.

- que:
  - why won't you go?
  ans:
  - it's the final performance of the lmperial russian ballet.

- que:
  - why should someone send us two free tickets?
  ans:
  - anonymously, at that.

  ans:
  - that's right.

  - any of your girls understand english?

- que:
  - short, tall, who cares?
  ans:
  - it is the brains that count.

  ans:
  - oh, it's magnificent.

  ans:
  - for services you will render.

  - because without father, how could there be child?
  ans:
  - red pepper.

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - madame would like to know when you can be ready.

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - to leave for venice.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - we don't know.

- que:
  - because tchaikovsky how shall i put it?
  ans:
  - women... not his glass of tea.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - you know what they say about us.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - we're all bleeders.

- que:
  - you find her attractive or no?
  ans:
  - well, i...

- que:
  - i am?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - you find madame attractive or no?
  ans:
  - oh, i find her most attractive... for a woman, that is.

- que:
  - not free?
  ans:
  - but you are bachelor.

- que:
  - you mean you and dr. watson...
  ans:
  - what is it you are trying to tell us?

- que:
  - he... is your glass of tea?
  ans:
  - lf you want to be picturesque about it.

- que:
  - ... tchaikovsky?
  ans:
  - believe me, madame, the loss is all mine.

- que:
  - what is it, old boy?
  ans:
  - we're going home.

- que:
  - home?
  ans:
  - not a chance.

- que:
  - what way?
  ans:
  - oh, you don't have to pretend.

- que:
  - about me and him?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - what is?
  ans:
  - from the sound of your footsteps...

- que:
  - what the deuce were you thinking of?
  ans:
  - watson, you have my most abject apologies.

- que:
  - but have you ever been cornered by a madwoman?
  ans:
  - it seemed like the only way to get out of it... without hurting her feelings.

- que:
  - you realize the gravity of what you've done... the possible repercussions?
  ans:
  - so there'll be a little gossip about you... in st. petersburg.

- que:
  - what am i to do?
  ans:
  - well, for one thing, i'd get rid of that flower.

- que:
  - can you, holmes?
  ans:
  - good night, watson.

- que:
  - i hope i'm not being presumptuous... but there have been women in your life?
  ans:
  - the answer is yes... you're being presumptuous.

- que:
  - was there some secret he was holding back... or was he just a thinking machine... incapable of any emotion?
  ans:
  - i was not to get the answer... until we became involved in what i considered to be... the most outrageous case in all our years together.

- que:
  - were you expecting someone?
  ans:
  - not at this hour.

- que:
  - what is it, mrs. hudson?
  ans:
  - there's a cabby here, says you owe him two and six.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - for the fare, governor.

- que:
  - what young lady?
  ans:
  - this one.

- que:
  - what happened to you?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - where did she come from?
  ans:
  - from the river.

- que:
  - why did you bring her here?
  ans:
  - because i found this in her hand.

- que:
  - young lady, what did you want at this address?
  ans:
  - i do not remember.

- que:
  - rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?
  ans:
  - rather.

- que:
  - or shall i throw her back in the river?
  ans:
  - oh, mr. holmes, you can't let him do that.

- que:
  - could she have hit her head when she fell... or jumped into the river?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i'm dr. watson... and this is sherlock holmes.

- que:
  - do the names mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - can you think of your own name?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - namely?
  ans:
  - something i deduced... when i was helping her up the stairs.

- que:
  - vous etes francaise?
  ans:
  - non.

- que:
  - vous etes suisse?
  ans:
  - non.

- que:
  - alors, vous etes belge?
  ans:
  - je ne suis pas sur.

- que:
  - vous etes belge, de bruxelles?
  ans:
  - we just found out she's belgian.

- que:
  - gabrielle?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - and your husband's name is emile?
  ans:
  - emile.

- que:
  - what are you doing in london?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - there's already been one attempt on her life.
  ans:
  - when did you arrive from brussels?

- que:
  - this temporary amnesia, how temporary is it?
  ans:
  - it depends on the extent of her injury.

- que:
  - don't you find that challenging?
  ans:
  - quite... but we can't afford to wait for these veils to lift.

- que:
  - you really feel it's that urgent?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - emile?
  ans:
  - emile.

- que:
  - ls that you, emile?
  ans:
  - yes, gabrielle.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i hope you're not going to be angry with me.

- que:
  - did you?
  ans:
  - a pink negligee with marabou feathers.

- que:
  - don't you think it's a little bit foolish... for a married woman?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - where is the negligee?
  ans:
  - ln my luggage.

- que:
  - and where is your luggage?
  ans:
  - oh, i don't know.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - dr. watson.

- que:
  - mrs. hudson, would you mind... planting your knee in the small of my back?
  ans:
  - yes, i would.

- que:
  - as a matter of fact, i did take advantage of her.
  ans:
  - gone?

- que:
  - would you hand me the butter knife, please?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - you did what?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - have you no sense of decency, no shame?
  ans:
  - none whatsoever.

- que:
  - remember that piece of soggy cardboard... with our address on it?
  ans:
  - it was a luggage ticket.

- que:
  - what else is in here?
  ans:
  - now we're getting somewhere.

- que:
  - who do you suppose this is?
  ans:

- que:
  - ashdown street what was that number?
  ans:
  - thirty two.

- que:
  - what do you want me to say in the letter?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - holmes... you're sending an empty sheet of paper... to an empty shop?
  ans:
  - that empty shop is obviously being used... as an accommodation address or letter drop.

- que:
  - the question is how and by whom... and why?
  ans:
  - hammer.

- que:
  - suppose this could've been a pet shop?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - mr. holmes?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - what does it mean?
  ans:
  - i would surmise somebody was using ice skates... if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.

- que:
  - what do we do now?
  ans:
  - this way.

- que:
  - you think i'd forgotten you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - taking dancing lessons.

- que:
  - how many do you want this time?
  ans:
  - two dozen.

- que:
  - what's going on up there?
  ans:

- que:
  - does that go, too?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - right, you got it?
  ans:
  - wait.

- que:
  - and where is up there?
  ans:
  - my guess would be scotland...

- que:
  - didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage?
  ans:
  - the lnverness courier.

- que:
  - what about it?
  ans:
  - it is addressed to you.

  - but that's impossible.

- que:
  - what time do you make it, watson?
  ans:
  - 11:43.

- que:
  - how's your gout?
  ans:
  - under control, except for an occasional twinge.

  - i see you so rarely.

- que:
  - how long has it been?
  ans:
  - not since the, uh, case of the greek interpreter.

  - two brothers, living in the same town.

- que:

  ans:
  - why, it's...

- que:
  - it's in belgium, isn't it?
  ans:
  - quite.

  - the diogenes club, of course.

- que:
  - yes, wiggins?
  ans:

  ans:
  - my dear sherlock, there are certain affairs... that do not come within the province... of the private detective.

- que:
  - by whose authority?
  ans:
  - by the authority of her majesty's government.

- que:
  - watson, what does the word glennahurich... suggest to you?
  ans:
  - absolutely nothing.

- que:
  - ls it?
  ans:
  - open that door.

- que:
  - did you ever try doing embroidery... with a gun in your hand?
  ans:
  - you'll be relieved to know it was not loaded.

- que:
  - holmes, are you planning to disobey mycroft's orders?
  ans:
  - he's not just your brother, you know.

- que:
  - did you find out anything?
  ans:
  - let's just say i know what the next step will be.

  - i want you to pack your things.

- que:
  - at 7:30 this evening, dr. watson and i... are going to take you to victoria station... and put you on the boat train.

- que:
  - the boat train?
  ans:

  - you don't like me very much, do you?
  ans:
  - nothing of the sort.

- que:
  - looking for something?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - am i embarrassing you, mr. holmes?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - oh?
  ans:
  - a very interesting case in a harem in constantinople.

- que:
  - going to scotland, you gentlemen?
  ans:
  - so are we.

- que:
  - ever been there?
  ans:
  - beautiful country.

- que:
  - you must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence?
  ans:
  - trappists, i think you're called.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - i didn't say it.

- que:
  - oh?
  ans:
  - it was one of those passionate affairs... at odd hours right in my laboratory.

- que:
  - your... fiancee?
  ans:
  - she was the daughter of my violin teacher.

- que:
  - how far is it?
  ans:
  - glennahurich...

- que:
  - why do you want to go there?
  ans:
  - well, it sounds like a nice, peaceful place... for a picnic.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i would think so.

- que:
  - working you hard, dad?
  ans:
  - no, not really.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - an accident, aye.

- que:
  - local people?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - what do you believe?
  ans:
  - well, you may think i'm an old fool... an old drunk, but...

- que:
  - are you trying to tell us it was the monster?
  ans:
  - damn right.

- que:
  - ls it?
  ans:
  - last easter sunday, the wife and me... on our way to services, when suddenly...

- que:
  - ah, what's the use?
  ans:
  - here you are, dad.

- que:
  - lf they're unidentified graves... why are those boys bringing flowers?
  ans:
  - because it's their brothers who have just been buried.

- que:
  - their brothers?
  ans:
  - and they're not boys.

- que:
  - pebbles?
  ans:
  - take a look at their faces.

- que:
  - they are... how do you call them in english?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - do you remember a tumbling act six brothers missing from the circus?
  ans:
  - that case you turned down.

- que:
  - hand me that lantern.
  ans:
  - the question now is, who's in the third grave?

- que:
  - it is valladon, isn't it?
  ans:
  - obviously... but what is not so obvious... is why his wedding ring has turned green... and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin.

- que:
  - may i have your wedding ring, please?
  ans:
  - the monster.

- que:
  - there, there.
  ans:
  - the monster?

- que:
  - see it?
  ans:
  - there.

- que:
  - see it?
  ans:
  - i see nothing.

- que:
  - nothing?
  ans:
  - it's gone.

- que:
  - gone?
  ans:
  - maybe it was never there.

- que:
  - asphyxiation?
  ans:
  - there's only one substance... that can turn a copper ring green... and bleach the color out of canaries chlorine gas.

- que:
  - you call yourself logical?
  ans:
  - you're the least logical man i know.

- que:
  - am l?
  ans:
  - how can you say it's a figment of my imagination... when for years you've been saying...

- que:
  - would you like some more cranberry sauce, dear?
  ans:
  - yes, dear.

- que:
  - would you pass the cranberry sauce, john?
  ans:
  - there's some chaps i met on the train.

- que:
  - trappists, you know?
  ans:
  - just study their bibles.

- que:
  - lsn't that odd?
  ans:
  - quite.

- que:
  - it's just a pile of rubble.
  ans:
  - what is it, dear?

- que:
  - why, indeed?
  ans:
  - let's go.

- que:
  - go where?
  ans:
  - when rebuffed at the front door... one's only choice is to try the tradesman's entrance.

- que:
  - are you the guide here?
  ans:
  - yes, but the castle is closed to the public... while work is going on.

- que:
  - oh, what are they doing?
  ans:
  - it's being restored by the society... for the preservation of scottish monuments.

- que:
  - about 1400, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - let me see, was it built by james ll or james ill?
  ans:
  - the ill, but if you'd like to come back next year... we'll be finished then... and i'll be glad to show you around.

- que:
  - pleasant sort, isn't he?
  ans:
  - pleasant, but ignorant.

- que:
  - lf he's an official guide, shouldn't he know?
  ans:
  - lf he's an official guide.

- que:
  - listen, do you hear anything, watson?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - like that?
  ans:
  - no, like that.

- que:
  - planning to spend the night out here?
  ans:
  - lf necessary.

- que:
  - do you have your stethoscope with you?
  ans:
  - never without it.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i lost my parasol.

- que:
  - yes, i know.
  ans:
  - where's watson?

- que:
  - but would you believe you can't borrow... a decent pair of trousers in this place?
  ans:
  - all right, holmes.

- que:
  - want to confide in us?
  ans:
  - whenever he starts whistling...

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - at the ballet.

- que:
  - an engine?
  ans:
  - the stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument... and water is an excellent conductor of sound.

- que:
  - you think my husband was involved in all this?
  ans:
  - yes, madame valladon, i'm sure of it.

- que:
  - just to scare people?
  ans:
  - not very likely.

- que:
  - those are my instructions.
  ans:
  - why did they try to keep me from finding my husband?

- que:
  - deliver it where?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't know, sir... but there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs.

- que:
  - are you sure you've got the right mr. ashdown?
  ans:
  - quite sure, mr. holmes.

- que:
  - well... who's minding the castle?
  ans:
  - you'd better get on.

- que:
  - some sort of party?
  ans:
  - you won't be disappointed in the guest list.

- que:
  - who's the host?
  ans:
  - jonah.

- que:
  - mr. ashdown, i presume?
  ans:
  - the red runner, i presume.

- que:
  - may i have the champagne, please?

- que:
  - tie it up, will you?
  ans:
  - ln here.

- que:
  - or... think you know?

- que:
  - and madame valladon... what part did she play in all of this?

  ans:
  - you were supposed to dump her in the river...

- que:
  - will that make you happy?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - do you realize we spent an entire year... following soneji's every move?
  ans:
  - i think we deserve these.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - profiling the profiler.

- que:
  - you really believe that he shot soneji to save my life?
  ans:
  - cross pulled the trigger because he knew soneji didn't have megan.

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - i'm saying that sooner or later.

- que:
  - isn't he?
  ans:
  - no.

  ans:
  - i wish to help you all i can, inspector.

- que:
  - why did you press it twice?
  ans:
  - oh, it was only once.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - perhaps you will wait, madame.

- que:

  - you're very attached to both of them, aren't you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - inspector, what does all this mean?
  ans:
  - i've no idea.

- que:
  - and why involve your wife?
  ans:
  - and she was there.

- que:
  - how does one tell a child?
  ans:
  - well, if i may suggest, you could look after the boy for a while.

- que:
  - what's going to happen to her?
  ans:
  - we'll keep her under observation.

- que:
  - did your brother ever experiment with animals?
  ans:

- que:
  - they think i'm mad, don't they?
  ans:
  - oh, there.

- que:
  - it's obvious, isn't it?
  ans:
  - in spite of what the doctors think, i believe mrs delambre's mind is quite clear.

- que:
  - how can you say that?
  ans:
  - she must be mad.

- que:
  - what about philippe?
  ans:
  - she acts as if the boy were mine and not hers.

- que:
  - you're in love with her, aren't you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why didn't you marry her?
  ans:
  - because she loved my brother.

- que:
  - why should i do such a thing?
  ans:
  - motive one, for his wife.

- que:
  - what do i care about motives?
  ans:
  - hlne is in trouble and andr's dead.

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - she's very sick, isn't she?
  ans:
  - yes, philippe, she's very sick.

- que:
  - do flies live a long time?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i saw that fly mummy was looking for again.

- que:
  - how did you recognise it, philippe?
  ans:
  - its head is white instead of black and it has a funny sort of leg.

- que:
  - oh?
  ans:
  - i didn't notice it.

- que:
  - when did you first see that fly, philippe?
  ans:
  - the day daddy went away.

- que:
  - how is she now?
  ans:
  - resting quietly, poor lady.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - how long do flies live?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - did you kill it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is this all about?
  ans:
  - you haven't got it or you wouldn't ask.

- que:
  - you swear you have it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - if i tell you, will you promise to destroy it?
  ans:
  - i can't do that until i know.

- que:
  - don't you see?
  ans:
  - i was pretending to be mad, for philippe's sake.

- que:
  - if i tell you, will you tell them?
  ans:
  - i only want to help you.

- que:
  - you promise?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - hi, daddy.
  ans:
  - who's a ticklish boy?

- que:
  - are you gonna play with us?
  ans:
  - later, philippe.

- que:
  - promise?
  ans:
  - promise.

- que:
  - not the portable reactor?
  ans:
  - i'll show you.

- que:
  - remember this?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - have you turned magician?
  ans:
  - but it is true.

- que:
  - what happens?
  ans:
  - a stream of electrons sound and picture impulses are transmitted through the air.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - well, because it's impossible.

- que:
  - it's no trick?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - well, it doesn't matter, does it, andr?
  ans:
  - there we are.

- que:
  - the ballet?
  ans:
  - and we'll eat at tour d'eiffel.

- que:
  - finish?
  ans:
  - well, not quite.

- que:
  - well, what do you suggest?
  ans:
  - you're in an unscientific mood.

- que:
  - you don't approve?
  ans:
  - i didn't say that.

- que:
  - will the champagne be as good as ever?
  ans:
  - exactly the same, bubble for bubble.

- que:
  - may i look after him?
  ans:
  - it's still a her.

- que:
  - it's a little frightening, isn't it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - well, where's she gone?
  ans:
  - into space.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - oh, just looking at the sky.

- que:
  - so aware of the infinite?
  ans:
  - the more i know, the more sure i am i know so little.

- que:
  - how do you mean?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - would you marry me again if you had your time over?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - shall i call professor augier and the air ministry?
  ans:
  - no.

  - what's all the celebration about?
  ans:

- que:
  - flat screen?
  ans:
  - coming, philippe.

- que:
  - yes, darling?
  ans:
  - i got something to show you.

- que:

  ans:
  - you know how your father disapproves of you catching insects.

- que:
  - anything else, madame?
  ans:
  - no, thank you, emma.

- que:
  - shall i leave something for the master?
  ans:
  - he didn't touch a bite of his dinner.

- que:
  - andr?
  ans:
  - andr, i'm going to bed now.

- que:
  - is there anything you want?
  ans:
  - andr.

- que:
  - andr, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - answer me.

- que:
  - anything i can do, madame?
  ans:
  - no, i can manage.

- que:
  - do you understand?
  ans:
  - we'll find the fly tomorrow, i promise.

- que:
  - now why don't you go to bed?
  ans:
  - i'll help you.

- que:
  - do you need anything tonight?
  ans:
  - darling, please try and get some sleep.

- que:
  - remember the ashtray?
  ans:
  - i've had a similar accident.

- que:
  - can i come back in?
  ans:
  - don't worry, andr.

- que:
  - flies, madame?
  ans:
  - yes.

  - are you sure you caught it?
  ans:
  - oh, the white one.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - oh, it's no good, emma.

- que:
  - make some supper, emma, would you?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - andr?
  ans:
  - we caught the fly today, but it escaped out into the garden.

- que:
  - why won't you wait?
  ans:
  - then see augier and the other scientists.

- que:
  - remember the ashtray experiment?
  ans:
  - go through again.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - please try it.

- que:
  - it has worked, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - you'll be all right now.

- que:
  - where are his notes?
  ans:
  - he destroyed them.

- que:
  - and the writing on the blackboard?
  ans:
  - i rubbed it out.

- que:
  - a fly headed human?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you believe the story?
  ans:
  - well, it explains all the facts.

- que:
  - how's the mistress, sir?
  ans:
  - as well as can be expected.

- que:
  - emma, when you had that mad search for a fly, did you see it?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - what did it look like?
  ans:
  - oh, just a fly.

- que:
  - but did it look any different?
  ans:
  - not to me it didn't.

- que:
  - some coffee?
  ans:
  - no, thank you.

- que:

  ans:
  - as next of kin you have the right.

- que:
  - madame?
  ans:
  - time to get up now.

- que:
  - is it a nice day?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you didn't destroy it?
  ans:
  - inspector, you saw it.

- que:
  - you never had it?
  ans:
  - if you'll just come with us, madame.

- que:
  - you never saw it?
  ans:
  - leave her alone.

- que:
  - is the ambulance for mummy?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is she going to be all right?
  ans:
  - yes.

  - when's daddy coming home then?
  ans:
  - soon, philippe.

  - which show will we go to?
  ans:
  - any...

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - it's in a web.

- que:
  - you're sure?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - you saw it, didn't you?
  ans:
  - yes, i saw it.

- que:
  - but who's going to believe us?
  ans:
  - they'll think we're both mad.

- que:
  - you taking me to the zoo?
  ans:
  - yes, if your mother doesn't...

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - mummy told me about daddy.

- que:
  - why did he die?
  ans:
  - well, philippe, he died because of his work.

- que:
  - that's what killed him?
  ans:
  - search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world.

- que:
  - will you help me, uncle franois?
  ans:
  - yes, philippe.

- que:
  - did i miss the port in?
  ans:
  - just the first wave.

  ans:
  - i brought my game pod.

- que:
  - you think two hours, tops?
  ans:
  - well, two, three hours.

- que:
  - so you're saying three hours?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - are you ready, allegra?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - no matter what happens, okay?
  ans:
  - we have enemies in our own house.

- que:
  - do you know any country people?
  ans:
  - you're labelled.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - that was our lifeline to civilization.

- que:
  - you mean head office?
  ans:
  - anybody.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're not armed.

- que:
  - who told you that?
  ans:
  - i'm a marketing trainee.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - so we can have an intimate moment together.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - what i just dug out of you.

- que:
  - where were you just now?
  ans:
  - i was wandering through existenz.

- que:
  - why won't you let me contact antenna?
  ans:
  - they've gotta be going crazy wondering what's happened to you.

- que:
  - we just ran because we didn't know how many of them there were, right?
  ans:
  - don't tell me you've never been fitted.

- que:
  - you've never played any game?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - or are you not?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - anything else i can do for you?
  ans:
  - well, gas...... you could check your bio port plugs.

- que:
  - spark plugs?
  ans:
  - you heard me.

- que:
  - now...... that's a sort of hole in your spine, isn't it?
  ans:
  - lots of assholes around here, but that's generally it.

- que:
  - before?
  ans:
  - before it was changed by allegra geller.

- que:
  - did you ever play her game artgod?
  ans:
  - one word.

- que:
  - those are sterilized...... aren't they?
  ans:
  - not to worry.

- que:
  - then why the clean overalls?
  ans:
  - it's a mental thing.

- que:
  - god?
  ans:
  - the mechanic.

- que:
  - that didn't hurt, did it?
  ans:
  - i didn't expect that to hurt.

- que:
  - how many have you done?
  ans:
  - three.

- que:
  - what was going on, gas?
  ans:
  - hell...... he's acting like i'm attacking him.

- que:
  - great.
  ans:
  - yeah?

- que:
  - we don't have to wait for the swelling to go down.
  ans:
  - what's going on?

- que:
  - you wanted to play my game, didn't you?
  ans:
  - feels...... cold.

- que:
  - how come...... bio ports don't get infected?
  ans:
  - i mean...... they open right into your body.

- que:
  - don't you think you could call me ted?
  ans:
  - maybe afterwards.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i jacked you into my pod and you panicked.

- que:
  - that's the only version that exists?
  ans:
  - it's the only one and it's stuck inside...... and it's your fault.

- que:
  - why is it my fault?
  ans:
  - i'm telling you, i didn't.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - you're worth a lot of money if you're dead.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you know what i'm talking about.

- que:
  - why did you install a bad port into me?
  ans:
  - there's a bonus for killing...... allegra geller's latest game, or whatever it is.

- que:
  - i mean, don't you ever go to the fucking movies?
  ans:
  - i like your script.

- que:
  - we're going skiing?
  ans:
  - look at that huge bug.

- que:
  - what happens if somebody comes up here and really wants to ski?
  ans:
  - nobody actually physically skis anymore.

- que:
  - are you in danger?
  ans:
  - there have been a couple of attempts on my life.

- que:
  - what did you port into?
  ans:
  - pikul's bio port.

- que:
  - that's what caused all the damage?
  ans:
  - it was a flawed installation.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - looks like an animal in there.

- que:
  - where do the batteries go?
  ans:
  - very funny.

- que:
  - you're telling me this thing will run off my body's energy?
  ans:
  - that's how they work.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - you're humming along already.

- que:
  - you want that one?
  ans:
  - yeah, that one.

- que:
  - are you sure you want that one?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - the graphics on this one are better.

- que:
  - that one?
  ans:
  - that was beautiful.

- que:
  - that kind of smooth interlacing from place to place?
  ans:
  - depends on the style of the game.

- que:
  - what precisely is the goal of the game that we're playing now?
  ans:
  - you have to play the game to find out why you're playing the game.

- que:
  - ever see anything like this before?
  ans:
  - these are delicate.

- que:
  - will it work with an industry standard bio port?
  ans:
  - i'm d'arcy nader.

- que:
  - is there anything i can be helping you with?
  ans:
  - we're just looking.

- que:
  - who sent you?
  ans:
  - it's none of your business who sent us.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i didn't mean to say that.

- que:
  - it's a kind of schizophrenic feeling, isn't it?
  ans:
  - you'll get used to it.

- que:
  - but should you be saying this in front of him?
  ans:
  - look at him.

- que:
  - what's he doing?
  ans:
  - he's gone into a game loop.

- que:
  - we do, don't we?
  ans:
  - i assumed we did.

- que:
  - nader?
  ans:
  - he's not a very well drawn character.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - the whole pod just disappeared into your back.

- que:
  - it's working its way round my spinal cord?
  ans:
  - don't panic.

- que:
  - do you feel anything yet?
  ans:
  - no, i don't.

- que:
  - what the hell was that?
  ans:
  - that wasn't me.

- que:
  - do you feel yours yet?
  ans:
  - they'll take care of themselves.

- que:
  - what if there's danger?
  ans:
  - they're just where we left them.

- que:
  - i'm very new.
  ans:
  - trying to remember who you are?

- que:

- que:
  - aren't you dying to see what's so special about the special?
  ans:
  - i'm feeling a little disconnected from my real life.

- que:

  ans:

- que:

  ans:
  - it was very...... revealing.

- que:
  - why did the chinese waiter have to die?
  ans:
  - a waiter hears...... many things spoken when people are relaxing and eating.

- que:
  - he betrayed you?
  ans:
  - he betrayed us.

- que:
  - is this where you caught today's special?
  ans:
  - we originally were raising these mutant creatures...... for their nervous systems for game pods.

- que:
  - it's owned by cortical systematics?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  - hugo carlaw, is d'arcy nader here?
  ans:
  - he's in the back.

  ans:
  - my assembly bay.

- que:
  - you didn't like that, so you killed him?
  ans:
  - he's only a game character.

- que:
  - what if we're not in the game anymore?
  ans:

- que:
  - well, isn't that up to her?
  ans:
  - she doesn't really know who i am.

- que:
  - how was your journey?
  ans:
  - many machines on lx.

- que:
  - oh?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why would they want the duke's son killed?
  ans:
  - we must have a look at paul atreides, on caladan.

- que:
  - music, then?
  ans:
  - no music.

- que:
  - what's wrong with gurney?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - the harkonnens are real.
  ans:
  - would you really have drawn my blood?

- que:
  - dr. yueh, do you have any information on the worms of arrakis?
  ans:
  - i have obtained a filmbook of a small specimen.

- que:
  - only?
  ans:
  - there have been documented sightings... of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert.

- que:
  - how do the fremen survive there?
  ans:
  - we don't know much about the fremen.

- que:
  - could the spice affect us in other ways?
  ans:
  - many dangers exist on arrakis.

- que:
  - but if it is a trap, then why are we going?
  ans:
  - we have our new army.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - something for your father.

- que:
  - you thought only of a duke's desire for a son?
  ans:
  - desires don't come into this.

- que:
  - how dare you?
  ans:
  - my greatest student.

- que:
  - what about my father?
  ans:
  - put your right hand in the box.

- que:
  - what's in the box?
  ans:
  - pain.

- que:
  - are you suggesting a duke's son is an animal?
  ans:
  - let us say i suggest you may be human.

- que:
  - could he be the one?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - but will he be ours to control?
  ans:
  - tell me of your home world, usul.

- que:
  - the bile from the newborn worms of arrakis?
  ans:
  - i have heard of it.

- que:
  - they tried and failed?
  ans:
  - they tried and died.

- que:
  - what about my father?
  ans:
  - i heard your talking.

- que:
  - what does leto say, piter?
  ans:
  - i won't tell you who the traitor is... or when we'll attack.

- que:
  - what have you discovered about the fremen, duncan?
  ans:
  - tell me.

- que:
  - why haven't we heard from you?
  ans:
  - my lord, i suspect so much.

- que:
  - why is the shield not yet up?
  ans:
  - sir, we found and removed another sabotage device.

- que:
  - are you a fremen?
  ans:
  - i've been on arrakis... in the service of the emperor long enough for my eyes to change.

- que:
  - will you give us an explanation of their workings?
  ans:
  - well, this is a stillsuit of fremen manufacture, the most efficient type on arrakis.

- que:
  - who told you how to do that?
  ans:
  - no one.

- que:
  - battle language?
  ans:
  - translate it.

- que:
  - will we see a worm?
  ans:
  - where there's spice and spice mining, there are always worms.

- que:
  - why do they come?
  ans:
  - to protect their territory.

- que:
  - is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
  ans:
  - as i said, they defend the spice sand.

- que:
  - as to their relationship with the spice, who knows?
  ans:
  - my message.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm fine.

- que:
  - is it wormsign?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - may i?
  ans:
  - calling harvester pad nine.

- que:
  - who calls pad nine?
  ans:
  - don't mention the duke.

- que:
  - what happens now?
  ans:
  - the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester.

- que:
  - ordered by whom?
  ans:
  - duke leto atreides.

- que:
  - how many men do you have?
  ans:
  - full crew, 26 men.

- que:
  - what's that you're saying?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - where is your son?
  ans:

  ans:
  - it has to be someone in the palace.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am the shadout mapes, the housekeeper.

- que:
  - jessica, what is wrong?
  ans:
  - forgive me, my beloved concubine.

- que:
  - why hold a dream to ascend to a throne through a political marriage?
  ans:
  - i should have married you.

- que:
  - i've brought house atreides down.
  ans:
  - what happened?

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i wish to kill a man.

- que:
  - leto, where are you?
  ans:
  - how simple to subdue us.

- que:
  - what are your orders, piter?
  ans:
  - join her.

- que:
  - you think i don't know what i gained... for my wife?
  ans:
  - take him away.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i didn't hear anything.

- que:
  - where is the ducal signet ring?
  ans:
  - i must have his ring.

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - paul and jessica safe.

- que:
  - you do not answer?
  ans:
  - come closer, baron.

- que:
  - i'm alive?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - maybe that small rock.
  ans:
  - i'm alive, eh?

- que:
  - where are we, do you think?
  ans:
  - the south polar regions.

- que:
  - where are my feelings?
  ans:
  - i feel for no one.

- que:
  - why do they want me killed?
  ans:
  - it has to be something to do with the spice.

- que:
  - well, i've just had a waking dream.
  ans:
  - but what?

- que:
  - ls he the one?
  ans:
  - you carry my unborn sister in your womb.

- que:
  - why did it leave?
  ans:
  - someone started another thumper.

- que:
  - what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
  ans:
  - we call that one muad'dib.

- que:
  - could i be known as paul muad'dib?
  ans:
  - you are paul muad'dib.

- que:
  - where's my doctor?
  ans:
  - jessica... our reverend mother is too old.

- que:
  - but what of my unborn child?
  ans:
  - one day, i will have to do this.

- que:
  - am i the one?
  ans:
  - the sleeper must awaken.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - muad'dib.

- que:
  - what happened to you and your men?
  ans:
  - muad'dib.

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - muad'dib.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he's been repeating that name ever since we found him.

- que:
  - you've no need of your weapons with me, gurney halleck.
  ans:
  - muad'dib?

- que:
  - don't you trust your own eyes?
  ans:
  - that's our entire reserves as well.

- que:
  - they tried and failed?
  ans:
  - they tried and died.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - alia.

- que:
  - stilgar, do we have wormsign?
  ans:
  - usul, we have wormsign the likes of which even god has never seen.

- que:
  - why have you brought me here?
  ans:
  - your highness... there must be some mistake.

- que:
  - paul is muad'dib?
  ans:
  - alia keeps pace with the storm.

- que:
  - the righteous?
  ans:
  - there is a harkonnen among you.

- que:
  - will she deserve my special attentions?
  ans:
  - poisoned.

- que:
  - think of this as a new adventure, the adventure of a lifetime.
  ans:
  - and how can this be?

- que:
  - leaving our home for some dry speck of dust in the middle of nowhere?
  ans:
  - you're a duke's son.

- que:
  - how could i ever forget?
  ans:
  - every day i have to eat responsibility for breakfast and duty for dinner.

- que:
  - why are you afraid of her mother?
  ans:
  - pitch of your voice gives you away.

- que:
  - since when is it permitted to treat the lady jessica as a common servant?
  ans:
  - she was a common servant.

- que:
  - which men?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you lie.... what else?
  ans:
  - sometimes i see strange people worshiping water... and saying a strange name... my name i think.

- que:
  - and do you know this girl?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you know what this is?
  ans:
  - it is a test, young atreides.

- que:
  - a test for what?
  ans:
  - put your hand inside and we'll see.

- que:
  - what's in it?
  ans:
  - pain.

- que:
  - not in the mood?
  ans:
  - mood is a thing for cattle and women, young pup.

- que:
  - they used to be human, didn't they?
  ans:
  - until the spice changed them.

- que:
  - will arrakis be as bad as they say, thufir?
  ans:
  - the storms, perhaps.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - that remains my little secret for now.

- que:
  - what about the other great houses?
  ans:
  - they're sure to protest.

- que:
  - should i, er, persuade some to stay?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - the fremen?
  ans:
  - in the deep desert.

- que:
  - what's he doing?
  ans:
  - water seller, milady.

- que:
  - what's wrong with their eyes?
  ans:
  - those are fremen, desert people.

- que:
  - what is this for?
  ans:
  - an old custom, i'm told.

- que:
  - can i see him?
  ans:
  - i have him occupied on official business for the moment.

- que:
  - right now?
  ans:
  - it's time you participate it.

- que:
  - your name, shadout, it means well dipper, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - i was raised in the desert sietches, noble born.

- que:
  - there is no wife?
  ans:
  - i'm his only companion, the mother of his son.

- que:
  - you are bene gesserit?
  ans:
  - yes, i know the ancient tongues.

- que:
  - could it be possible that she brings the mahdi?
  ans:
  - the thing must take its course.

- que:
  - what about the mining accounts?
  ans:
  - the harkonnen spice operation took...... 10 billion solaris out of here every year.

- que:
  - now, does anyone here still think that the harkonnen have just packed up and left?
  ans:
  - gurney, i want you to make contact...... with the smugglers operating in the deep desert.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i would just love to see the baron's face when he hears of this.

- que:
  - worthy to be your first born?
  ans:
  - they tell me her ambitions tend more to the literary than the political.

- que:
  - why did we come here, father?
  ans:
  - and don't just tell me it's a matter of honor or duty.

- que:
  - there's more to it, isn't there?
  ans:
  - i've never lied to you, son.

- que:
  - then why don't we call them out?
  ans:
  - expose them...... in front of the emperor.

- que:
  - what if he's one of them?
  ans:
  - this is a hard lesson, son.

- que:
  - one of yours, turok?
  ans:
  - harkonnen mercenaries.

- que:
  - are they trustworthy?
  ans:
  - they are fremen.

- que:
  - why don't we use shields?
  ans:
  - shields are useless in the desert.

- que:
  - you've worn a stillsuit before?
  ans:
  - this is the first time.

- que:
  - someone adjusted it for you?
  ans:
  - no, it just seemed the right way to put it on, that's all.

- que:
  - how many men are there on a mining crew?
  ans:
  - as few as possible.

- que:
  - has anyone ever been lost out this far and survived?
  ans:
  - men have walked out of the nearer zones by crossing the rock areas...... where worms seldom go.

- que:
  - fremen?
  ans:
  - fremen.

- que:
  - and those are the scouts?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - worm sign?
  ans:
  - wherever there is spice, there are worms.

- que:
  - always?
  ans:
  - they defend the spice sands.

- que:
  - has there been an effort to wipe them out?
  ans:
  - too much area to cover.

- que:
  - where's the carryall to evacuate the harvester?
  ans:
  - worm sign, approximately 40 kilometers.

- que:
  - do they always cut it this close?
  ans:
  - it's not standard procedure.

- que:
  - how many men on that harvester?
  ans:
  - usually 23, milord.

- que:
  - are we sure the worm will attack?
  ans:
  - no doubt about it.

- que:
  - why aren't they coming out?
  ans:
  - they are hoping that the carryall will show up at the last minute.

- que:
  - may he keep the world for his people.
  ans:
  - what are they doing?

- que:
  - how about the men we left behind?
  ans:
  - send a ship to search for them.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - paul.

- que:
  - and what do you deduce from all of this, nephew?
  ans:
  - the longer we wait, the harder it will be to dislodge him.

- que:
  - piter, try again, will you?
  ans:
  - leto's continued success makes the other great houses nervous, rabban.

- que:
  - the slave is quite a specimen this time, don't you think, rabban?
  ans:
  - perhaps feyd shouldn't be quite so casual today.

- que:
  - paul?
  ans:
  - these are, uh, simple people, milord.

- que:
  - tell me...... do the cooks use much spice in our food?
  ans:
  - the spice is everywhere on arrakis, milord.

- que:
  - i was its target?
  ans:
  - it goes toward movement, that's all.

- que:
  - iniative?
  ans:
  - you decided to show some initiative.

- que:
  - now what, piter?
  ans:
  - there is, of course, the slight troop transport problem.

- que:
  - and what would you suggest, my most devious mentat?
  ans:
  - offer an increase in spice royalties...... payable in advance from rabban's own reserves...

- que:
  - hasn't it?
  ans:
  - your assassin didn't arrive here without help.

- que:
  - but who could you suspect?
  ans:
  - i can only suspect.

- que:
  - surely not yueh?
  ans:
  - his suk conditioning would drive him mad first.

- que:
  - how could i miss him?
  ans:
  - the man with thufir is esmar tuek, smuggler, highly successful.

- que:
  - water customs here are so fascinating...... don't you think, your highness?
  ans:
  - when i arrived, my bathing towels were hurried away almost before i was dry.

- que:
  - you mean they are cannibals?
  ans:
  - i said they drink blood, not necessarily the blood of their own kind.

- que:
  - isn't that so, dr. kynes?
  ans:
  - not the blood, sir.

- que:
  - beloved?
  ans:
  - you young pup.

- que:
  - is it atreides custom to abandon an honored guest...... without even the courtesy of a lame excuse?
  ans:
  - forgive me, your highness.

- que:
  - you were expecting someone more delicate, perhaps?
  ans:
  - refined was the word i had in mind, actually.

- que:
  - are you gonna dance with me or just stand there looking confused?
  ans:
  - i didn't want to come here, you know.

- que:
  - have you been hurt?
  ans:
  - be still, captain.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - perhaps we should be the adults here.

- que:
  - duncan?
  ans:
  - forgive the abrupt arrival, milord.

- que:
  - duncan?
  ans:
  - paul.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - traitor.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - god forgive me.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - not in quarters, sir.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - you promised we'd be reunited.

- que:
  - so where is she?
  ans:
  - your wife is free, my good doctor.

- que:
  - my noble duke, are you enjoying the show?
  ans:
  - i hope so.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - paul.

- que:
  - we couldn't have all that noble blood all over our hands, could we?
  ans:
  - the emperor was quite insistent about that.

- que:
  - did i say that?
  ans:
  - how impolitic of me.

- que:
  - you won't say anything will you, my dear man?
  ans:
  - perhaps we should get on with it, then.

- que:
  - the tooth.
  ans:
  - get on with it?

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - tooth.

- que:
  - what did he say, piter?
  ans:
  - the tooth.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - we won't survive longer than a few hours in the open.

- que:
  - one of ours?
  ans:
  - we can't take the chance.

- que:
  - what is this place?
  ans:
  - a fremen sietch.

- que:
  - how did you know where to find us?
  ans:
  - dr. yueh sent a courier.

- que:
  - you're the one, aren't you?
  ans:
  - the one who's never seen, the one who may not even exist at all.

- que:
  - guiding them?
  ans:
  - until mahdi comes.

- que:
  - you're coming with us?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i'm dr. kynes.

- que:
  - i work for the emperor, you remember?
  ans:
  - i'll just say i was your hostage.

- que:
  - unless they want to die, they won't follow us in, will they?
  ans:
  - i must not fear.

- que:
  - opening nights?
  ans:
  - i love opening nights.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - good to see you.

- que:
  - sir herbert, how are you?
  ans:
  - this is my wife.

- que:
  - one of mr barrie's finest?
  ans:
  - oh, that genius scotsman has done it again.

- que:
  - sorry?
  ans:
  - good audience tonight.

- que:
  - how much longer?
  ans:
  - um, ten minutes, sir.

- que:
  - how are you, john?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - healthy and wealthy, i see.

- que:
  - have you got the tickets?
  ans:
  - they're in my pocket.

- que:
  - have you seen him?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure where he is, actually.

- que:
  - are you right to find your seat?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, yes.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - it's like a dentist's office out there.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't say they hate it, sir.

- que:
  - do you like it?
  ans:
  - i've just been hired here, sir.

- que:
  - yes or no?
  ans:
  - i'm not bothered.

- que:
  - crap, sir?
  ans:
  - go on, say it.

- que:
  - it's shite, isn't it?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - might i knock a tune, milord, for a moment?
  ans:
  - i'm an old man...... and i've seen few of the sights.

- que:
  - can you?
  ans:
  - no, i can't.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - arthur.

- que:
  - was i?
  ans:
  - we were beginning to wonder which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

- que:
  - oh, yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them, should we?
  ans:
  - i don't see why not.

- que:
  - you remember mr and mrs snow, don't you?
  ans:
  - mrs snow.

- que:
  - was it?
  ans:
  - well, thank you.

- que:
  - how did you feel it went?
  ans:
  - i think i can do better.

- que:
  - yes, james?
  ans:
  - i'm headed off for the park if you'd like to join me.

- que:
  - you'll be working, won't you?
  ans:
  - perhaps, yes.

- que:
  - who do you belong to?
  ans:
  - come on, boy.

- que:
  - am i?
  ans:
  - so sorry.

- que:
  - well, if you're trapped in the dungeon, there isn't much to be done now, is there?
  ans:
  - perhaps i could slide a key to you through the bars.

- que:
  - is he bothering you, sir?
  ans:
  - my brother can be an extremely irritating sort of person.

- que:
  - what did you say your name was?
  ans:
  - michael.

- que:
  - what precisely is michael's crime?
  ans:
  - he's my younger brother.

- que:

  ans:
  - peter.

- que:
  - peter, where are your manners?
  ans:
  - with those eyes, my bonny lad, i'm afraid you'd never see it.

- que:
  - peter, didn't you enjoy that?
  ans:
  - i've seen better.

- que:
  - what's her name?
  ans:
  - sylvia.

- que:
  - you know her?
  ans:

  - where's your mother today and the rest of the boys?
  ans:
  - home.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me, charles?
  ans:
  - you knew it wasn't any good.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me, james?
  ans:
  - you knew it wasn't any good.

- que:
  - hm?
  ans:
  - i took an extended lease on the theater, keeping the actors on.

- que:
  - won't you?
  ans:
  - we'll see.

- que:
  - you know what happened, james?
  ans:
  - they changed it.

- que:
  - they changed what?
  ans:
  - the critics.

- que:
  - what's it called?
  ans:
  - bang, bang, bang!

- que:
  - ooh, we are awful, aren't we?
  ans:
  - i'm warning you.

- que:
  - well, grief affects us all in different ways, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - yes, it does.

- que:
  - don't you all look lovely in your little suits?
  ans:
  - and, mrs du maurier, what a shame it is that we've not met until this evening.

- que:
  - where did you get your manners?
  ans:
  - sorry, grandmother.

- que:
  - what was it?
  ans:
  - tsetse fly.

- que:
  - but the fishing was good, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - james.

- que:
  - a grown man, for heaven's sake, playing all day long with children?
  ans:
  - in any case, i hardly think they'll be the social contact we'd hoped for.

- que:
  - i want to do it.
  ans:
  - but what does that mean?

- que:
  - that's good.
  ans:
  - you coming, peter?

- que:
  - now, would you like to give it a go?
  ans:
  - yes, please.

- que:
  - look, i think i feel a bit more breeze.
  ans:
  - ready?

- que:
  - are you ready, michael?
  ans:
  - oh, just making notes.

- que:
  - now, why do you ask that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why not give it a try?
  ans:
  - i hope you haven't been talking about anything too serious with this one.

- que:
  - can we have him for supper?
  ans:
  - have him to stay for supper, michael.

- que:
  - where have you been?
  ans:
  - flying a kite, mother, and having a wonderful time.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - well, apparently you forgot then.

- que:
  - well, there's no food in the house, is there?
  ans:
  - really.

- que:
  - will we see you tomorrow?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - it was a lovely meal.

- que:
  - listen, what would you think of loaning ema out to the davies for the occasional evening?
  ans:
  - they don't actually have a cook.

- que:
  - i take it mrs davies enjoyed the meal that she had here?
  ans:
  - i imagine she could use an extra hand now and again.

- que:
  - and what about linen?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't be surprised if some of hers was looking a bit shabby.

- que:
  - yes, well, we dream on a budget here, don't we?
  ans:
  - no, i mean, everyone thinks it's made of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - all great writers begin with a good leather binding and a respectable title.

- que:
  - what whale?
  ans:
  - the one that's trapped in your imagination and desperate to get out.

- que:
  - a play?
  ans:
  - a play indeed, yes.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - neverland.

- que:
  - neverland?
  ans:
  - one day i'll take you there.

- que:
  - he's a fairy?
  ans:
  - er, no.

- que:
  - tinker bell is a woman?
  ans:
  - she's not a woman.

- que:
  - james, how does anyone stay young forever?
  ans:
  - it doesn't work.

- que:
  - he imagines life the way he wants it to be, and he believes in it long enough and hard enough that it all appears before him, see?
  ans:
  - james, i'm your friend.

- que:
  - you know what i think i'll do?
  ans:
  - i think i'll imagine life the way i want it to be...

- que:
  - long enough and hard enough?
  ans:
  - yes, and then the money for the play will appear magically before me.

- que:
  - how does the clock wind up inside the crocodile?
  ans:
  - well done.

- que:
  - spend a good deal of time with them, don't you?
  ans:
  - every moment i can spare, in fact.

- que:
  - what are they saying?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - how could anyone think something so evil?
  ans:
  - they're children.

- que:
  - then why is no one sitting with them?
  ans:
  - once you get a bit of notoriety, james, people watch you and they will look for ways to drag you down.

- que:
  - are you sure your wife doesn't object to us taking over your cottage for the summer, james?
  ans:
  - she doesn't go there anymore.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - it's such a relief to get away.

- que:
  - you'll come and visit, i hope?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - can i drive, uncle jim?
  ans:
  - er, no.

- que:
  - are we there yet?
  ans:
  - don't tear your clothes, please.

- que:
  - would you like to see the rest of it?
  ans:
  - off to the ship with you, then.

- que:
  - well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?
  ans:
  - no one's escaped, captain.

- que:
  - not finished yet.
  ans:
  - who amongst you is ready to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - i said i'm ready, captain.

- que:
  - what's your name, boy?
  ans:
  - i'm curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

- que:
  - and who be you, young squire?
  ans:
  - my name be nibs the cut throat.

- que:
  - and you, lad?
  ans:
  - i'm peter.

- que:
  - what about dastardly jim, eh?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what are you playing again?
  ans:
  - the boy.

- que:
  - what have you got...?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - mr barrie, sir?
  ans:
  - there's been a mistake here, sir.

- que:
  - i don't imagine i quite fit that part, eh?
  ans:
  - you're not actually the nanny.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - a newfoundland.

- que:
  - actually, we don't have a tinker bell cast, do we?
  ans:
  - he could play tinker bell.

- que:
  - how were rehearsals?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - how was your journey?
  ans:
  - it was quite long.

- que:
  - can you come to the playhouse?
  ans:
  - in a moment, michael.

- que:
  - what surprise, darling?
  ans:
  - it's a great surprise.

- que:
  - oh, well, you didn't really tell us anything about it, did you?
  ans:
  - yes i did.

- que:
  - it's a play?
  ans:
  - the lamentable tale of lady ursula.

- que:
  - mother?
  ans:
  - no, james.

- que:
  - when would i have time for that?
  ans:
  - besides, this family's had enough of hospitals.

- que:
  - what did you and mother decide to tell us this time?
  ans:
  - we hadn't decided anything.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - peter.

- que:
  - magic's gone out of it a bit now, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - all because of a silly chest cold.

- que:
  - well, you remember gilbert cannan, don't you?
  ans:
  - good evening.

- que:
  - not so late?
  ans:
  - that will be fine.

- que:
  - what would you like me to say?
  ans:
  - and then, let's see.

- que:
  - what comes next?
  ans:
  - no later than you were out, james.

- que:
  - oh, yes, i would have a great answer for that one, wouldn't i?
  ans:
  - how dare you.

- que:
  - perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
  ans:
  - good night then.

- que:
  - don't you agree this is a little bit tight?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - baggy?
  ans:
  - quite frumpy.

- que:
  - plank of wood?
  ans:
  - some wood there on the shoulders as well.

- que:
  - may i take your hat?
  ans:
  - that's enough, boys.

- que:
  - boys, why don't you go and play in the garden?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - is he in trouble?
  ans:
  - sh.

- que:
  - why don't you join them, dear?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - would you close the door, please?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - you're moving in?
  ans:
  - i'm going where i'm most needed.

- que:
  - don't you see what a visit to the summer cottage of a married man does for a widow's future prospects?
  ans:
  - sylvia needs to find someone.

- que:
  - what are you suggesting?
  ans:
  - i'm suggesting that you protect what you have, mr barrie.

- que:
  - still, you knew who i meant, didn't you?
  ans:
  - that's some comfort, actually.

- que:
  - what was i supposed to do, james?
  ans:
  - you were always gone.

- que:
  - to spend with your muse?
  ans:
  - no, i'm tired of waiting, james.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - first you get the pajamas, then you make the bed.

- que:
  - with my paws?
  ans:
  - you make the bed with your paws.

- que:
  - because in fact, being a dog, you haven't any proper digits, have you?
  ans:
  - well, i don't have any teeth, either.

- que:
  - can we get him some teeth?
  ans:
  - he can have mine.

- que:
  - let's have a wee break, shall we?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - you know how much money i put into this show that i haven't even found yet?
  ans:
  - listen, listen.

- que:
  - 25?
  ans:
  - 25 seats.

- que:
  - are they paying for it?
  ans:
  - they're filled.

- que:
  - uncle jim?
  ans:
  - hello, boys.

- que:
  - could i speak to you for a moment, please?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - who's paying for them?
  ans:
  - throughout the theater.

- que:
  - who's paying for these 25 seats?
  ans:
  - they're filled up seats, charles.

- que:
  - we don't need to use much pull at all, see?
  ans:
  - as long as we've got the balance down.

- que:
  - but you think it's serious?
  ans:
  - it could be.

- que:
  - she's run you off, hasn't she?
  ans:
  - oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.

- que:
  - what's happened?
  ans:
  - yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

- que:
  - can i have a go?
  ans:
  - in a minute.

- que:
  - can i have a go?
  ans:
  - jack.

- que:
  - i'm so sorry.
  ans:
  - what are you...?

- que:
  - mr barrie?
  ans:
  - mrs davies would like a word with you.

- que:
  - encourage what?
  ans:
  - oh, james, please.

- que:
  - so you've already spoken to a doctor then?
  ans:
  - that is not your concern.

- que:
  - peter, could you help george to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?
  ans:
  - they're in the linen cupboard.

- que:
  - darling?
  ans:
  - yes, mother.

- que:
  - would you check your shirt tails in the intermission, please?
  ans:
  - yes, mother.

- que:
  - you're not planning on attending any after theater events, are you?
  ans:
  - only for a short time if we do.

- que:
  - would you see if george has the tickets, please?
  ans:
  - i'll just check the dressing table.

- que:
  - michael, where are your socks?
  ans:
  - wait here, don't move.

- que:
  - oh, take michael with you, would you?
  ans:
  - she looks much worse than when we were at the cottage.

- que:
  - those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - have there been many people asking for seats?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - the 25 seats, are they filled?
  ans:
  - it's taken care of.

- que:
  - who did you invite?
  ans:
  - because obviously whoever you invited decided not to come.

- que:
  - charles?
  ans:
  - hello, mr stanley.

- que:
  - have you seen the davies family this evening?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - can i do anything, mother?
  ans:
  - no, darling.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - take it out.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - they're here.

- que:
  - who's here?
  ans:
  - do forgive them being a bit late short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - no one there.

- que:
  - how is she?
  ans:
  - she's resting.

- que:
  - may i see her?
  ans:
  - no, mr barrie.

- que:
  - yes, darling?
  ans:
  - james.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - this needs mending.

- que:
  - boys, would you give me a moment with your mother, please?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - we've pretended for some time now that you're a part of this family, haven't we?
  ans:
  - you've come to mean so much to us all that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

- que:
  - how do you do it?
  ans:
  - you just think lovely, wonderful thoughts and they lift you up in the air.

- que:
  - couldn't you do it very slowly once?
  ans:
  - yes, i've got it now, wendy.

- que:
  - are you sure there's nothing else i can do for you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - perhaps some time soon though?
  ans:
  - most definitely.

- que:
  - d'you mean we shall both be drowned?
  ans:
  - look how the water is rising.

- que:
  - why shouldn't it carry you?
  ans:
  - both of us.

- que:
  - and you a lady?
  ans:
  - never.

- que:
  - quite the scandal, so i'm told.
  ans:
  - ready, wendy?

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - i'm all right.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - where's mr snow this evening?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - how are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm doing well enough now, thank you.

- que:
  - i suppose it's all the work of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?
  ans:
  - time is chasing after all of us.

- que:
  - isn't that right?
  ans:
  - that's right, mrs snow.

- que:
  - was that mr barrie?
  ans:
  - that was mr barrie.

- que:
  - it's about our summer together, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it is.

- que:
  - did you like it?
  ans:
  - it's magical.

- que:
  - you're peter pan?
  ans:
  - why, you must be quite the little adventurer.

- que:
  - and there's been no improvement since my last visit?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - has james been by at all today, mother?
  ans:
  - dr brighton.

- que:
  - may i have a word?
  ans:
  - excuse me a moment.

- que:
  - you haven't been keeping him from me, have you?
  ans:
  - as a matter of fact, i actually hoped he might come.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it's a secret.

- que:
  - mother, could you come downstairs for a moment?
  ans:
  - oh, she can't come downstairs.

- que:
  - what are you thinking of, george?
  ans:
  - actually, i think a trip downstairs might do her good, ma'am.

- que:
  - what have you been up to?
  ans:
  - just wait and see.

- que:
  - you know fairies, peter?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - isn't there?
  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?
  ans:
  - i'll rescue her.

- que:
  - who could have poisoned it?
  ans:
  - why, tink.

- que:
  - and you drank it to save my life?
  ans:
  - tink.

- que:
  - are you dying?
  ans:
  - her light is growing faint.

- que:
  - do you believe in fairies?
  ans:
  - say quick that you believe.

- que:
  - george, would you take the boys back to the house?
  ans:
  - i'll be with you in a moment.

- que:
  - meaning what?
  ans:
  - sylvia has requested a co guardianship for the boys in her will.

- que:
  - and what do you have to say about that?
  ans:
  - i shall respect my daughter's wishes.

- que:
  - do you think i could abandon those boys?
  ans:
  - sit down, peter.

- que:
  - but why did she have to die?
  ans:
  - i don't know, boy.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - by believing, peter.

- que:
  - opening nights?
  ans:
  - i love opening nights.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - good to see you.

- que:
  - sir herbert, how are you?
  ans:
  - this is my wife.

- que:
  - one of mr barrie's finest?
  ans:
  - oh, that genius scotsman has done it again.

- que:
  - sorry?
  ans:
  - good audience tonight.

- que:
  - how much longer?
  ans:
  - um, ten minutes, sir.

- que:
  - how are you, john?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - healthy and wealthy, i see.

- que:
  - have you got the tickets?
  ans:
  - they're in my pocket.

- que:
  - have you seen him?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure where he is, actually.

- que:
  - are you right to find your seat?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, yes.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - it's like a dentist's office out there.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't say they hate it, sir.

- que:
  - do you like it?
  ans:
  - i've just been hired here, sir.

- que:
  - yes or no?
  ans:
  - i'm not bothered.

- que:
  - crap, sir?
  ans:
  - go on, say it.

- que:
  - it's shite, isn't it?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - might i knock a tune, milord, for a moment?
  ans:
  - i'm an old man..... and i've seen few of the sights.

- que:
  - can you?
  ans:
  - no, i can't.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - arthur.

- que:
  - was i?
  ans:
  - we were beginning to wonder which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

- que:
  - oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them, should we?
  ans:
  - i don't see why not.

- que:
  - you remember mr and mrs snow, don't you?
  ans:
  - mrs snow.

- que:
  - was it?
  ans:
  - well, thank you.

- que:
  - how did you feel it went?
  ans:
  - i think i can do better.

- que:
  - yes, james?
  ans:
  - i'm headed off for the park if you'd like to join me.

- que:
  - you'll be working, won't you?
  ans:
  - perhaps, yes.

- que:
  - who do you belong to?
  ans:
  - come on, boy.

- que:
  - am i?
  ans:
  - so sorry.

- que:
  - well, if you're trapped in the dungeon, there isn't much to be done now, is there?
  ans:
  - perhaps i could slide a key to you through the bars.

- que:
  - is he bothering you, sir?
  ans:
  - my brother can be an extremely irritating sort of person.

- que:
  - what did you say your name was?
  ans:
  - michael.

- que:
  - what precisely is michael's crime?
  ans:
  - he's my younger brother.

  ans:
  - well, currently, i make my living entertaining princes and their courts with my trained bear, porthos.

- que:
  - what did you bring me over here for?
  ans:
  - peter.

- que:
  - peter, where are your manners?
  ans:
  - with those eyes, my bonny lad, i'm afraid you'd never see it.

- que:
  - peter, didn't you enjoy that?
  ans:
  - i've seen better.

- que:
  - what's her name?
  ans:
  - sylvia.

- que:
  - you know her?
  ans:
  - i know who she is, of course.

  ans:
  - tsetse fly.

- que:
  - but the fishing was good, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - james.

- que:
  - a grown man, for heaven's sake, playing all day long with children?

  - in any case, i hardly think they'll be the social contact we'd hoped for.

- que:
  - i want to do it.
  ans:
  - but what does that mean?

- que:
  - that's good.
  ans:
  - you coming, peter?

  - yes, please.

- que:
  - look, i think i feel a bit more breeze.
  ans:
  - ready?

- que:
  - are you ready, michael?
  ans:
  - oh, just making notes.

- que:
  - now, why do you ask that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why not give it a try?
  ans:
  - i hope you haven't been talking about anything too serious with this one.

- que:
  - can we have him for supper?
  ans:
  - have him to stay for supper, michael.

- que:
  - where have you been?
  ans:
  - flying a kite, mother, and having a wonderful time.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - well, apparently you forgot then.

- que:
  - well, there's no food in the house, is there?
  ans:
  - really.

- que:
  - will we see you tomorrow?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - it was a lovely meal.

- que:
  - listen, what would you think of loaning emma out to the davies for the occasional evening?
  ans:
  - they don't actually have a cook.

- que:
  - i take it mrs davies enjoyed the meal that she had here?
  ans:
  - i imagine she could use an extra hand now and again.

- que:
  - and what about linen?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't be surprised if some of hers was looking a bit shabby.

- que:
  - yes, well, we dream on a budget here, don't we?
  ans:
  - no, i mean, everyone thinks it's made of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - all great writers begin with a good leather binding and a respectable title.

- que:
  - what whale?
  ans:
  - the one that's trapped in your imagination and desperate to get out.

- que:
  - a play?
  ans:
  - a play indeed, yes.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - neverland.

- que:
  - neverland?
  ans:
  - one day i'll take you there.

- que:
  - he's a fairy?
  ans:
  - er, no.

- que:
  - tinker bell is a woman?
  ans:
  - she's not a woman.

- que:
  - james, how does anyone stay young forever?
  ans:
  - it doesn't work.

- que:
  - he imagines life the way he wants it to be, and he believes in it long enough and hard enough that it all appears before him, see?
  ans:
  - james, i'm your friend.

- que:
  - you know what i think i'll do?
  ans:
  - i think i'll imagine life the way i want it to be...

- que:
  - long enough and hard enough?
  ans:
  - yes, and then the money for the play will appear magically before me.

- que:
  - how does the clock wind up inside the crocodile?
  ans:
  - well done.

- que:
  - spend a good deal of time with them, don't you?
  ans:
  - every moment i can spare, in fact.

- que:
  - what are they saying?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - how could anyone think something so evil?
  ans:
  - they're children.

- que:
  - then why is no one sitting with them?
  ans:
  - once you get a bit of notoriety, james, people watch you and they will look for ways to drag you down.

- que:
  - are you sure your wife doesn't object to us taking over your cottage for the summer, james?
  ans:
  - she doesn't go there anymore.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - it's such a relief to get away.

- que:
  - you'll come and visit, i hope?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - can i drive, uncle jim?
  ans:
  - er, no.

- que:
  - are we there yet?
  ans:
  - don't tear your clothes, please.

- que:
  - would you like to see the rest of it?
  ans:
  - off to the ship with you, then.

- que:
  - well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?
  ans:
  - no one's escaped, captain.

- que:
  - not finished yet.
  ans:
  - who amongst you is ready to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - i said i'm ready, captain.

- que:
  - what's your name, boy?
  ans:
  - i'm curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

- que:
  - and who be you, young squire?
  ans:
  - my name be nibs the cut throat.

- que:
  - and you, lad?
  ans:
  - i'm peter.

- que:
  - what about dastardly jim, eh?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what are you playing again?
  ans:
  - the boy.

- que:
  - what have you got...?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - mr barrie, sir?
  ans:
  - there's been a mistake here, sir.

- que:
  - i don't imagine i quite fit that part, eh?
  ans:
  - you're not actually the nanny.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - a newfound land.

- que:
  - actually, we don't have a tinker bell cast, do we?
  ans:
  - he could play tinker bell.

- que:
  - how were rehearsals?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - how was your journey?
  ans:
  - it was quite long.

- que:
  - can you come to the playhouse?
  ans:
  - in a moment, michael.

- que:
  - what surprise, darling?
  ans:
  - it's a great surprise.

- que:
  - oh, well, you didn't really tell us anything about it, did you?
  ans:
  - yes i did.

- que:
  - it's a play?
  ans:
  - the lamentable tale of lady ursula.

- que:
  - mother?
  ans:
  - no, james.

- que:
  - when would i have time for that?
  ans:
  - besides, this family's had enough of hospitals.

- que:
  - what did you and mother decide to tell us this time?
  ans:
  - we hadn't decided anything.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - peter.

- que:
  - magic's gone out of it a bit now, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - all because of a silly chest cold.

- que:
  - well, you remember gilbert cannan, don't you?
  ans:
  - good evening.

- que:
  - not so late?
  ans:
  - that will be fine.

- que:
  - what would you like me to say?
  ans:
  - and then, let's see.

- que:
  - what comes next?
  ans:
  - no later than you were out, james.

- que:
  - oh, yes, i would have a great answer for that one, wouldn't i?
  ans:
  - how dare you.

- que:
  - perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
  ans:
  - good night then.

- que:
  - don't you agree this is a little bit tight?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - baggy?
  ans:
  - quite frumpy.

- que:
  - plank of wood?
  ans:
  - some wood there on the shoulders as well.

- que:
  - may i take your hat?
  ans:
  - that's enough, boys.

- que:
  - boys, why don't you go and play in the garden?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - is he in trouble?
  ans:
  - sh.

- que:
  - why don't you join them, dear?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - would you close the door, please?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - you're moving in?
  ans:
  - i'm going where i'm most needed.

- que:
  - don't you see what a visit to the summer cottage of a married man does for a widow's future prospects?
  ans:
  - sylvia needs to find someone.

- que:
  - what are you suggesting?
  ans:
  - i'm suggesting that you protect what you have, mr barrie.

- que:
  - still, you knew who i meant, didn't you?
  ans:
  - that's some comfort, actually.

- que:
  - what was i supposed to do, james?
  ans:
  - you were always gone.

- que:
  - to spend with your muse?
  ans:
  - no, i'm tired of waiting, james.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - first you get the pajamas, then you make the bed.

- que:
  - with my paws?
  ans:
  - you make the bed with your paws.

- que:
  - because in fact, being a dog, you haven't any proper digits, have you?
  ans:
  - well, i don't have any teeth, either.

- que:
  - can we get him some teeth?
  ans:
  - he can have mine.

- que:
  - let's have a wee break, shall we?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - you know how much money i put into this show that i haven't even found yet?
  ans:
  - listen, listen.

- que:
  - 25?
  ans:
  - 25 seats.

- que:
  - are they paying for it?
  ans:
  - they're filled.

- que:
  - uncle jim?
  ans:
  - hello, boys.

- que:
  - could i speak to you for a moment, please?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - who's paying for them?
  ans:
  - throughout the theater.

- que:
  - who's paying for these 25 seats?
  ans:
  - they're filled up seats, charles.

- que:
  - we don't need to use much pull at all, see?
  ans:
  - as long as we've got the balance down.

- que:
  - but you think it's serious?
  ans:
  - it could be.

- que:
  - she's run you off, hasn't she?
  ans:
  - oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.

- que:
  - what's happened?
  ans:
  - yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

- que:
  - can i have a go?
  ans:
  - in a minute.

- que:
  - can i have a go?
  ans:
  - jack.

- que:
  - i'm so sorry.
  ans:
  - what are you...?

- que:
  - mr barrie?
  ans:
  - mrs davies would like a word with you.

- que:
  - encourage what?
  ans:
  - oh, james, please.

- que:
  - so you've already spoken to a doctor then?
  ans:
  - that is not your concern.

- que:
  - peter, could you help george to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?
  ans:
  - they're in the linen cupboard.

- que:
  - darling?
  ans:
  - yes, mother.

- que:
  - would you check your shirt tails in the intermission, please?
  ans:
  - yes, mother.

- que:
  - you're not planning on attending any after theater events, are you?
  ans:
  - only for a short time if we do.

- que:
  - would you see if george has the tickets, please?
  ans:
  - i'll just check the dressing table.

- que:
  - michael, where are your socks?
  ans:
  - wait here, don't move.

- que:
  - oh, take michael with you, would you?
  ans:
  - she looks much worse than when we were at the cottage.

- que:
  - those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - have there been many people asking for seats?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - the 25 seats, are they filled?
  ans:
  - it's taken care of.

- que:
  - who did you invite?
  ans:
  - because obviously whoever you invited decided not to come.

  - how is she?
  ans:
  - she's resting.

- que:
  - may i see her?
  ans:
  - no, mr barrie.

- que:
  - yes, darling?
  ans:
  - james.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - this needs mending.

- que:
  - boys, would you give me a moment with your mother, please?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - we've pretended for some time now that you're a part of this family, haven't we?
  ans:
  - you've come to mean so much to us all that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

- que:
  - how do you do it?
  ans:
  - you just think lovely, wonderful thoughts and they lift you up in the air.

- que:
  - couldn't you do it very slowly once?
  ans:
  - yes, i've got it now, wendy.

- que:
  - are you sure there's nothing else i can do for you?
  ans:
  - no.

  - most definitely.

- que:
  - d'you mean we shall both be drowned?

- que:
  - why shouldn't it carry you?

  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - how are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm doing well enough now, thank you.

- que:
  - i suppose it's all the work of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?
  ans:
  - time is chasing after all of us.

- que:
  - isn't that right?
  ans:
  - that's right, mrs snow.

- que:
  - was that mr barrie?

  ans:
  - it's a secret.

- que:
  - mother, could you come downstairs for a moment?
  ans:
  - oh, she can't come downstairs.

- que:
  - what are you thinking of, george?
  ans:
  - actually, i think a trip downstairs might do her good, ma'am.

  ans:
  - tink.

- que:
  - are you dying?
  ans:
  - her light is growing faint.

  - do you think i could abandon those boys?
  ans:
  - sit down, peter.

- que:
  - but why did she have to die?
  ans:
  - i don't know, boy.

  - are you right to find your seat?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, yes.

  ans:
  - i've just been hired here, sir.

  ans:
  - no one i know.

- que:
  - what the hell happened?
  ans:
  - i said no monkey business.

- que:

- que:
  - what's happened to little jack?
  ans:

- que:
  - and why are you wearing antlers?
  ans:
  - it's very complicated.

- que:
  - little jack, honey, are you okay?
  ans:
  - greg...

- que:
  - how's the little guy doing?
  ans:
  - everything is just as good as new.

- que:

- que:
  - what kind of sick cocktail were you gonna make my grandson?
  ans:
  - jack, the baby's teething.

- que:
  - it was your idea?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what is wrong with you people?
  ans:
  - i used to rub bourbon on denny's gums.

- que:
  - greg, you couldn't follow a simple set of instructions?
  ans:
  - jack, he was screaming.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - he's learning to self soothe.

  ans:
  - jack, i am not going to make any excuses.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:

  ans:
  - i think he did.

- que:
  - little jack, what did you just say?
  ans:
  - asshole.

- que:
  - his first word?
  ans:
  - it just slipped out of my mouth.

- que:
  - has greg ever mentioned the name jorge to you?
  ans:
  - jor...

- que:
  - no, why?
  ans:
  - because i think your fiance may have a few skeletons in his closet that he is not telling you about.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - he does not.

- que:
  - do you know that?
  ans:
  - yes, i know that.

- que:
  - how could i keep it a secret?
  ans:
  - he's so excited about being a grandpa.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - jack's really angry.

- que:
  - how often do we get to be grandparents?
  ans:
  - we're having a toast.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - we are honest people.

- que:
  - why?

  - be quiet.

- que:
  - why should we diminish our joy just because they live in denial?
  ans:
  - seriously.

- que:
  - i promised pam, okay?
  ans:
  - she thinks it'll break his heart if he finds out.

- que:
  - what's the matter what happened?
  ans:
  - i was, uh, coming to apologize and my back went into spasm.

- que:
  - you must be in a lot of pain, huh?
  ans:
  - i don't mind pain.

- que:
  - does she still climax regularly?
  ans:
  - mom.

- que:
  - i know.
  ans:
  - you can't talk that way this weekend, okay?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - don't... don't worry about them.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no, i hate that thing.

- que:
  - duck hunting?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - gay, you went duck hunting with... with jack?
  ans:
  - um, yeah.

- que:
  - you shot a duck?

- que:
  - you killed an innocent creature of the sky?
  ans:
  - i don't...

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - it's you.

- que:
  - isn't it nice to finally display your accomplishments, son?
  ans:
  - this one looks impressive.

- que:
  - you know what i mean, jack?
  ans:
  - not really, bernard.

- que:
  - what kind of work does your mother do with those patients?
  ans:
  - those look like yoga mats.

- que:
  - is there yoga involved?
  ans:
  - good, roz.

- que:
  - and who's this little hairball?
  ans:
  - they brought their grandson baby jack along.

- que:
  - bern, did you show them where they're sleeping?
  ans:
  - right, right, right.

- que:
  - in the trailer?
  ans:
  - come on, jack.

- que:
  - let it go?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - why don't we go show them the lagoon?
  ans:
  - the lagoon.

- que:
  - roz, why don't you take them outside?
  ans:
  - show them around.

- que:
  - it's going good so far, right?
  ans:
  - dad, you gotta take down that weird shrine thing.

- que:
  - what's wrong with showing it?
  ans:
  - it's ridiculous.

- que:
  - since when do you care about most people?
  ans:
  - i don't, but jack is really into winning and competition and sports.

- que:
  - oh, for pity's sake.
  ans:
  - you're avoiding confusion by strapping a boob on a man?

- que:
  - isn't that nice, jack?
  ans:
  - that is nice.

- que:
  - i thought you had a sister?
  ans:
  - nope.

- que:
  - i went overboard?
  ans:
  - a little bit.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - after all this build up, the kids are finally getting married.

- que:
  - little jack, were you about to speak?
  ans:
  - nope, just a little flatulence.

- que:
  - what were you saying, honey?
  ans:
  - nothing, dear.

- que:
  - guys, where are you going?
  ans:
  - we're checking out jack's macho wacho trailer.

- que:
  - you're pregnant?
  ans:
  - no, no, no, no, no.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - we'll tell them all.

- que:
  - oh, honey, he was trying to save his pet.
  ans:
  - what about my toilet?

- que:
  - i mean, what if it was jinxy who got flushed into a toilet?
  ans:
  - mr. jinx has had extensive aquatic training.

- que:
  - so, what do you wanna do?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - then we'll tell your dad you got pregnant on the honeymoon.

- que:
  - it's perfect, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you do that yourself?
  ans:
  - oh, sure.

- que:
  - high powered?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't exactly call...

- que:
  - why did you kick me?
  ans:
  - truth is, jack, when gay was born, i stopped practicing and became a stay at home dad.

- que:
  - so roz was the primary breadwinner and you didn't have a job?
  ans:
  - dad.

- que:
  - is that isabel?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - you know, she has her own catering business now, isn't that great?
  ans:
  - and... and i asked her to come and help bernie in the kitchen this weekend.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i didn't have any monster crush.

- que:
  - then i didn't catch you doing baziga to her passport photo when you were, what, 13?
  ans:
  - honey, stop.

- que:
  - nice to meet you, too.
  ans:
  - where is he?

- que:
  - not yet married, and already a little one?
  ans:
  - and he is a handsome little focker.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - and still you stayed to raise her child?
  ans:
  - good for you.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - oh, she's just being silly.

- que:
  - hey, do you guys want some more, uh, wine?
  ans:
  - mas vino por la mama, si.

- que:
  - she's very pretty, this one, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah, she's, uh, she's really great.

- que:
  - can you believe it's been 15 years?
  ans:
  - so many wonderful memories from those days.

- que:
  - so, you never told your fiance about us, huh?
  ans:
  - um, no, i don't think i did.

- que:
  - you s slept with isabel?
  ans:
  - we were relieved.

- que:
  - what's the problem?
  ans:
  - it was, what, 15 years ago.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - that sounds like fun.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i suggest that we get back to talking about the wedding.

- que:
  - mom, didn't you just take little jack back to the room?
  ans:
  - i'm monitoring him from a high powered multidirectional microphone planted in his crib.

- que:
  - whatever happened to a little thing called privacy?
  ans:
  - bernie, surveillance technology has helped protect a lot of the freedoms that we as americans take advantage of today.

- que:
  - the clla?
  ans:
  - the central lack of intelligence agency.

- que:
  - you're what?
  ans:
  - the ferber method.

- que:
  - look at his darling little teeth, isn't that sweet?
  ans:
  - uh oh, somebody looks very grumpy there.

- que:
  - the mohel?
  ans:
  - no.

  - let's not talk about the tiny turtle, okay?
  ans:
  - let's...

- que:
  - what's a semicirc?
  ans:
  - i can't wait to hear this.

- que:

  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - anyone in the mood for chinese?
  ans:
  - you told me your first time was with the danish transfer student in high school.

- que:
  - can we just let it go, please?
  ans:
  - we both got enough stuff to deal with this weekend.

- que:
  - how do you mean?
  ans:
  - i know that you are studying my family like the frozen caveman.

- que:
  - so, i just, i don't want you to be worried, okay?
  ans:
  - i mean, they're a little quirky, but they they're well intentioned and... and i think they're just nervous and...

- que:
  - who's bern?
  ans:
  - i'm chad, the bellhop.

- que:
  - can't you be sam the carpet cleaning man?
  ans:
  - it's illogical.

- que:
  - why would a carpet cleaner have whipped cream?
  ans:
  - well, improvise, honey.

- que:
  - do you mind if i put some foam down on your rug?
  ans:
  - i don't mind at all.

- que:
  - how long... how long have you worked in this hotel?
  ans:
  - it's time to put some snow on your mountains.

- que:
  - come on, man, you know what that cowboy hat on the door means.
  ans:
  - gay, you see the cowboy hat on the door?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we're just being ourselves.

- que:
  - i mean, why you're so afraid of this jack?
  ans:
  - you've been kissing his ass ever since you got here.

- que:
  - so you don't want us to be ourselves?
  ans:
  - mom...

- que:
  - just don't therapize the byrneses this weekend at all, okay?
  ans:
  - all i'm saying is, a few minutes of concentrated work with him and dina, she could get him to blow like krakatoa.

- que:
  - right, okay, yeah, you know what?
  ans:
  - one day, just give me one day, okay, without any complications.

- que:
  - can we do that?
  ans:
  - all right.

  - what?
  ans:
  - oh, a spritzer.

- que:
  - dad, you got to focus, all right?
  ans:
  - he's beating you down the field every time.

- que:
  - what are you really asking me to do, gaylord?
  ans:
  - i'm not asking anything of you, dad.

- que:
  - just... just go down there and apologize to him, okay?
  ans:
  - he thinks it was a cheap shot.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - come on, honey, i knew it the minute i saw her.

- que:
  - you didn't tell dad, did you?
  ans:
  - no, not yet.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because he can't keep a secret.

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:
  - uh, no, it just sort of happened.

  ans:
  - there's more to it than people think.

- que:
  - if you don't mind me asking, how is your sex life?
  ans:
  - i can't tell you that.

- que:
  - what's the big deal?
  ans:
  - i'm a professional.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - well, it all starts with a little bit of, uh, how shall i say, intimate contact.

- que:
  - but you have to promise that you don't tell grandpa jack anything, okay?
  ans:
  - all right.

  ans:
  - i don't know why people think they're fun.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - fun bolts.

- que:
  - 15, huh?
  ans:
  - genius.

- que:
  - jorge, what did i tell you?

  ans:
  - no one i know.

- que:
  - what the hell happened?
  ans:

- que:

  ans:
  - no monkey business?

- que:
  - what's happened to little jack?
  ans:
  - his hands are stuck to the bottle of rum.

- que:
  - and why are you wearing antlers?
  ans:
  - it's very complicated.

- que:
  - little jack, honey, are you okay?
  ans:
  - greg...

- que:
  - how's the little guy doing?
  ans:
  - everything is just as good as new.

- que:
  - is he all right?
  ans:
  - he's asleep.

- que:
  - what kind of sick cocktail were you gonna make my grandson?
  ans:
  - jack, the baby's teething.

- que:
  - it was your idea?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what is wrong with you people?
  ans:
  - i used to rub bourbon on denny's gums.

- que:
  - greg, you couldn't follow a simple set of instructions?
  ans:
  - jack, he was screaming.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - he's learning to self soothe.

  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - and i have news for you.

  - everybody just stop, okay?
  ans:
  - jack, i am not going to make any excuses.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:

  ans:
  - i think he did.

- que:
  - little jack, what did you just say?
  ans:
  - asshole.

- que:
  - his first word?
  ans:
  - it just slipped out of my mouth.

- que:
  - has greg ever mentioned the name jorge to you?
  ans:
  - jor...

- que:
  - no, why?
  ans:
  - because i think your fiance may have a few skeletons in his closet that he is not telling you about.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - he does not.

- que:
  - do you know that?
  ans:
  - yes, i know that.

- que:
  - how could i keep it a secret?
  ans:
  - he's so excited about being a grandpa.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - jack's really angry.

- que:
  - how often do we get to be grandparents?
  ans:
  - we're having a toast.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - we are honest people.

  - she thinks it'll break his heart if he finds out.

- que:
  - what's the matter what happened?
  ans:
  - i was, uh, coming to apologize and my back went into spasm.

  ans:

  ans:
  - it's not malloy.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - tell you what... you don't have to be a fed to read a flashing sign.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - maybe malloy was right about one of us not being a cop.

- que:
  - you were outside looking for tracks, right?
  ans:
  - right.

  ans:
  - guess my cover's finally blown.

  ans:
  - wait a minute.

- que:
  - and you said there were several masons signed it, yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - we could borrow it.
  ans:
  - then what do you propose we do?

- que:
  - steal it?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - look, ben...

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - we all have our areas of expertise.

  ans:
  - smuggler's hold.

- que:
  - then what are we gonna do?

- que:
  - is it really so hard to believe that someone's gonna try to steal the declaration of independence?
  ans:
  - the fbl gets 10, 000 tips a week.

- que:
  - but one step short of crazy, what do you get?
  ans:
  - obsessed.

- que:
  - mr. brown?
  ans:

  - pennsylvania dutch?
  ans:
  - oh, i am an american.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - they assured us that the declaration cannot possibly be stolen.

- que:
  - what do you think you're gonna find?
  ans:
  - we believe that there's an... encryption on the back.

- que:
  - an encryption, like a code?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - uh... a cartograph.

- que:
  - a map of what?
  ans:
  - the location of...... of hidden items of historic and intrinsic value.

- que:
  - a treasure map?
  ans:
  - that's where we lost the fbl.

- que:
  - you're treasure hunters, aren't you?
  ans:
  - we're more like treasure protectors.

- que:
  - what led you to assume there's this invisible map?
  ans:
  - we found an engraving on the stem of a 200 year old pipe.

- que:
  - may i see the pipe?
  ans:
  - uh, we don't have it.

- que:
  - did big foot take it?
  ans:
  - it was nice meeting you.

- que:
  - i was thinking, what if we go public, plaster the story all over the internet?
  ans:
  - it's not like we have our reputations to worry about.

- que:
  - beautiful, huh?
  ans:
  - no idea what you said.

- que:
  - go ahead.
  ans:
  - edison?

- que:
  - delicious jams and jellies?
  ans:

- que:
  - the gala, huh?
  ans:
  - this might be possible.

- que:
  - what have you got?
  ans:
  - the heat sensor went off in the declaration frame.

- que:
  - ben, are you sure that we should...?
  ans:
  - riley.

- que:
  - can you hear me?
  ans:
  - unfortunately. yeah.

- que:
  - how do you look?

  ans:
  - i made a last minute donation.

- que:
  - oh, you did get it?
  ans:

- que:
  - here, why don't you let me take that?
  ans:
  - so you can take that off his hands.

- que:
  - a toast, yeah?
  ans:
  - to high treason.

- que:
  - how does it look?
  ans:
  - it's working...

- que:

- que:
  - what do you got for me?
  ans:

  ans:
  - uh, no.

- que:
  - are you trying to steal that?
  ans:
  - oh, uh...

- que:
  - for this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - stop talking.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - it's a souvenir.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - stop chatting and get in the van.

- que:
  - did you enjoy the party?
  ans:
  - oh, bad.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i'm working on it.

- que:
  - why don't you just pass me that document?
  ans:
  - then we can all go home.

- que:
  - those lunatics...
  ans:
  - are you all right?

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - still a little on edge from being shot at, but i'll be ok.

- que:
  - you'd do well, dr. chase, to be a bit more civilized in this instance.
  ans:
  - see?

- que:
  - if this is the real one, what did they get?
  ans:
  - asouvenir.

- que:
  - who were those men?
  ans:
  - you're shouting again.

- que:
  - you have something?
  ans:
  - um...

- que:
  - do we have a namme on the tipster?
  ans:
  - there was no file opened.

- que:
  - how about now?
  ans:
  - there is not a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence.

- que:
  - you're that family with the conspiracy theory about the founding fathers?
  ans:
  - it's not a conspiracy theory.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i take it back.

- que:
  - there's a copy of the declaration on display now?
  ans:
  - the guards that were fired upon.

- que:
  - so... who was shooting, who were they shooting at, and why weren't they getting along?
  ans:
  - you can't seriously intend to run chemical tests on the declaration of independence in the back of a moving van.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - we can't go back there.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - this is the guy.

- que:
  - a credit card slip?
  ans:
  - dude, we're on the grid.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - we need those letters.

- que:
  - what letters?
  ans:
  - you know, get off the road, take a right.

- que:
  - did you steal those, too?
  ans:
  - we have scans of the originals.

- que:
  - how'd you get scans?
  ans:
  - oh, i know the person who has the originals.

- que:
  - she really can't shut her mouth, can she?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you what, look.

- que:
  - because it's immportant?
  ans:
  - because it's a namme.

- que:
  - well, how long do you think we got?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna give them a couple of hours at least.

- que:
  - what do we do about her?
  ans:
  - i've got some duct tape in the back.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - she's curious.

- que:
  - what in the world did this guy want to be when he grew up?
  ans:
  - we keep our focus on gates.

- que:
  - where's the party?
  ans:
  - uh, well, uh...

- que:
  - i look pregnant?
  ans:
  - this better not be about that dumb treasure.

- que:
  - and he dragged you two into this nonsense?
  ans:
  - literally.

- que:
  - him?
  ans:
  - look, if you just give us the letters, we're gone.

- que:
  - you mean she was a ship?
  ans:
  - yeah, she was beautiful.

  ans:
  - at least 200 years.

- que:

  ans:
  - i'mm fine.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - we need more juice.

- que:
  - is it?
  ans:
  - more clues.

- que:
  - are those latitudes and longitudes?
  ans:
  - that's why we need the silence dogood letters.

- que:
  - that's the key?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - will somebody please explain to me what these magic numbers are?
  ans:
  - it's an ottendorf cipher.

- que:
  - what's an ottendorf cipher?
  ans:
  - they're just codes.

- que:
  - so, dad, where are the letters?
  ans:
  - you know, it's just by sheer happenstance that his grandfather...

  ans:
  - one more dollar.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - so you show up at your father's door and say you're in trouble and the first thing he assumes is i'm pregnant.

- que:
  - is there a question in there?
  ans:
  - i think there's an interesting story in there.

- que:
  - more than one sommeone?
  ans:

  - i'd love to go shopping, too, but we have no money.

- que:
  - when are we gonna get there?
  ans:
  - i'm hungry.

- que:
  - you're sure this is right?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - one more dollar.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - so you show up at your father's door and say you're in trouble and the first thing he assumes is i'm pregnant.

- que:
  - is there a question in there?
  ans:
  - i think there's an interesting story in there.

- que:
  - more than one someone?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so you get your sense of absolute certainty from him, do you?
  ans:
  - well, i'm sure i don't know what you mean.

- que:
  - riley?
  ans:
  - oh, i got it.

- que:
  - did he talk to him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what was the secret?
  ans:
  - a treasure.

- que:
  - who's charlotte?
  ans:
  - oh, not even mr carroll knew that.

- que:
  - you know what that dollar represents?
  ans:
  - the entire gates family fortune.

- que:
  - do you want to be?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - do you so swear?
  ans:
  - i so swear.

- que:
  - can you imagine?
  ans:
  - it's extraordinary.

- que:
  - we getting closer?
  ans:
  - assuming ben's theory's correct and my tracking model's accurate, we should be getting very close.

- que:
  - shall we turn around and go home?
  ans:
  - or we could pull over and just throw him out here.

- que:
  - riley, you're not missing that little windowless cubicle we found you in?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - why are we stopping?
  ans:
  - i thought we were looking for a ship.

- que:
  - how could a ship wind up way out here?
  ans:
  - hello, beautiful.

- que:
  - do you think it's in the barrels?
  ans:
  - gunpowder.

- que:
  - is it a billion dollar pipe?
  ans:
  - it's a meerschaum pipe.

- que:
  - is it a million dollar pipe?
  ans:
  - no, it's a clue.

- que:
  - what legend?
  ans:
  - there's the legend of the templar treasure, and the stain effects the legend.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - the key in silence undetected.

- que:
  - but then why not say a pen?
  ans:
  - cos it's a prison.

- que:
  - and you said there were several masons signed it, yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - we could borrow it.
  ans:
  - then what do you propose we do?

- que:
  - steal it?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - look, ben...

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - we all have our areas of expertise.

- que:
  - you don't think mine are limited to writing cheques, do you?
  ans:
  - well, you can't shoot me.

- que:
  - what happens when the flare burns down?
  ans:
  - smuggler's hold.

- que:
  - then what are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - start making our way back home.

- que:
  - is it really so hard to believe that someone's gonna try to steal the declaration of independence?
  ans:
  - the fbi gets 10, 000 tips a week.

- que:
  - but one step short of crazy, what do you get?
  ans:
  - obsessed.

- que:
  - mr brown?
  ans:
  - the family name doesn't get a lot of respect in the academic community.

- que:
  - how may i help you?
  ans:
  - your accent.

- que:
  - pennsylvania dutch?
  ans:
  - saxony german.

- que:
  - you're not american?
  ans:
  - oh, i am an american.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - they assured us that the declaration cannot possibly be stolen.

- que:
  - what do you think you're gonna find?
  ans:
  - we believe that there's an... encryption on the back.

- que:
  - an encryption, like a code?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - a... cartograph.

- que:
  - a map of what?
  ans:
  - the location of...... of hidden items of historic and intrinsic value.

- que:
  - a treasure map?
  ans:
  - that's where we lost the fbl.

- que:
  - you're treasure hunters, aren't you?
  ans:
  - we're more like treasure protectors.

- que:
  - what led you to assume there's this invisible map?
  ans:
  - we found an engraving on the stem of a 200 year old pipe.

- que:
  - may i see the pipe?
  ans:
  - we don't have it.

- que:
  - did big foot take it?
  ans:
  - it was nice meeting you.

- que:
  - i was thinking, what if we go public, plaster the story all over the internet?
  ans:
  - it's not like we have our reputations to worry about.

- que:
  - beautiful, huh?
  ans:
  - no idea what you said.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna steal the declaration of independence.

- que:
  - ben?
  ans:
  - this is... huge.

- que:
  - you are gonna go to prison, you know that?
  ans:
  - yeah, probably.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - it's like stealing him.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because it's the biggest library in the world.

- que:
  - go ahead.
  ans:
  - edison?

- que:
  - delicious jams and jellies?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - the gala, huh?
  ans:
  - this might be possible.

- que:
  - what have you got?
  ans:
  - the heat sensor went off in the declaration frame.

- que:
  - ben, are you sure that we should...?
  ans:
  - riley.

- que:
  - can you hear me?
  ans:
  - unfortunately, yeah.

- que:
  - how do you look?
  ans:
  - not bad.

- que:
  - how does she look?
  ans:
  - i made a last minute donation.

- que:
  - oh, you did get it?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - here, why don't you let me take that?
  ans:
  - so you can take that off his hands.

- que:
  - a toast, yeah?
  ans:
  - to high treason.

- que:
  - how does it look?
  ans:
  - it's working...

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - in five, four, three...

- que:
  - what do you got for me?
  ans:
  - hit me with it.

- que:
  - can i marry your brain?
  ans:
  - we're in.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i lost my feed, ben.

- que:
  - is it heavy?
  ans:
  - shaw.

- que:
  - who's shooting?
  ans:
  - i'm in the elevator.

- que:
  - paul brown?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you trying to steal that?
  ans:
  - it's $35.

- que:
  - for this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - stop talking.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - it's a souvenir.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - stop chatting and get in the van.

- que:
  - did you enjoy the party?
  ans:
  - oh, bad.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i'm working on it.

- que:
  - why don't you just pass me that document?
  ans:
  - then we can all go home.

- que:
  - those lunatics...
  ans:
  - are you all right?

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - they don't have it.

- que:
  - you'd do well, dr chase, to be a bit more civilised in this instance.
  ans:
  - see?

- que:
  - if this is the real one, what did they get?
  ans:
  - a souvenir.

- que:
  - who were those men?
  ans:
  - you're shouting again.

- que:
  - you have something?
  ans:
  - um...

- que:
  - do we have a name on the tipster?
  ans:
  - there was no file opened.

- que:
  - how about now?
  ans:
  - there is not a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence.

- que:
  - you're that family with the conspiracy theory about the founding fathers?
  ans:
  - it's not a conspiracy theory.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i take it back.

- que:
  - there's a copy of the declaration on display now?
  ans:
  - yes, we decided to...

- que:
  - which guards?
  ans:
  - the guards that were fired upon.

- que:
  - so... who was shooting, who were they shooting at, and why weren't they getting along?
  ans:
  - you can't seriously intend to run chemical tests on the declaration of independence in the back of a moving van.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - we can't go back there.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - this is the guy.

- que:
  - a credit card slip?
  ans:
  - dude, we're on the grid.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - we need those letters.

- que:
  - what letters?
  ans:
  - you know, get off the road, take a right.

- que:
  - did you steal those, too?
  ans:
  - we have scans of the originals.

- que:
  - how'd you get scans?
  ans:
  - oh, i know the person who has the originals.

- que:
  - she really can't shut her mouth, can she?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you what, look.

- que:
  - because it's important?
  ans:
  - because it's a name.

- que:
  - well, how long do you think we got?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna give them a couple of hours at least.

- que:
  - what do we do about her?
  ans:
  - i've got some duct tape in the back.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - she's curious.

- que:
  - what in the world did this guy want to be when he grew up?
  ans:
  - we keep our focus on gates.

- que:
  - where's the party?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - i look pregnant?
  ans:
  - this better not be about that dumb treasure.

- que:
  - and he dragged you two into this nonsense?
  ans:
  - literally.

- que:
  - him?
  ans:
  - look, if you just give us the letters, we're gone.

- que:
  - you mean she was a ship?
  ans:
  - yeah, she was beautiful.

- que:
  - and the treasure?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - don't you get it, ben?
  ans:
  - i finally figured it out.

- que:
  - what am i doing?
  ans:
  - do what you want, ben.

- que:
  - how old is it?
  ans:
  - at least 200 years.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - pretty darn.

- que:
  - now if this thing's in invisible ink, how do we look at it?
  ans:
  - throw it in the oven.

- que:
  - why don't you get some rest?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - we need more juice.

- que:
  - is it?
  ans:
  - more clues.

- que:
  - are those latitudes and longitudes?
  ans:
  - that's why we need the silence dogood letters.

- que:
  - that's the key?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - will somebody please explain to me what these magic numbers are?
  ans:
  - it's an ottendorf cipher.

- que:
  - what's an ottendorf cipher?
  ans:
  - they're just codes.

- que:
  - so, dad, where are the letters?
  ans:
  - you know, it's just by sheer happenstance that his grandfather...

- que:
  - dad, where are the letters?
  ans:
  - i don't have them, son.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i don't have them.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - i donated them to the franklin institute in philadelphia.

- que:
  - oh, my god.
  ans:
  - the back of what?

- que:
  - what have you done?
  ans:
  - this is... this is the...

- que:
  - you stole it?
  ans:
  - dad, i can explain, but i don't have time.

- que:
  - would you?
  ans:
  - he tied me to a chair.

- que:
  - we look kind of conspicuous, don't you think?
  ans:
  - i'd love to go shopping, too, but we have no money.

- que:
  - when are we gonna get there?
  ans:
  - i'm hungry.

- que:
  - you're sure this is right?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - one more dollar.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - so you show up at your father's door and say you're in trouble and the first thing he assumes is i'm pregnant.

- que:
  - is there a question in there?
  ans:
  - i think there's an interesting story in there.

- que:
  - more than one someone?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so you get your sense of absolute certainty from him, do you?
  ans:
  - well, i'm sure i don't know what you mean.

- que:
  - riley?
  ans:
  - oh, i got it.

- que:
  - why do you have to do that?
  ans:
  - well, john pass and john stow cast the bell.

- que:
  - well, then, what does the rest of this mean?
  ans:
  - well, i thought the cipher was the map.

- que:
  - what time?
  ans:
  - wait a minute, wait.

- que:
  - excuse me, can i see one of those hundred dollar bills i paid you with?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do you see?
  ans:
  - 2:22.

- que:
  - what time is it now?
  ans:
  - almost three.

- que:
  - you don't know this?
  ans:
  - i i know something about history that you don't know.

- que:
  - is this how you feel all the time?
  ans:
  - because, you know...

- que:
  - do you actually know who the first person to suggest daylight savings was?
  ans:
  - benjamin franklin.

- que:
  - is this real?
  ans:
  - just tell me what you told my friend.

- que:
  - can you remember which ones you were gonna tell him next?
  ans:
  - yeah, here.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's not here.

- que:
  - what bell is this?
  ans:
  - it's the centennial bell.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - what'd you score?
  ans:
  - i found this.

- que:
  - so, what do we do with them?
  ans:
  - we look through it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's just that the last time this was here it was being signed.

- que:
  - is it a treasure map?
  ans:
  - take a look.

- que:
  - how'd they find us?
  ans:
  - well, lan has nearly unlimited resources.

- que:
  - so what do we do?
  ans:
  - we separate the lock from the key.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i'll take this.

- que:
  - like if we get caught and killed?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - who, baldy?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you want something?
  ans:
  - hiding.

- que:
  - have you seen this guy?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we lost it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we lost the declaration.

- que:
  - you both all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, we're all right.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - that's some story.

- que:
  - is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?
  ans:
  - someone's got to go to prison, ben.

- que:
  - so what are these for?
  ans:
  - it's a way to read the map.

- que:
  - so what'd it say?
  ans:
  - nothing else.

- que:
  - are we set?
  ans:
  - checking source.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - um, chained to a desk.

- que:
  - you know where that is?
  ans:
  - new york.

- que:
  - can i get a status report?
  ans:
  - crow's nest in position.

- que:
  - are you with me?
  ans:
  - well, i'm sure not against you, if that's what you're asking.

- que:
  - sound familiar?
  ans:
  - keep sightlines clear.

- que:
  - what's the devil's going on?
  ans:
  - there's a lot of commotion.

- que:
  - gates?
  ans:
  - air tour helicopter, you are in controlled airspace.

- que:
  - who's got gates?
  ans:
  - all agents, report in.

- que:
  - did gates speak to anybody?
  ans:
  - target is moving.

- que:
  - anyone got a view of our friend lan howe?
  ans:
  - lan howe is not at the stern, sir.

- que:
  - then why is he heading there?
  ans:
  - he's at the observation deck.

- que:
  - he set us up.
  ans:
  - what's he talking about?

- que:
  - can you see gates in the water?
  ans:
  - sir, it's the hudson.

- que:
  - what'd you do with abigail and riley?
  ans:
  - hope these fit.

- que:
  - i said, what'd you do with abigail and riley?
  ans:
  - he's the only one who could've told you that line about edison.

- que:
  - did you bring the glasses?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how's your day going?
  ans:
  - uh, interesting, dear.

- que:
  - so, what, you working with lan now?
  ans:
  - it turns out helping someone escape from fbi custody is a criminal act.

- que:
  - i mean you're safe?
  ans:
  - yeah, we both are.

- que:
  - and where is that?
  ans:
  - right across the street from where we're hiding, at the intersection of wall street and broadway.

- que:
  - no broken bones?
  ans:
  - a jump like that could kill a man.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - where's my treasure?
  ans:
  - it's right here.

- que:
  - is that all the map said?
  ans:
  - every word.

- que:
  - you know the key to running a convincing bluff?
  ans:
  - every once in a while you've got to be holding all the cards.

- que:
  - is there anything else you want to tell me?
  ans:
  - trinity church.

- que:
  - well, why don't you ask dr chase and riley to join us?
  ans:
  - i'm sure they're around here somewhere.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i'm a hostage.

- que:
  - what's the purpose?
  ans:
  - just another clue.

- que:
  - a street inside the church?
  ans:
  - not inside.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - i'm still working on it.

- que:
  - who wants to go down the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - you got a light?
  ans:
  - careful.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - it's a chandelier.

- que:
  - how do a bunch of guys with hand tools build all this?
  ans:
  - same way they built the pyramids and the great wall of china.

- que:
  - what are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - i'm not going out on that thing.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - subway.

- que:
  - do you trust me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i would have dropped you both.

- que:
  - do you imagine any one of your lives is more valuable to me than shaw's?
  ans:
  - we go on.

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - this is...

- que:
  - we came all this way for a dead end?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - hm?
  ans:
  - you know where it is.

- que:
  - lan, why don't you come back down here and we can talk through this together?
  ans:
  - don't speak again.

- que:
  - ben?
  ans:
  - the lantern.

- que:
  - and what does it mean?
  ans:
  - boston.

- que:
  - so you can escape in boston?
  ans:
  - besides, with you out of the picture there's less baggage to carry.

- que:
  - what if there's another clue?
  ans:
  - then i'll know right where to find you.

- que:
  - ok, boys, what's going on?
  ans:
  - the british came by sea.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - through the treasure room.

- que:
  - now, ben, where is this other way out?
  ans:
  - well, that's it.

- que:
  - could it really be that simple?
  ans:
  - the secret lies with charlotte.

- que:
  - could this be possible?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - just like that?
  ans:
  - just like that.

- que:
  - you do know you just handed me your biggest bargaining chip?
  ans:
  - the declaration of independence is not a bargaining chip.

- que:
  - i take it you found the treasure?
  ans:
  - it's about five stories beneath your shoes.

- que:
  - and what about you?
  ans:
  - i'd really love not to go to prison.

- que:
  - what do you care?
  ans:
  - you got the girl.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - a map.

- que:
  - where does it lead to?
  ans:
  - sell your farm... come with me to the city.

- que:
  - couldn't she get drowned?
  ans:
  - ... then overturn the boat... it will look like an accident.

- que:
  - nice job.
  ans:
  - wilt thou love her?

- que:
  - timothy treadwell is crazy about grizzly bears.
  ans:
  - i gotta think, he was over ten feet high, don't you?

- que:
  - how crazy?
  ans:
  - sometimes...

- que:
  - and you want to go and put yourself in harm's way 24 hours a day?
  ans:
  - i think they've been misunderstood.

- que:
  - what do you think, olie?
  ans:
  - i think if you were weak around him, you're going down his gullet, going down the pipe.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - don't you do that.

- que:
  - just as long as the donations keep coming, furthering the antihuman eco religion as a noble cause, who cares about reality?
  ans:
  - another one.

- que:
  - that's where you're sitting?
  ans:
  - there.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - you're such a good champion.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - because i'm on my way to the gri zz ly ma z e where bears do not have human protection, but are under human threat.

- que:
  - hey, who's stealing that hat?
  ans:
  - let me see that hat.

- que:
  - ghost, what are you doing with that hat?
  ans:
  - that hat is so frigging valuable for this trip.

- que:
  - ghost, where's that hat?
  ans:
  - it's not okay for you to steal it.

- que:
  - and how do you see timothy treadwell's story?
  ans:
  - i see it as something that's both...

- que:
  - but he tried to protect the bears, didn't he?
  ans:
  - i think he did more damage to the bears than he did...

- que:
  - can you speak about amie?
  ans:
  - amie was brave and amie was strong.

- que:
  - do i feel like his widow?
  ans:
  - yeah, you know, in some ways i do.

- que:
  - you also founded a foundation with him?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and who do i see when i sit down in the office, waiting like you're in the jail or you're in the principal's office?
  ans:
  - i see timothy treadwell.

- que:
  - does that feel good?
  ans:
  - we patrol the gri zz ly sanctuary together.

- que:
  - how did we meet?
  ans:
  - over a decade ago.

- que:
  - don't you think?
  ans:
  - if they knew how beautiful he was, and how sweet he was, they would never hurt him.

- que:
  - can i take it?
  ans:
  - i'm trying.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i mean it's not... it's not that i'm a total great guy.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - gay guys have no problem.

- que:
  - but you know what?
  ans:
  - alas, timothy treadwell is not gay.

- que:
  - did you ever get the story?
  ans:
  - i was troubled.

- que:
  - did you know that?
  ans:
  - you wouldn't even know what that is.

- que:
  - oh, duhl right?
  ans:
  - you get pretty lonely.

- que:
  - and what happened to you?
  ans:
  - jewel, you must never listen to this.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - what drove timothy into the wild?
  ans:
  - we visited his parents in florida.

- que:
  - i'm sure he loved it to the end, you know?
  ans:
  - it's just... his childhood toy.

- que:
  - how close a second?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how's the hair look?
  ans:
  - at some point in timmy's life, he had a near fatal overdose.

- que:
  - that he didn't tell you the truth about his accent or his origins?
  ans:
  - he was troubled.

- que:
  - how dangerous?
  ans:
  - i mean...

- que:
  - isn't this... so sad?
  ans:
  - this is a bumblebee who expired as it was working at doing the pollen thing on this alaskan fireweed.

- que:
  - was it sleeping?
  ans:
  - the storm's gonna go on and on and on.

- que:
  - through our research, we found that you can harvest about 6  of the population annually and still have a healthy group of bears.
  ans:
  - that's a pretty good idea, huh?

- que:
  - and poaching?
  ans:
  - poaching is not as big a concern around here as it has been in russia, for instance, and some other locations.

- que:
  - don't you?
  ans:
  - yeah, i'm the big cra z y guy with the... or the skinny cra z y guy with the camouflage makeup on.

- que:
  - and what else is in there?
  ans:
  - there's a little bit of lupin, there's a little bit of iris.

- que:
  - where did you get the bear fur?
  ans:
  - we picked it up off the ground.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - we are at a campsite where timothy last camped.

- que:
  - am i a great person?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - could this one be bear 141?
  ans:
  - what looks playful could be desperation.

- que:
  - the best time i ever had with my father... was when he was having maybe the worst time of his life.
  ans:
  - is amie trying to get out of the shot?

- que:
  - go figure, right?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - well, did you do your reading?
  ans:

- que:
  - murdered?
  ans:

  - no.

- que:
  - can i ask how.. how i left?

- que:
  - i mean, how could she even know you?
  ans:
  - she was unconscious the entire time.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - she had an out of body experience before jim brought her back.

- que:
  - small business assessment?
  ans:
  - this is like 3 times what i thought it was gonna be.

- que:
  - how did you do that?
  ans:
  - tell her i'm here now.

- que:
  - you mean like ghosts?
  ans:
  - i don't know if they actually told you, but you... you died, only for a few seconds while my husband was working on you.

  - how?
  ans:
  - it's a long story.

- que:
  - you said there was one more thing you need to do before you could go. what is it?

  - it might sound kind of morbid.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i'v... i've... i've got to see what kind of person is..

- que:
  - like waxing and cleaning it?
  ans:
  - no.

  - if gwen gets better, if i feel she is taken care of... then you'll go?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - does he dim the lights sometimes, too?
  ans:
  - they can also use their energy to affect electricity if they try really hard.

- que:
  - it's time for him to go.
  ans:
  - how do you know all this?

- que:
  - did i tell you he used to read to me if i couldn't fall asleep?
  ans:
  - there will never be anybody else like him, not for me.

- que:
  - how come a ghost would know where his heart went?
  ans:
  - probably because he went straight to gwen when he died.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - well, maybe a recipient doesn't want to know where his organ came from especially a heart.

- que:
  - it's just, the information is for someone very... are you family?
  ans:
  - well, in the family of man sense, i guess.

- que:
  - can you at least give me cities and initials?
  ans:
  - this isn't jeopardy!.

- que:
  - can you help me?
  ans:
  - donor's name... date of death... and the code r w h o d.

- que:
  - you can go now, if that's what you mean?
  ans:
  - damn.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - it sounded like the truth.

- que:
  - studying what?
  ans:
  - the impact on people with things like this.

- que:
  - things like?
  ans:
  - transplants.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - ask me if i feel guilty because some guy i didn't know is dead and i'm here, talking to you about it.

- que:
  - well, what did you expect?
  ans:
  - i expected somebody filled with joy about having a new lease on life.

- que:
  - hey, how's gwen?
  ans:
  - feeling better.

- que:
  - let's not ever take that for granted, ok?
  ans:
  - deal.

- que:
  - i mean, wouldn't you want the same thing for me if something happened to you?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - out of the question.
  ans:
  - sure i would, ok?

- que:
  - how did i snag such a sensitive, modern man?
  ans:

  ans:
  - who could have done this?

- que:
  - i don't know anybody who has this kind of money and how would they know?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i think you owe me an explanation.

  ans:
  - we had a deal.

  - but it's my favorite game.

- que:
  - is that all?
  ans:
  - then you missed the good part.

- que:

  - i told you to stay in new mecca.

- que:
  - did you not listen?
  ans:
  - i had mercs on my neck.

- que:

  - it's moving in the right direction.

- que:
  - take a look.
  ans:
  - riddick?

- que:
  - because anatoli says so?
  ans:
  - because his nose says so.

- que:
  - you don't care if you live or die?
  ans:
  - there it is.

- que:
  - we gonna do this or not?
  ans:
  - let's play.

- que:
  - kyra?
  ans:
  - i was supposed to deliver a message to you... if vaako failed to kill you.

- que:
  - where will they take her?
  ans:
  - we all began... as something else.

- que:
  - and if you say it is certain, then it is certain, and we've already said it, haven't we?
  ans:
  - we have.

- que:
  - shouldn't i tell you that riddick is still alive?
  ans:
  - mind fabricates fear.

- que:
  - not only your failure, but now the report of success.
  ans:
  - could you be wrong?

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - lord marshal's got to be warned.

- que:
  - just to keep what i kill?
  ans:
  - that is the necromonger way.

- que:
  - but after a while, the pain goes away, just as they promise.
  ans:
  - are they leaving now?

- que:
  - are you with me, kyra?
  ans:
  - there's a moment... when you can almost see the underverse through his eyes.

- que:
  - are you with me, kyra?
  ans:
  - convert now... or fall forever.

- que:
  - vaako?
  ans:
  - i thought you were dead.

- que:

  - secret?
  ans:

  ans:
  - forget it.

- que:
  - don't you see?
  ans:
  - you're a cripple now.

- que:

  - and he's taunting the cop, right?
  ans:
  - sending clues who his next victim is.

- que:
  - it's a little obvious, don't you think?
  ans:
  - okay, but here's the twist.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - see, he's actually really the cop and the girl.

- que:

  ans:
  - because i wanted there to be more tension.

- que:
  - but are you changing...?
  ans:
  - keeps more tension.

- que:

  ans:
  - i really like it.

- que:

  - what happened then?
  ans:
  - the man was burnt at stake... and i'm still alive.

- que:
  - then tell me... who, among your brethren, is the heretic responsible for these murders?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - did i lie awake that night, suffering for the girl... or formyself?
  ans:
  - i did not know.

- que:
  - did christ or did he not owe... the clothes that he wore?
  ans:
  - beloved brethren of the franciscan order... our holly father, the pope, has authorized me... and these servants to speak on his behalf.

- que:
  - can't you show a little pity?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - my heart is full of sorrow... but i can't find no reason to contest... the just sentence of the holly lnquisition.
  ans:
  - to remember that you once looted and burnt the property ofthe church?

- que:
  - and you, william of baskerville?
  ans:
  - yes, he is guilty.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know why.

- que:
  - because you were inspired by the devil?
  ans:
  - yes... that's it.

- que:
  - it's brother malachia, father.
  ans:
  - who told you?

- que:
  - malachia?
  ans:
  - william of baskerville was right.

- que:
  - remember the inscription ofthe mirror?
  ans:
  - we had to press above the idol.

- que:
  - so now, what's it that you want?
  ans:
  - i want to see the book in greek you said was never written.

- que:
  - why does this one fill you with such fear?
  ans:
  - because it's by aristotle.

- que:
  - do you, salvatore, renounce the devil and embrace jesus christ... as your lord and savior?
  ans:
  - do you, remigio de veragine, renounce the devil...

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - it's better die fast than to spend... the rest of life in prison.

- que:
  - but what's so alarming about laughter?
  ans:
  - laughter kills fear... and without fear there can't be faith.

- que:
  - can we laugh at god?
  ans:
  - the world would be back to chaos.

- que:
  - should we tell him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - but... what if he learns it of his own account?
  ans:
  - you're overestimating his talents.

- que:
  - what's your opinion, venerable jorge?
  ans:
  - dear brothers...

- que:
  - adso?
  ans:
  - yes, master.

- que:
  - to command nature... one must learn to obey it, huh?
  ans:
  - so, return to the court, turn the building on your left... enter the court on you right.

- que:
  - the other delegates have arrived?
  ans:
  - ubertino de casale has been here for some weeks... the others are due tomorrow.

- que:
  - you're not in need of anything?
  ans:
  - no, thank you.

- que:
  - you knew him?
  ans:
  - no, but i knew and admired his work.

- que:
  - brother william... may i speak to you candidly?
  ans:
  - you seem anxious to do so.

- que:
  - somebody told you?
  ans:
  - there was something feminine... something diabolical... about the young one who died.

- que:
  - she's beautiful, isn't she?
  ans:
  - when a female... by nature so perverted... becomes sublime by holiness... then she can be the noble vehicle of grace.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i find it thrillingly.

- que:
  - what if it wasn't that tower he fell from... but somewhere over there and the body rolled all the way down here?
  ans:
  - no devil needed anymore.

- que:
  - are you paying attention?
  ans:
  - yes, he jumped.

- que:
  - why else would someone go up there in the middle of a rainstorm?
  ans:
  - not to admire the landscape.

- que:
  - and then towed all the way up there with the body?
  ans:
  - much easier to get rid of it through that small door.

- que:
  - have you ever known a place where god would've felt at home?
  ans:
  - we praise our lord that the debate... we are so greatly honored to host... may now proceed without a shadow of fear.

- que:
  - were you not always a monk?
  ans:
  - even monks have past, adso.

- que:
  - do you apply arsenic in many circumstances?
  ans:
  - yes, indeed.

- que:
  - and what if not in so small doses?
  ans:
  - death.

- que:
  - what was his function here?
  ans:
  - he was our finest translator of greek.

- que:
  - was he in friendly terms with the handsome adelmo?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - but in a brotherly way understand?
  ans:
  - not like...

- que:
  - contemplating my sanctuary?
  ans:
  - there, we have the devil.

- que:
  - master, what language was he speaking?
  ans:
  - all languages and none.

- que:
  - what does it mean?
  ans:
  - that the hunchback, undoubtedly... was once a herectic.

- que:
  - who were they?
  ans:
  - those who believed in the poverty of christ.

- que:
  - so, could he not have killed the translator?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do you mean from these footprints here?
  ans:
  - or because he was carrying another man.

- que:
  - where did the erudite greek translator... meet the anonymous author of his death?
  ans:
  - brother librarian... perhaps you'd permit us to examine the work of the two unfortunates... who were so distressingly gone to god.

- que:
  - can you be so sure?
  ans:
  - there's nothing in the scriptures to say that he did.

- que:
  - have you read this work?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - which was the greek translator's desk?
  ans:
  - this one.

- que:
  - what'd you deduce from that visit?
  ans:
  - that we're not meant to laugh in there.

- que:
  - but you noticed how few books there were on the escritoire's shelves?
  ans:
  - all those scriveners, copyists, translators, researchers... thinkers...

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - with all due respect... it seems that whenever you ask me a question, you already have the answer.

- que:
  - do you know where the books are?
  ans:
  - no, but i've faith that that tower contains something other than air.

- que:
  - just as i thought, it must be bolted from inside.
  ans:
  - did you see the little door the librarian closed as we came in?

- que:
  - how do we get in?
  ans:
  - obviously, there must be another entrance.

- que:
  - who's there?
  ans:
  - my magnifying glasses...

- que:
  - are you afraid of me?
  ans:
  - i'll find you.

- que:
  - who was this creature that rose like the dawn... bewitched as the moon, radiant as the sun.. terrible as an army poised for battle?
  ans:
  - good evening, salvatore.

- que:
  - do you like?
  ans:
  - thank you, no.

- que:
  - so adelmo gave the parchment to berengar?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i found another one.
  ans:
  - what happened then?

- que:
  - have you ever met anyone with a rib cage large enough to accommodate... a heart ofthose dimensions?
  ans:
  - this is the heart of an ox.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the one i saw out of here.

- que:
  - why ugly?
  ans:
  - if he'd been young and beautiful, she'd have blessed him... with her carnal favors for nothing.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - nothing, master.

- que:
  - master?
  ans:
  - there's something i must tell you.

- que:
  - then, you'll hear my confession?
  ans:
  - i'd rather you told me first as a friend.

- que:
  - in love?
  ans:
  - many times.

- que:
  - you were?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - am l?
  ans:
  - you are in love.

- que:
  - is that bad?
  ans:
  - for a monk it presents certain problems.

- que:
  - but doesn't st thomas aquinas praise love above all the virtues?
  ans:
  - of woman, thomas aquinas knew very little.

- que:
  - yes, but what do you think, master?
  ans:
  - he's probably hiding somewhere... with the book and my magnifying glasses.

- que:
  - i was looking for brother berengar.
  ans:
  - brother berengar?

- que:
  - is he here?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you know where we might find him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - or is he perhaps upstairs, in the library?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - may i do so?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - it's strict order of the abbot.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the third trumpet... as ubertino said.

- que:
  - is it a chicken for you?
  ans:
  - it's more like a sparrow.

- que:
  - what if ubertino's right and you're wrong?
  ans:
  - this debate's crucial to us all. we suspect the pope wants to crash our order.

- que:
  - did you find a book in greek?
  ans:
  - i was right.

- que:
  - he was left handed?
  ans:
  - brother berengar was inverted in many ways.

- que:
  - are there other left handed brothers at the abbey?
  ans:
  - not that i know.

- que:
  - you see how the calligraphy changes?
  ans:
  - from this point on, he was dying.

- que:
  - how do we know that?
  ans:
  - because those notes overrun...

- que:
  - what kind of secret knowledge would he not have privilege?
  ans:
  - i feel you're about to tell me.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - there was a witness.

- que:
  - alone.
  ans:
  - master, who's bernardo gui?

- que:
  - you know who's coming?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - wasn't your vanity, your intellectual pride... that brought you into conflict with bernardo gui before?
  ans:
  - do not dare fate twice, william.

- que:
  - and now?
  ans:
  - now that lsaw herin the midst ofherpovertyandsquatter...

- que:
  - which one frightens you most?
  ans:
  - they all do.

- que:
  - but how to reach the library?
  ans:
  - it's cheap...

- que:
  - know what he said?
  ans:
  - it's a miracle...

- que:
  - oh, it's a waste of time.
  ans:
  - what do they want?

- que:
  - i can't live without you.
  ans:
  - why don't you clear off?

- que:
  - what shall i do if you leave me?
  ans:
  - i'm begging you not to leave me.

- que:
  - have you seen other people on this island?
  ans:
  - no, i am not.

- que:
  - who is?
  ans:
  - there is no commanding officer here.

- que:
  - formally?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you know him?
  ans:
  - yes, he was our commanding officer.

- que:
  - you know where he is?
  ans:
  - when the bombing started, he fled to hillah.

- que:
  - hillah, huh?
  ans:
  - yes, that is right.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - there.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:

  ans:
  - looking for you.

- que:
  - where are we going?
  ans:
  - you said you were looking for me.

- que:

  ans:
  - i was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - we need to keep moving.

- que:

  ans:
  - to become successful actresses you have to learn how to smoke them.

  - why would we want to watch a porno?
  ans:
  - besides, we have to teach randa about sex, and this is the best way to learn.

- que:
  - would you please stop criticizing everything in my big bag of fun?
  ans:
  - i spent a lot of time putting this together.

- que:
  - you didn't hear about it?
  ans:
  - some kid in a private school in bel air just walked into his cafeteria... with an assault rifle and opened fire.

  - are you here to help me change the oil?
  ans:
  - you know, i could never give up men, because i like cock too much.

  - i wonder why that is?
  ans:
  - i'm finished.

- que:

- que:
  - what about him?
  ans:
  - he's done stuff to all three of us.

- que:

  ans:
  - we have to stick together, no matter what.

- que:
  - how are we going to afford a lawyer, on what we make?

  ans:
  - so, technically, i'm licensed to practice law in the state of california.

- que:
  - what's the point?
  ans:
  - nobody's going to believe me.

- que:
  - what kind of attitude is that?
  ans:
  - i already have a foolproof strategy.

- que:
  - i saw this in a movie once, all right?
  ans:
  - look, we say one of your arms is dead... useless.

- que:
  - well, which hand did you grope them with?
  ans:

  ans:
  - enough of that already.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i saw her.

- que:
  - can you believe this all started out as a wimpy little special interest feature?
  ans:
  - they give me fluff, and i turn it into dirt.

- que:
  - you know what that is?
  ans:
  - it's hot.

- que:
  - but let me ask you something, is any of it true?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't perjure myself, mr. nicholl, not for any reason.

- que:
  - would you care to recount this incident to the court?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - could you hear what we were saying?

  - i mean, where is it?
  ans:
  - she can't show me.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - well, forgive me, but you were kind of tempting fate... by putting israel next to palestine.

- que:
  - i mean, what kind of fucking diplomacy is that?
  ans:
  - god help us if you ever become un leader.

- que:
  - what are you laughing at, sudan?
  ans:
  - and, josh, at least my dad isn't a money grubbing jew shyster... who lets criminals go free.

- que:
  - can you tell us, say, about a typical complaint you might field from a parent?

- que:
  - kimberly, is there anything that you'd like to tell mr. horowitz?
  ans:
  - i don't know what came over me.

- que:
  - always starts with the parents, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - but still, i do think that you owe mr. horowitz an apology.

- que:
  - potato latke?
  ans:
  - too fattening.

- que:
  - why don't you two just hurry on back to class now?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, kimberly, my hands are tied on this one.

- que:
  - do you know what it was?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - come on, do you really expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - i'm not going to forget this.

- que:
  - didn't it make you angry... when mr. anderson told you he was replacing you with brittany wells?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you don't know?
  ans:
  - look at that, she doesn't know.

- que:
  - didm't you want to get back at him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and that you thought that the play might even bring you closer to him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - isn't this correct, miss joyce?
  ans:
  - yes, that's correct.

- que:
  - do me a favor, would you?
  ans:
  - read that out loud to the court.

- que:
  - embarrassed?
  ans:
  - well, well, well.

- que:
  - why are you embarrassed, kimberly?
  ans:
  - i wanted to get it done quickly, and i didn't do a very good job.

- que:
  - can i go?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - can i go?
  ans:
  - one moment, your honor.

- que:
  - what the fuck was that supposed to prove?
  ans:
  - it wasn't anything like that.

- que:
  - would you read that again, please?
  ans:
  - and this time i'd love for you to do it seductively.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - just try to make the words sexy.

- que:
  - mr. nicholl?
  ans:
  - some leeway, please, your honor.

- que:
  - miss joyce, would you please try and do what he asks?
  ans:
  - please, i appreciate that.

- que:
  - are you all right, dear?
  ans:
  - bet you've never seen one like that before.

- que:
  - it is?
  ans:
  - yes, and you're cute.

- que:
  - i am?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so did you ask him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you want to make me happy, don't you, josh?
  ans:
  - of course i do, you're amazing.

- que:
  - miss azzouni, now... you were also present at this detention in question, were you not?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - another room?
  ans:
  - there is a small room beside mr. andersors classroom... separated by glass.

- que:
  - now, what are we going to do about that?
  ans:
  - i'm going to let you in on a little secret.

- que:
  - you're sitting there, loathing me right now, aren't you?
  ans:
  - because good grades are very important to your parents.

- que:
  - what are we going to do about that?
  ans:
  - if your compositional skills don't improve within the next year...

- que:
  - do i make myself clear?
  ans:
  - look at me.

- que:
  - and do you recall any of the details of this discussion?
  ans:
  - i do not recollect the details.

- que:
  - mr. anderson said to you during that discussion, anything at all?
  ans:
  - well, one thing i remember is that he told an off color joke.

- que:
  - an off color joke?
  ans:
  - mr. anderson told you an off color joke.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - she lies upon the bed, he ejaculates upon the wall.

- que:
  - and what happened next, miss azzouni?
  ans:
  - now i'm going to touch you on your boobs.

- que:
  - good stuff.
  ans:
  - boobs?

- que:
  - miss azzouni, engage me here a little bit here, would you?
  ans:
  - i'm just curious.

- que:
  - which hand did mr. anderson allegedly fondle you with?
  ans:
  - both hands.

- que:
  - both hands?
  ans:
  - no more questions.

- que:
  - well, all you got to do is tell the truth, right?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - so what's there to be nervous about?
  ans:
  - kimberly and randa, they already did a good job on the stand.

- que:
  - look, i'm not kimberly, okay?
  ans:
  - this whole thing is really scary for me, with the judge and all the lawyers.

- que:
  - what?

  ans:
  - no, it's not even close.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - well, i heard something... that kind of freaked me out... and to be honest with you, it was kind of making me look bad.

- que:
  - you don't like what you see?
  ans:
  - warren prescott told me what he did to you.

- que:
  - are you going to believe everything that warren says?
  ans:
  - i believe this.

- que:
  - assuming that it's true... why is that a problem?

  ans:
  - and i don't want to be with some dirty little whore.

- que:
  - what did you say to me?
  ans:
  - you heard me.

- que:

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - kimberly, hi, it's barry.

- que:
  - how can i put this tactfully?
  ans:

  - the rest of his life?
  ans:
  - brittany, don't pussy out on me.

- que:
  - will mr. anderson be fired?

  - what kind of person are you?
  ans:
  - but the thing in drama, that was true.

  - mad?
  ans:
  - i don't want to look at you anymore.

  - you wanna just crawl in the dirt and stay there... where no one can see, don't you?
  ans:
