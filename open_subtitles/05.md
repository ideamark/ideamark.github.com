  - what's mole's story?
  ans:
  - sound off.

- que:
  - maybe i should do this later, huh?
  ans:
  - if we could blow the top off of that thing, we'd have a straight shot to the surface.

- que:
  - who are these guys?
  ans:
  - they gotta be atlanteans.

- que:
  - dices linguam romae.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - pardon, mademoiselle?
  ans:
  - on behalf of my crew... may i say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city.

- que:
  - commander?
  ans:
  - you presume much... to think you are welcome here.

- que:
  - may i respectfully request that we stay one night, sir?
  ans:
  - that would give us time to rest, resupply... and be ready to travel by morning.

- que:
  - so, how'd it go?
  ans:
  - well, the king and his daughter don't exactly see eye to eye.

- que:
  - you are a scholar, are you not?
  ans:
  - judging from your diminished physique... and large forehead... you are suited for nothing else.

- que:
  - when did the flood waters recede?
  ans:
  - how did you wait a minute.

- que:
  - so let's do this, ok?
  ans:
  - you ask one, then i'll ask one... then you, then me, then...

- que:
  - well, ok, uh, how did you get here?
  ans:
  - well, i mean, not you personally... but your your culture.

- que:
  - i mean, how did all of this end up down here?
  ans:
  - no, that that's impossible... because, i mean, that would make you... you know, 8, 500 8, 800 years old.

- que:
  - you got another question for me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how is it you found your way to this place?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, i can read atlantean, just like you.

- que:
  - you can't, can you?
  ans:
  - no one can.

- que:
  - how was my accent?
  ans:
  - boorish, provincial... and you speak it through your nose.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - ye no.

- que:
  - so, who's hungry?
  ans:
  - by the way, we were never properly introduced.

- que:
  - uh, hey, you got a nickname?
  ans:
  - kida.

- que:
  - what is wrong?
  ans:
  - oh, it's nothing.

- que:

  - no, that's sweet.

- que:
  - what is?
  ans:
  - the doctor.

- que:
  - his name is kindly?
  ans:
  - no, sweet.

- que:
  - so all of your doctors are sweet and kindly?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and the little digging animal called mole... he is your pet?
  ans:
  - close enough.

- que:
  - you do swim, do you not?
  ans:
  - oh, i swim pretty girl.

- que:
  - the star in the middle of the city.
  ans:
  - are you all right?

- que:
  - what does the writing say about that?
  ans:
  - the power source i've been looking for... the bright light you remember...

- que:
  - then where is it now?
  ans:
  - i don't know, i don't know.

- que:
  - guys?
  ans:
  - i am such an idiot.

- que:
  - oh, you mean this?
  ans:
  - besides, you're the one who got us here.

- que:
  - what's to know?
  ans:
  - it's big.

- que:
  - helga, what do you think?
  ans:
  - knowing that, i'd double the price.

- que:
  - where's the crystal chamber?
  ans:
  - you will destroy yourselves.

- que:
  - all right, thatch, what's next?
  ans:
  - ok, there's a giant crystal... hovering 150 feet above our heads... over a bottomless pit of water.

- que:
  - doesn't anything surprise you?
  ans:
  - the only thing that surprises me...

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - look, all it says here... is that the crystal is alive somehow.

- que:
  - what did she say?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i guess this is how it ends, huh?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - but that's what it's all about, right?
  ans:
  - money.

- que:
  - how's he doing?
  ans:
  - not good, i'm afraid.

- que:
  - where is my daughter?
  ans:
  - well, she she...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - in times of danger... the crystal will choose a host... one of royal blood... to protect itself... and its people.

- que:
  - so this thing is alive?
  ans:
  - in a way.

- que:
  - what's going to happen to kida?
  ans:
  - if she remains bonded to the crystal... she could be lost to it forever.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - return the crystal.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - i followed you in, and i'll follow you out.

- que:
  - oh, my decision?
  ans:
  - well, you did set the camp on fire... and drop us down that big hole.

- que:
  - who told you that?
  ans:
  - a fella by the name of thaddeus thatch.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i'm going after rourke.

- que:

  ans:
  - just follow my lead.

- que:

  ans:
  - all you got to do is use the crystals.

  - any last words?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - in a way.

- que:
  - what's going to happen to kida?

- que:
  - i've missed our conversations.
  ans:
  - and guess who else?

  - i hear i am to congratulate you on your forthcoming betrothal to miss king?
  ans:

  - observe that closet, cousin elizabeth.
  ans:
  - all of it?

- que:
  - what do you say to that?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - is it not the very essence of practicality and convenience?
  ans:
  - lady catherine de bourgh herself was kind enough to suggest that these shelves be fitted.

- que:
  - nothing is too small to be beneath her notice, is it not, my dear?
  ans:
  - she is a very attentive neighbour.

- que:
  - that is generosity itself, is it not, maria?
  ans:
  - her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.

- que:
  - is that necessary?
  ans:
  - perhaps not, but i confess i encourage him in that as well.

- que:
  - and you prefer to sit in this parlour?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - who, lizzy?
  ans:
  - mark the windows.

  ans:
  - yes, ma'am, all of them.

- que:
  - your youngest sisters must be very young?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am, my youngest is not sixteen.

- que:
  - sir william, wouldn't you agree?
  ans:
  - with three younger sisters grown up, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.

- que:
  - i could grow almost as fond of these woods and hills as you have.
  ans:
  - mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalf's calling on me yesterday to thank me for sending her miss pope?

- que:
  - at last, sir?
  ans:
  - i've heard much of you, and the praise hasn't been exaggerated.

- que:
  - this you do not find at rosings park?
  ans:
  - my aunt does talk a great deal, but seldom requires a response.

- que:
  - i believe you play and sing?
  ans:
  - a little, and very ill.

- que:
  - what do you think offends him?
  ans:
  - i hope your family is in good health.

- que:
  - have you not seen her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why should you be?
  ans:
  - i always believe in first impressions, and his good opinion once lost, is lost forever.

- que:
  - so you see, it is a hopeless case, is it not, colonel fitzwilliam?
  ans:
  - you will never play really well, miss bennet, unless you practise more.

- que:
  - do you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?
  ans:
  - i won't be alarmed.

- que:
  - i'm not afraid of you.
  ans:
  - that is ungenerous of him, is it not?

- que:
  - i fear i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.
  ans:
  - what can you accuse him of?

- que:
  - why a man of sense and education, who has lived in the world, should be ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - i was just writing a letter to my sister jane in london.
  ans:
  - what are you talking of?

- que:
  - mr bingley and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?
  ans:
  - perfectly so, i thank you.

- que:
  - i understand mr bingley has not much idea for ever returning to netherfield?
  ans:
  - it is probable that he may spend little time there in the future.

- que:
  - what is fifty miles of good road?
  ans:
  - yes, an easy distance.

- que:
  - shall we take this way together?
  ans:
  - with pleasure.

- que:
  - do you know mr bingley and his sisters?
  ans:
  - a little.

- que:
  - did mr darcy give his reasons for this interference?
  ans:
  - i understand there were some very strong objections to the lady.

- que:
  - you're disposed to think his interference officious?
  ans:
  - i don't see what right mr darcy had to determine and direct in what way his friend was to be happy.

- que:
  - miss bennet, are you unwell?
  ans:
  - a sudden headache.

- que:
  - you're sure?
  ans:
  - i cannot begin to count the occasions on which her ladyship has impressed upon me the importance of punctuality...

- que:
  - will you not sit down?
  ans:
  - in vain i have struggled.

- que:
  - and this is all the reply i am to expect?
  ans:
  - i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.

- que:
  - can you deny that you have done it?
  ans:
  - i have no wish to deny it.

- que:
  - and this is your opinion of me?
  ans:
  - my faults by this calculation are heavy indeed.

- que:
  - to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so below my own?
  ans:
  - you are mistaken, mr darcy.

- que:
  - what's so fucking funny?
  ans:
  - hey, keep laughing at me and i'll kill you.

- que:
  - you remember the old brick building on chester avenue?

  ans:
  - tell me that.

- que:
  - a deal?
  ans:
  - this isn't a used car we're talking about.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - so you think bree punched andrew in the face?
  ans:
  - i don't either, but on the other hand, she spanked my kids, she lied about her drinking and i once saw her bitch slap her mother in law.

- que:
  - how can you be so sure?
  ans:
  - we have andrew saying that it's systematic physical abuse.

- que:
  - how are we supposed to know the real truth?
  ans:
  - because i remember being 17.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.

  - what?
  ans:

  ans:
  - why'd you do that?

- que:
  - i guess i was just excited to get inside, i mean, that's why we came here isn't it?
  ans:
  - that's why we went all the way out to the black rock, and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch.

- que:
  - or, maybe it was just our destiny, right john?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - guys?
  ans:
  - ah, it's the hatch door, you'd better see this.

- que:
  - why do you wanna get down there so bad?
  ans:
  - ly.

- que:
  - why, because you wanna drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside, by a foot thick steel door that says quarantine?
  ans:
  - well look at the bright side, damage is done.

- que:
  - bright side?
  ans:
  - and if jack thinks i've lost it, i can't blame him really...

  ans:
  - so, what that's it, that's all?

- que:
  - you did something wrong?
  ans:

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - everywhere.

- que:
  - but, that doesn't matter now because that's not gonna work, there's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight.
  ans:
  - what, what whispers?

- que:
  - where's doctor artz?
  ans:

  ans:
  - it's for the hatch, i'm going in.

- que:
  - you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now john?
  ans:
  - i doubt it, in fact you're right, the safest thing is to stay here, wait for morning, wait for these others to see if they ever show up...

- que:
  - believe what?
  ans:
  - that everything's gonna be ok.

- que:
  - there's a glass?

  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - i was waiting for you.
  ans:

  - not too tight?
  ans:
  - i got it.

- que:
  - you're going back?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i changed my mind.

- que:

- que:
  - but what if you did?
  ans:
  - you don't know what you're talking about man.

  ans:
  - ah.

- que:
  - isn't it?
  ans:
  - it has to be.

- que:
  - as long as you're gonna kill me with flying ice, does it matter?
  ans:
  - excuse me, everyone.

- que:
  - mom?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - nice timing, huh?
  ans:
  - tell your mom you're getting married on the day she gets divorced.

- que:
  - why does love make people crazy?
  ans:
  - you didn't tell me you were doing it.

- que:
  - can you believe it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you're gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - your mom wants to get married?
  ans:
  - well, she wants to fall in love, halley.

- que:
  - where were you trying to get to in that canoe?
  ans:
  - no comment.

- que:
  - no comment?
  ans:
  - i don't speak to the press.

- que:
  - yeah, and anything i say can and will be used against me, right?
  ans:
  - i would never use anything against you.

- que:
  - it's you, right?
  ans:
  - wdyg's coolest dj.

- que:
  - that's hard to do without a mirror, isn't it?
  ans:
  - honey, you keep getting prettier every day.

- que:
  - i have no idea how you could say that, cause... you definitely don't see me every day, do you?
  ans:
  - and yesterday, my god, i was so ugly, and last wednesday... that sucked, too.

- que:
  - i'm kidding, okay?
  ans:
  - it's blank inside.

- que:
  - you know something?
  ans:
  - you're not too funny.

- que:
  - is that michael?
  ans:
  - for a redhead from...

- que:
  - sneaking up on me?
  ans:
  - hi, halley.

- que:
  - you remember my name?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - band?
  ans:
  - i would never sign up for band.

- que:
  - what's wrong with band?
  ans:
  - i don't play anything.

- que:
  - why don't you just give it a shot before you decide anything?
  ans:
  - daddy dog.

- que:
  - lorna, you up there?
  ans:
  - hi, len.

- que:
  - should we tell everyone our little secret?
  ans:
  - careful.

- que:
  - baby, you sure this is the time?
  ans:
  - i am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we're eloping.

- que:
  - that is your father's show, right?
  ans:
  - i just love it.

- que:
  - your father and your sister are getting married?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you didn't know about your dad getting married?
  ans:
  - yes, i did.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i've had to go to, like, five between my parents.

- que:
  - listen, m. t. wasn't giving you a hard time back there, was she?
  ans:
  - mrs. toussaint and i... we're on close terms.

- que:
  - you never saw star wars?
  ans:
  - no, i saw it.

- que:
  - well, that's your loss, isn't it?
  ans:
  - because the jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think, and they think it.

- que:
  - now what do you say?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - you didn't really start a fire, did you?
  ans:
  - i told you you'd ask me.

- que:
  - what kind of logic is that?
  ans:
  - it's logical logic.

- que:
  - haven't you noticed when the opposite sex gets together, eventually someone ends up getting hurt?
  ans:
  - i am, too... boycotting.

- que:
  - he didn't give any warning when you went dinner?
  ans:
  - none.

- que:
  - she was at that dinner?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - can't you picture walking down this aisle?
  ans:
  - in a coffin.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - well, i like it.

- que:
  - clean?
  ans:
  - it's not... it's not pretty, it's not intimate, it's not romantic.

- que:
  - you think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle?
  ans:
  - it hasn't even been that long.

- que:
  - wouldn't michael look cool in that?
  ans:
  - hey, i did a good job.

- que:
  - that's not the point, though, okay?
  ans:
  - enjoy him, and fool around with him.

- que:
  - maybe go by and look at it?
  ans:
  - or maybe...

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - they don't even like each other.

- que:
  - what are you looking for?
  ans:
  - these dishes, they're perfect.

- que:
  - isn't he adorable?
  ans:
  - he's cute.

- que:
  - you hear me?
  ans:
  - guys, back up.

- que:
  - give him some air, all right?
  ans:
  - call the doctor.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think it's 100 degrees out.

- que:
  - what am i supposed to do?
  ans:
  - the only black clothes i have are winter clothes.

- que:
  - does that sound crazy?
  ans:
  - this was a bad idea.

- que:
  - can you believe what she's wearing?
  ans:
  - that's, like, so disrespectful.

- que:
  - and do you, lorna p. queen, take this old guy len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - and who do you think you are?
  ans:
  - just because you've got great petals.

- que:
  - how was it?
  ans:
  - it was great... if you happen to be the devil and enjoy human pain.

- que:
  - was dad that much a loser when you guys got married?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - how can you promise you're gonna feel the same way forever?
  ans:
  - things do sometimes change, halley.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you'll be going to college soon.

- que:
  - here you go.
  ans:
  - where did you get that?

- que:
  - you're afraid to go out with me because you might like me?
  ans:
  - no, but that's a good theory, i guess, if you want to protect your fragile male ego.

- que:
  - you jedi mind tricked me.
  ans:
  - rejection?

- que:
  - halley, is that you out there?
  ans:
  - close your eyes.

- que:
  - who are you talking to?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i...

- que:
  - we're not gonna stay up very late, okay?
  ans:
  - at least do it inside.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - maybe it's a false reading.

- que:
  - what am i gonna do?
  ans:
  - so you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride.

- que:
  - shouldn't i be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry if you hate my taste and you think it's so awful you have to be in my wedding, but you are my sister.

- que:
  - okay, ashley, i'm sorry, all right?
  ans:
  - it's just...

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - i look awful.

- que:
  - ashley, would you drive halley home?
  ans:
  - it stole my money, so, just...

- que:
  - what's your pleasure?
  ans:
  - diet coke sounds good.

- que:
  - williams, again?
  ans:
  - nice to meet you.

- que:
  - aren't you gonna wear lipstick?
  ans:
  - you sound like mom.

- que:
  - you guys know you're wearing the same dress, right?
  ans:
  - unbelievable.

- que:
  - halley, could you please wear something a little more feminine?
  ans:
  - because the warshers are really traditional.

- que:
  - sweetheart, do you need the loo?
  ans:
  - grandma, no.

- que:
  - are you smoking the cannabis again?
  ans:
  - i had a little headache.

- que:
  - could you ring the bell?
  ans:
  - i do get headaches a lot.

- que:
  - does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me?
  ans:
  - this is a total disaster.

- que:
  - can i say i'm a vegetarian?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - tell me, how lost were you before you were found?
  ans:
  - because you look like a lady who doesn't get lost very often.

- que:
  - what was the name of that character?
  ans:
  - ashley.

- que:
  - well, you holler if you need any help at all, understand?
  ans:
  - i want this to be a memorable affair.

- que:
  - which way to the bathroom?
  ans:
  - down the hall and to your left.

- que:
  - isn't it a surprise... our children choosing to get married so young?
  ans:
  - i always thought lewis would take his time to find the right person.

- que:
  - young lady?
  ans:
  - open the door.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - lovely evening.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - your mom obviously doesn't want you to get married.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - you'll see when we get there.

- que:
  - you like it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - please?
  ans:
  - come on, macon.

- que:
  - but what is normal, anyway?
  ans:
  - growing up with my mom sure wasn't.

- que:
  - maybe being abnormal is what's normal... right?
  ans:
  - yeah, like you and macon.

- que:
  - didn't i explain?
  ans:
  - i'm a civil war reenactor... a little hobby.

- que:
  - would dinner tonight be too fast?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - friends?
  ans:
  - friends.

- que:
  - this is how you conduct yourself in your own home?
  ans:
  - you said it... my own home.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - maybe if you had a little bit more fun, you wouldn't be in the position you're in right now.

- que:
  - where is all this attitude coming from?
  ans:
  - this is not like you.

- que:
  - like me?
  ans:
  - you don't even know me.

- que:
  - mom, he's not strange, okay?
  ans:
  - his name is macon.

- que:
  - guess what?
  ans:
  - exclamation point.

- que:
  - why don't you try telling michael's parents what you really feel?
  ans:
  - macon land.

- que:
  - she doesn't know how to smile?
  ans:
  - maybe she doesn't want to.

- que:
  - here's to the new year, right?
  ans:
  - yeah, right.

- que:
  - what's up with you?
  ans:
  - i lost my damn earring.

  ans:
  - they went out all summer.

- que:
  - did they?
  ans:
  - yeah, and he was completely in love with her.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - halley, where are you going?
  ans:
  - ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

- que:
  - what was that all about?
  ans:
  - i thought you wanted us to be together.

- que:
  - any word from him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - disappearing?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - you really don't get it, do you?
  ans:
  - i'm really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up.

- que:
  - my... are you okay?
  ans:
  - hi, halley.

- que:
  - you think i'm doing those?
  ans:
  - i am not doing those.

- que:
  - and how would you know that?
  ans:
  - friday night she sneaks out to have sex with steve.

- que:
  - she told you that?
  ans:
  - she didn't want you to know.

- que:
  - top of the morning to you.
  ans:
  - god, why do people think that i can't handle the truth?

- que:
  - how is she?
  ans:
  - sweetie.

- que:
  - underwear?
  ans:
  - it was nothing.

- que:
  - don't promises we make to each other mean anything?
  ans:
  - of course they mean something, lewis.

- que:
  - you know what else?
  ans:
  - don't talk to me that way.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - i think they're breaking up.

  ans:
  - yes, i'm just smoking a little marijuana.

- que:
  - i do?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you remember when we went to see our comet together?
  ans:
  - halley was too young to remember that.

- que:
  - why does no one trust me to know what i know anymore?
  ans:
  - god.

- que:
  - who told you about that?
  ans:
  - he's not terrible looking.

- que:
  - life of my heart... once again... will you marry me?
  ans:
  - yes.

  - for?
  ans:

  ans:
  - and to my bride.

  - you taught it to me, remember?
  ans:
  - so, you know.

- que:
  - lorna, honey, any words of wisdom coming from you, my very own newlywed?
  ans:
  - waterproof mascara.

- que:
  - security?
  ans:
  - i don't know how to get you to listen, but maybe...

- que:
  - i'm not too old to wear pink?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - the rings?
  ans:
  - dear friends, let us ask god to bless these rings as a symbol of their love everlasting.

- que:
  - right now?

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - it doesn't get any better than this.

  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - miss smith?
  ans:
  - it's okay.

- que:
  - so, do you hate me?
  ans:
  - not you, per se.

- que:
  - you just hate the way i walk and talk and look?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - that jedi mind trick thing?
  ans:
  - i hate that.

- que:
  - isn't it?
  ans:
  - it has to be.

- que:
  - as long as you're gonna kill me with flying ice, does it matter?
  ans:
  - excuse me, everyone.

- que:
  - mom?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - nice timing, huh?
  ans:
  - tell your mom you're getting married on the day she gets divorced.

- que:
  - why does love make people crazy?
  ans:
  - you didn't tell me you were doing it.

- que:
  - can you believe it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you're gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - your mom wants to get married?
  ans:
  - well, she wants to fall in love, halley.

- que:
  - where were you trying to get to in that canoe?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i don't speak to the press.

- que:
  - yeah, and anything i say can and will be used against me, right?
  ans:
  - i would never use anything against you.

  ans:
  - it's blank inside.

- que:
  - you know something?
  ans:
  - you're not too funny.

- que:
  - sneaking up on me?
  ans:
  - hi, halley.

- que:
  - you remember my name?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - band?
  ans:
  - i would never sign up for band.

- que:
  - what's wrong with band?
  ans:
  - i don't play anything.

- que:
  - why don't you just give it a shot before you decide anything?
  ans:
  - 94 fm fill out this form.

- que:
  - lorna, you up there?
  ans:
  - hi, len.

- que:
  - should we tell everyone our little secret?
  ans:
  - careful.

- que:
  - baby, you sure this is the time?
  ans:
  - i am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we're eloping.

- que:
  - that is your father's show, right?
  ans:
  - i just love it.

- que:
  - your father and your sister are getting married?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you didn't know about your dad getting married?
  ans:
  - yes, i did.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i've had to go to, like, five between my parents.

- que:
  - listen, m. t. wasn't giving you a hard time back there, was she?
  ans:
  - mrs. toussaint and i... we're on close terms.

- que:
  - you never saw star wars?
  ans:
  - no, i saw it.

- que:
  - well, that's your loss, isn't it?
  ans:
  - because the jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think, and they think it.

- que:
  - is this any way to start the new year?
  ans:
  - pretend you're me.

- que:
  - now what do you say?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - you didn't really start a fire, did you?
  ans:
  - the point is that you put the words into somebody's mouth and they give them back like they've come up with the idea.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - i told you you'd ask me.

- que:
  - what kind of logic is that?
  ans:
  - it's logical logic.

- que:
  - haven't you noticed when the opposite sex gets together, eventually someone ends up getting hurt?
  ans:
  - i am, too... boycotting.

- que:
  - he didn't give any warning when you went dinner?
  ans:
  - none.

- que:
  - she was at that dinner?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - can't you picture walking down this aisle?
  ans:
  - in a coffin.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - well, i like it.

- que:
  - clean?
  ans:
  - it's not... it's not pretty, it's not intimate, it's not romantic.

- que:
  - you think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle?
  ans:
  - it hasn't even been that long.

- que:
  - wouldn't michael look cool in that?
  ans:
  - hey, i did a good job.

- que:
  - that's not the point, though, okay?
  ans:
  - enjoy him, and fool around with him.

- que:
  - maybe go by and look at it?
  ans:
  - or maybe...

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - they don't even like each other.

- que:
  - what are you looking for?
  ans:
  - these dishes, they're perfect.

- que:
  - isn't he adorable?
  ans:
  - he's cute.

- que:
  - you hear me?
  ans:
  - guys, back up.

- que:
  - give him some air, all right?
  ans:
  - call the doctor.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think it's 100 degrees out.

- que:
  - what am i supposed to do?
  ans:
  - the only black clothes i have are winter clothes.

- que:
  - does that sound crazy?
  ans:
  - this was a bad idea.

- que:
  - can you believe what she's wearing?
  ans:
  - that's, like, so disrespectful.

- que:
  - and do you, lorna p. queen, take this old guy len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - and who do you think you are?
  ans:
  - just because you've got great petals.

- que:
  - how was it?
  ans:
  - it was great... if you happen to be the devil and enjoy human pain.

- que:
  - was dad that much a loser when you guys got married?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - how can you promise you're gonna feel the same way forever?
  ans:
  - things do sometimes change, halley.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you'll be going to college soon.

- que:
  - here you go.
  ans:
  - where did you get that?

- que:
  - you're afraid to go out with me because you might like me?
  ans:
  - no, but that's a good theory, i guess, if you want to protect your fragile male ego.

- que:
  - you jedi mind tricked me.
  ans:
  - rejection?

- que:
  - halley, is that you out there?
  ans:
  - close your eyes.

- que:
  - who are you talking to?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i...

- que:
  - we're not gonna stay up very late, okay?
  ans:
  - at least do it inside.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - no offense, halley, but...... your perfume is making me sick.

- que:
  - okay, so do you prefer direct pee on a strip or dip in a cup?
  ans:
  - maybe it's a false reading.

- que:
  - what am i gonna do?
  ans:
  - so you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride.

- que:
  - shouldn't i be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry if you hate my taste and you think it's so awful you have to be in my wedding, but you are my sister.

- que:
  - okay, ashley, i'm sorry, all right?
  ans:
  - it's just...

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - i look awful.

- que:
  - ashley, would you drive halley home?
  ans:
  - it stole my money, so, just...

- que:
  - what's your pleasure?
  ans:
  - diet coke sounds good.

- que:
  - williams, again?
  ans:
  - nice to meet you.

- que:
  - aren't you gonna wear lipstick?
  ans:
  - you sound like mom.

- que:
  - you guys know you're wearing the same dress, right?
  ans:
  - unbelievable.

- que:
  - halley, could you please wear something a little more feminine?
  ans:
  - because the warshers are really traditional.

- que:
  - sweetheart, do you need the loo?
  ans:
  - grandma, no.

- que:
  - are you smoking the cannabis again?
  ans:
  - i had a little headache.

- que:
  - could you ring the bell?
  ans:
  - i do get headaches a lot.

- que:
  - does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me?
  ans:
  - this is a total disaster.

- que:
  - can i say i'm a vegetarian?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - tell me, how lost were you before you were found?
  ans:
  - because you look like a lady who doesn't get lost very often.

- que:
  - what was the name of that character?
  ans:
  - ashley.

- que:
  - well, you holler if you need any help at all, understand?
  ans:
  - i want this to be a memorable affair.

- que:
  - which way to the bathroom?
  ans:
  - down the hall and to your left.

- que:
  - isn't it a surprise... our children choosing to get married so young?
  ans:
  - i always thought lewis would take his time to find the right person.

- que:
  - young lady?
  ans:
  - open the door.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - lovely evening.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - your mom obviously doesn't want you to get married.

- que:
  - oh, you actually work for a living, you lower class, pathetic divorce?
  ans:
  - ashley, enough.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - you'll see when we get there.

- que:
  - you like it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - please?
  ans:
  - come on, macon.

- que:
  - but what is normal, anyway?
  ans:
  - growing up with my mom sure wasn't.

- que:
  - maybe being abnormal is what's normal... right?
  ans:
  - yeah, like you and macon.

- que:
  - didn't i explain?
  ans:
  - i'm a civil war reenactor... a little hobby.

- que:
  - would dinner tonight be too fast?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - friends?
  ans:
  - friends.

- que:
  - this is how you conduct yourself in your own home?
  ans:
  - you said it... my own home.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - maybe if you had a little bit more fun, you wouldn't be in the position you're in right now.

- que:
  - where is all this attitude coming from?
  ans:
  - this is not like you.

- que:
  - like me?
  ans:
  - you don't even know me.

- que:
  - mom, he's not strange, okay?
  ans:
  - his name is macon.

- que:
  - guess what?
  ans:
  - exclamation point.

- que:
  - why don't you try telling michael's parents what you really feel?
  ans:
  - macon land.

- que:
  - she doesn't know how to smile?
  ans:
  - maybe she doesn't want to.

- que:
  - here's to the new year, right?
  ans:
  - yeah, right.

- que:
  - what's up with you?
  ans:
  - i lost my damn earring.

  - did they?
  ans:
  - yeah, and he was completely in love with her.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - halley, where are you going?
  ans:
  - ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

- que:
  - what was that all about?
  ans:
  - i thought you wanted us to be together.

- que:
  - any word from him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - disappearing?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - you really don't get it, do you?
  ans:
  - i'm really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up.

- que:
  - oh, my... are you okay?
  ans:
  - hi, halley.

- que:
  - you think i'm doing those?
  ans:
  - i am not doing those.

- que:
  - and how would you know that?
  ans:
  - friday night she sneaks out to have sex with steve.

- que:
  - she told you that?
  ans:
  - she didn't want you to know.

- que:
  - top of the morning to you.
  ans:
  - god, why do people think that i can't handle the truth?

- que:
  - how is she?
  ans:
  - sweetie.

- que:
  - underwear?
  ans:
  - it was nothing.

- que:
  - don't promises we make to each other mean anything?
  ans:
  - of course they mean something, lewis.

- que:
  - you know what else?
  ans:
  - don't talk to me that way.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - i think they're breaking up.

  ans:
  - yes, i'm just smoking a little marijuana.

- que:
  - i do?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you remember when we went to see our comet together?
  ans:
  - halley was too young to remember that.

- que:
  - why does no one trust me to know what i know anymore?
  ans:
  - god.

- que:
  - who told you about that?
  ans:
  - he's not terrible looking.

- que:
  - life of my heart... once again... will you marry me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - friends?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - no, it's fine because we had our thing, and it was fun... until it wasn't anymore, right?
  ans:

  ans:
  - dear friends, let us ask god to bless these rings as a symbol of their love everlasting.

  - we ask her?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - just ask her?
  ans:
  - maybe it'll take a little begging, but nicely.

  - don't you think you'd be more comfortable with people who are more in your demographic?
  ans:
  - in sunny miami beach.

- que:
  - you threw her down the stairs?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - just, you know, snapping her neck or electrocuting her.

- que:
  - are you sure it was a rat, mrs. connelly?
  ans:
  - i saw its face.

- que:
  - you saw its face?
  ans:
  - all right, let's see if we can't find this big, bad rat.

- que:
  - you sure it might not have been a dust bunny?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:

  ans:
  - it's really stuffed up.

- que:

  - yeah.

- que:
  - how huge?
  ans:

  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - isn't it soothing?
  ans:
  - alex.

- que:
  - what has happened to your face?

- que:
  - too remote?
  ans:
  - oh, i understand.

- que:
  - feeling a little cramped?
  ans:
  - and it's all within your price range.

- que:
  - oh, you like books?
  ans:

- que:
  - this leads to where?
  ans:
  - i thought you realized.

- que:
  - as in two floors for the price of one?

  - i believe it's right there in the listing sheet.

- que:
  - were there, like, a slew of murders up there or something?
  ans:
  - no, there's just a sweet, little old lady that lives upstairs.

- que:
  - a tenant?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - she's gotta be close to 100 years old.
  ans:
  - so, rent control means we can't kick her out, right?

- que:
  - mrs. connelly?
  ans:
  - it may take her a while.

- que:
  - mrs. connelly?
  ans:
  - kenneth.

  - a bazillion?
  ans:
  - that's an incredible return.

- que:
  - come on, alex, what better way to finish your novel than in your own 19th century oak writer's nook?
  ans:
  - it would be nice not to write at starbucks with the other novelists.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm just taking a few little pictures for research.

- que:
  - who is it?
  ans:
  - hi, it's alex.

  ans:
  - i think she'd like that.

- que:
  - maxine?
  ans:
  - the thing is, there's been some tension between us at work business stuff and i would hate to expose you to that.

- que:
  - now, when you say that i can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
  ans:
  - well, we mean exactly that.

  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - do you mind?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you torturing me on purpose?
  ans:
  - i've fallen in love.

- que:
  - you're evil, maxine.
  ans:
  - you know why?

- que:
  - do you have any idea what it's like to have two people look at you... with total lust and devotion... through the same pair of eyes?
  ans:
  - just shut up.

- que:
  - what the hell, you know?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, sweetheart.

- que:
  - it's just a matter of practice before malkovich... is nothing more than another puppet hanging next to my work table.
  ans:
  - what the fuck is going on?

- que:
  - yeah, yada, yada, yada.
  ans:
  - i'll tell you about it when i get home, okay?

- que:
  - were you stoned?

  - huh?
  ans:
  - mr. malkovich, sir.

- que:
  - simulates?
  ans:
  - yeah, after a fashion.

- que:
  - what exactly does that mean?
  ans:

  ans:
  - we'll see.

- que:
  - malkovich, malkovich, malkovich?
  ans:
  - malkovich, malkovich.

  - do you understand?

- que:
  - god, lotte, what have i become?
  ans:
  - my wife in a cage with a monkey.

  ans:
  - i don't want to be a monster, lotte.

- que:
  - maxine?
  ans:
  - lotte.

- que:
  - okay, that was craig inside of malkovich?
  ans:
  - yes, it was him.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - so if craig can control malkovich...

- que:
  - it's confusing, you know?
  ans:
  - this is a very confusing situation.

- que:
  - listen, i should really get going, okay?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i can explain about the portal, darling.

- que:
  - how did you know it was me?
  ans:
  - lotte called me.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - well, i'm really sorry i did that, maxine... but i'm really in love with you, and i didn't know how else to be with you.

- que:
  - apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm getting better all the time.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - hi, dr. lester.

- que:
  - how's that?
  ans:
  - much better, thank you.

- que:
  - yes.
  ans:
  - so, my dear... what is it that brings you to my doorway on such an inhospitable evening?

- que:
  - and what prompted you to come to me with this issue?
  ans:
  - well, when i was here with my husband for dinner...

- que:
  - tell me... what is this strange power that malkovich exudes?
  ans:
  - you've gotta help me understand because all i think about is wanting to be him.

- que:
  - wanting to what?
  ans:
  - wanting to be him.

- que:
  - so dr. lester is such a vessel?
  ans:
  - yes, he is.

  ans:
  - we like you.

  ans:
  - yes, baby, but...

- que:
  - oh, you do, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - convincing a town to approve something that's already in their best interest?
  ans:
  - that's just delayed common sense.

- que:
  - just friends, right?
  ans:
  - yeah, friends.

- que:
  - and your father said you could do this for the show?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:

  - tough?
  ans:
  - ollie, you called a roomful of press a bunch of jerk offs, and trashed a client who's one of the biggest movie stars on the planet.

- que:
  - you wanna know how big?
  ans:
  - when i left mandellkirschner, there were some firms that wouldn't even look at my resume because i...

- que:

  - why do i have to sing your dad's part?
  ans:
  - i'm supposed to be the guy who gets clipped.

- que:
  - what the hell is that?
  ans:
  - it means if daddy breaks a leg, then you do his part for him.

- que:
  - yeah, what?
  ans:
  - i was just on the phone with an old friend that i worked with at mandellkirschner.

- que:
  - come on, when are you gonna learn?
  ans:

- que:
  - won't that be fun?
  ans:
  - but the subway's full of junkies and mole men.

- que:
  - i mean, look at him, he's a mad dog.
  ans:
  - what do i tell you?

- que:

  ans:
  - that's all horseshit.

- que:
  - except for the nights you're working, of course.
  ans:
  - baby, remember when i took you to see sweeney todd?

- que:
  - why don't you shut up for a second, ok?
  ans:
  - i'm trying to talk to my daughter.

- que:
  - yes, but daddy was just saying that to get them to say yes to a water main.
  ans:
  - why would you want some other job anyway, dad?

- que:
  - so you were just lying to everybody?
  ans:
  - look, ok, i'll tell you what.

- que:
  - i'll go to the meeting, all right?
  ans:
  - lf i don't like what the man says, then i won't take the job.

- que:
  - lsn't that important to you?
  ans:
  - sorry, i didn't mean that.

- que:
  - everybody?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - what, me?
  ans:
  - i mean, it's not like we've got some big romance going on or anything.

- que:
  - did you ever wonder if... maybe someday it might... be more than that?
  ans:
  - for about two seconds, before you had me hiding in the shower from your kid.

- que:
  - i mean, you think i'm gonna stick around here for much longer?
  ans:
  - maya...

  - why do i bother to strip her and put her clothes back on?
  ans:
  - there, i can help you out.

- que:
  - why haven't they come forward?
  ans:
  - maybe because whoever drove her home killed her.

- que:
  - sorry to bother you, but the phone problems?
  ans:
  - i took care of them.

- que:
  - guess what?
  ans:
  - no slug.

- que:
  - different from the one in her body?
  ans:
  - two different guns means two burglars.

- que:
  - they both went out the window?
  ans:
  - bullshit.

- que:
  - by the way...... why did he or they go out the window anyway...... when he or they got in by breaking a zillion dollar security system?

- que:
  - you guys do that?
  ans:

- que:
  - you're that bill burton?
  ans:
  - i was younger and dumber then.

- que:
  - who is he?
  ans:
  - it's luther whitney...... one of the great thieves of the world.

- que:
  - why haven't i ever heard of him?
  ans:
  - he hasn't been arrested in 30 years.

  ans:
  - that's history.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he hasn't killed anyone in 45 years.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - he's a veteran.

- que:
  - pardon me?
  ans:
  - it usually takes you guys a week to get to me.

- que:
  - would you like a signed confession now or do you want coffee first?
  ans:
  - before i send you away for life, i should probably check out your alibi.

- que:
  - you been following the case?
  ans:
  - yeah, i have.

- que:
  - this person, they go in the front door...... and out a window, down a rope in the middle of the night?

  - because?
  ans:
  - well, you need patience.

- que:
  - what kind of research?
  ans:
  - well, from what i saw on the tube, this is a rather large home.

- que:
  - why not just steal them?
  ans:
  - anyone can break into an office, but doing it...... without having people know you were there is the trick.

- que:
  - do you realize the skill of breaking the security of a security company?
  ans:
  - i don't know how those guys do it.

- que:
  - why go to all that trouble, luther?
  ans:
  - there's a vault in the house.

- que:
  - how do you mean?
  ans:
  - this guy obviously did the research you're talking about.

- que:
  - a clicker?
  ans:
  - well, a gizmo, like a vcr remote.

- que:
  - is that funny?
  ans:
  - i feel like you're trying to surprise me.

- que:
  - would the burglar use a disguise?
  ans:
  - yeah, he might.

- que:
  - weirdo?
  ans:
  - maybe like you.

- que:
  - could you turn that off?
  ans:
  - that is the sadness.

- que:
  - who can explain chance?
  ans:

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - i don't want money.

  ans:
  - gee, bill...... that could be construed as criticism.

- que:
  - have you had a lot of women, thomas?
  ans:
  - you start out by being promiscuous, and end up like your grandfather faithful to one woman.

- que:
  - these two?
  ans:
  - they'd fire a shot and run.

- que:
  - why should they die for us?
  ans:
  - or the french.

  ans:
  - i thought i saw something move.

  - what is it, anyway?
  ans:
  - my sister read the letter from your wife.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, phuong.
  ans:
  - how could you treat her like this?

- que:
  - so then why'd you lie to her?
  ans:
  - because i wanted to keep her.

- que:
  - have you ever stopped to think how lonely she'll be in england when you leave her?
  ans:
  - shut up, for christ's sake.

- que:
  - can we discuss this some other time?

  - bodyguard.

- que:
  - are you married yet?
  ans:
  - no, i figured i'd wait until we got home and do it properly.

- que:
  - you don't mind living here improperly?
  ans:
  - it's hard to talk if you're going to be so cynical.

- que:
  - so does this mean that we can still be friends?
  ans:
  - i don't see why not.

- que:
  - shouldn't i?
  ans:
  - well...

  ans:

- que:
  - have you not heard the stories?
  ans:
  - captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants sailed from the dreaded isla de muerta.

- que:
  - why ask me?
  ans:
  - because youre a pirate.

- que:
  - and you want to turn pirate yourself, is that it?

- que:
  - we open fire on our own ship, sir?

- que:
  - is that so?
  ans:
  - my father, will turner.

- que:
  - bootstrap?
  ans:
  - good man, good pirate.

- que:
  - and thats no incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
  ans:
  - now as long as youre just hanging there, pay attention.

- que:
  - but i cant bring this ship into tortuga all by me onesies, savvy?
  ans:
  - so...

- que:
  - tortuga?
  ans:
  - im going after the black pearl.

- que:
  - well, you know better than me the tales of the black pearl?
  ans:
  - thats why i know what barbossa is up to...... all i need is a crew.

- que:
  - the kid?
  ans:
  - that is the child of bootstrap bill turner.

- que:
  - is he now?
  ans:
  - one can only hope.

- que:
  - you don t know what this is, do you?
  ans:
  - it s a pirate medallion.

- que:
  - and the blood to be repaid?
  ans:
  - that s why there s no sense to be killing you...

- que:
  - o course it does.

  - so this is your able bodied crew?

- que:
  - satisfied?

- que:
  - with a compass that doesn't work?
  ans:
  - aye, the compass doesn't point north...... but we're not trying to find north, are we?.

- que:
  - what s in your head that s put you in such a fine mood, captain?
  ans:
  - we re catching up.

- que:
  - how is it that jack came by that compass?
  ans:
  - not a lot known about jack sparrow before he showed up in tortuga...... with a mind to go after the treasure of the isla de muerta.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he failed to mention that.

- que:
  - how did jack get off the island?
  ans:
  - aye, sea turtles.

- que:
  - what did he use for rope?
  ans:
  - keep to the code.

- que:
  - what code is gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?
  ans:
  - pirate s code.

- que:
  - have i ever given you reason not to trust me?
  ans:
  - do us a favor, i know it s difficult for you but please stay here.

- que:
  - sorry, jack, i m not going to be your leverage.
  ans:
  - and who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

- que:
  - that s it?
  ans:
  - waste not.

- que:
  - i don t feel no different?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who s to blame?
  ans:
  - every decision you ve made has led us from bad to worse.

- que:
  - damned to the depths whatever man had thought of parley?
  ans:
  - that would be the french.

- que:
  - jack sparrow?
  ans:
  - he fell behind.

- que:
  - how the blazes did you get off that island?
  ans:
  - when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing mate...

- que:
  - you know whose blood we need?
  ans:
  - i know whose blood ye need.

- que:
  - what sort of a man trades a man s life for a ship?
  ans:
  - pirate.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don t know.

- que:
  - why did you take it?
  ans:
  - because i was afraid that you were a pirate.

- que:
  - savvy?
  ans:
  - but that still leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with naught... but a name and your word it's the one i need.

- que:
  - funny old world, innit?
  ans:
  - captain, we re coming up on the interceptor.

- que:
  - what say you to that?
  ans:
  - the black pearl, she s gaining on us.

- que:
  - well, then can't we lose them amongst those shoals?
  ans:
  - anything.

- que:
  - ah, where s dear william?
  ans:
  - will.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - no one.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - and the crew, the crew are not to be harmed.

- que:
  - so i il be having that dress back before you go?
  ans:
  - i always liked you.

- que:
  - did ya not notice?
  ans:
  - that be the same little island that we made you governor.

- que:
  - were be jack s pistol?
  ans:
  - bring it forward.

- que:
  - to what point and purpose, young missy?
  ans:
  - the black pearl is gone.

- que:
  - last time... i was here a grand total of three days, alright?
  ans:
  - last time...... the rumrunners used this island as a cache.

- que:
  - wherever we want to go, we'll go.
  ans:
  - so that s it then?

- que:
  - that s what a ship is, you know?
  ans:
  - it s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that's what a ship needs...

- que:
  - why is the rum gone?
  ans:
  - one, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels.

- que:
  - but why is the rum gone?
  ans:
  - just wait, captain sparrow.

- que:
  - how can you pass that up?
  ans:
  - by remembering that i serve others, mr. sparrow, not only myself.

- que:
  - are you accepting the commodore s proposal?
  ans:
  - i am.

- que:
  - do i make myself clear?
  ans:
  - inescapably clear.

- que:
  - you knew william turner?
  ans:
  - old bootstrap bill... we knew him.

- que:
  - what do you have to lose?
  ans:
  - nothing i d lament being rid of.

- que:
  - where s elizabeth?
  ans:
  - she s safe, just like i promised.

- que:
  - why don t i want to be doing it?
  ans:
  - well, because...

- que:
  - what are we doing here?
  ans:
  - pirates come out... unprepared and unawares.

- que:
  - you think he wasn t telling the truth?
  ans:
  - just hear me out, mate.

- que:
  - but what of the pearl?
  ans:
  - name me captain.

- que:
  - savvy?
  ans:
  - i supose in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp.

- que:
  - it turns out that you re a hard man to predict.
  ans:
  - but you know, even a good decision if made for the wrong reasons...... can be a wrong decision?

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i think we should decide now.

- que:
  - couldn t resist, mate.
  ans:
  - what was that?

- que:
  - so what now, jack sparrow?
  ans:
  - will it be it two immortals locked in...

- que:
  - an epic battle until judgment day and trumpets sound?
  ans:
  - or you could surrender.

  - cotton s right, we ve got the pearl.
  ans:
  - ready?

- que:
  - what about jack, you re just going to leave him?

- que:
  - by throwing in your lot with him?
  ans:

- que:
  - and the apples?
  ans:

- que:
  - you don't know what this is, do ye?
  ans:
  - it's a pirate medallion.

- que:
  - and crazy to boot.
  ans:
  - and the blood to be repaid?

- que:
  - o'course it does.
  ans:
  - so this is your able bodied crew?

- que:
  - satisfied?
  ans:

- que:
  - and what's the benefit for us?
  ans:
  - anamaria.

- que:
  - i suppose you didn't deserve that one either?
  ans:
  - no, that one i deserved.

- que:
  - it'd be far worse not to, however.
  ans:
  - what say you?

- que:
  - aye, the compass doesn't point north...... but we're not trying to find north, are we?
  ans:
  - we should drop canvas, sir.

- que:
  - what's in your head that's put you in such a fine mood, captain?
  ans:
  - we're catching up.

- que:
  - how is it that jack came by that compass?
  ans:
  - not a lot known about jack sparrow before he showed up in tortuga...... with a mind to go after the treasure of the isla de muerta.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he failed to mention that.

- que:
  - how did jack get off the island?
  ans:
  - aye, sea turtles.

- que:
  - what did he use for rope?
  ans:
  - keep to the code.

- que:
  - what code is gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?
  ans:
  - pirate's code.

- que:
  - no heroes amongst thieves, eh?
  ans:
  - you know for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you're well on your way to becoming one.

- que:
  - have i ever given you reason not to trust me?
  ans:
  - do us a favor, i know it's difficult for you but please stay here... and try not to do anything stupid.

- que:
  - sorry, jack, i'm not going to be your leverage.
  ans:
  - and who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - waste not.

- que:
  - did it work?
  ans:
  - i don't feel no different.

- que:
  - how do we tell?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - you two.

- que:
  - who's to blame?
  ans:
  - that would be the french.

- que:
  - jack sparrow?
  ans:
  - he fell behind.

- que:
  - how the blazes did you get off that island?
  ans:
  - when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing mate...

- que:
  - you know whose blood we need?
  ans:
  - i know whose blood ye need.

- que:
  - what sort of a man trades a man's life for a ship?
  ans:
  - pirate.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why did you take it?
  ans:
  - because i was afraid that you were a pirate.

- que:
  - savvy?
  ans:
  - but that still leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with naught... but a name and your word it's the one i need.

- que:
  - what say you to that?
  ans:
  - now you see, jack, that's exactly the attitude that lost you the pearl.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - the black pearl, she's gaining on us.

- que:
  - we're shallow on the draft, right?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - well, then can't we lose them amongst those shoals?
  ans:
  - anything.

- que:
  - ah, where's dear william?
  ans:
  - will.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - no one.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - and the crew, the crew are not to be harmed.

- que:
  - though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don't it lads?
  ans:
  - that be the same little island that we made you governor of on our last little trip.

- que:
  - were be jack's pistol?
  ans:
  - bring it forward.

- que:
  - but you were marooned on this island before, weren't you?
  ans:
  - so we can escape in the same way you did then.

- que:
  - to what point and purpose, young missy?
  ans:
  - the black pearl is gone.

- que:
  - last time... i was here a grand total of three days, alright?
  ans:
  - last time...... the rumrunners used this island as a cache.

- que:
  - you spent three days lying on a beach, drinking rum?
  ans:
  - welcome to the caribbean, love.

- que:
  - why is the rum gone?
  ans:
  - one, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels.

- que:
  - but why is the rum gone?
  ans:
  - just wait, captain sparrow.

- que:
  - how can you pass that up?
  ans:
  - by remembering that i serve others, mr. sparrow, not only myself.

- que:
  - are you accepting the commodore's proposal?
  ans:
  - i am.

- que:
  - clap him in irons, right?
  ans:
  - mr. sparrow.

- que:
  - do i make myself clear?
  ans:
  - inescapably clear.

- que:
  - you knew william turner?
  ans:
  - never sat well with bootstrap what we did to jack sparrow.

- que:
  - what do you have to lose?
  ans:
  - nothing i'd lament being rid of.

- que:
  - where's elizabeth?
  ans:
  - she's safe, just like i promised.

- que:
  - why don't i want to be doing it?
  ans:
  - well, because...

- que:
  - what are we doing here?
  ans:
  - pirates come out... unprepared and unawares.

- que:
  - you think he wasn't telling the truth?
  ans:
  - just hear me out, mate.

- que:
  - but what of the pearl?
  ans:
  - name me captain.

- que:
  - savvy?
  ans:
  - i suppose in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp.

- que:
  - elizabeth?
  ans:
  - i just want you to know i... i believe you made a very good decision today.

- que:
  - you look nice, though.
  ans:
  - lieutenant?

- que:
  - i look nice?
  ans:
  - i must admit, jack, i thought i had ye figured.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i'm dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be...... dishonest.

- que:
  - what would you pick to eat first?
  ans:
  - i think we should decide now.

- que:
  - sorry.
  ans:
  - what was that?

- que:
  - will it be two immortals locked in... an epic battle until judgment day and trumpets sound?
  ans:
  - or you could surrender.

- que:
  - cotton's right, we've got the pearl.
  ans:
  - ready?

- que:
  - what about jack, you're just going to leave him?
  ans:
  - jack owes us a ship.

- que:
  - there's the code to consider the code?
  ans:
  - you're pirates, hang the code and hang the rules.

- que:
  - is it supposed to be doing that?
  ans:
  - they're stealing our ship.

- que:
  - you like pain?
  ans:
  - try wearing a corset.

- que:
  - at the moment?
  ans:
  - no fair.

- que:
  - parley?
  ans:
  - the ship is ours, gentlemen.

- que:
  - by throwing in your lot with him?
  ans:
  - it is.

- que:
  - i think we've all arrived at a very special place, eh?
  ans:
  - well, i think we can afford to give him one day's head start.

- que:
  - so, this is the path you've chosen, is it?
  ans:
  - it's okay.

- que:
  - what was in there?
  ans:
  - i have to figure things out.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - oh, christ, you haven't got some horrible six foot, tight t shirt wearing boyfriend?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - bernard?
  ans:
  - bernard.

- que:
  - i'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know?
  ans:
  - i mean, clearly it's about his mum but christ, he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all i know.

- que:
  - at the age of 1 1?
  ans:
  - well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.

- que:
  - you really want to know?
  ans:
  - i really want to know.

- que:
  - aren't you a bit young to be in love?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i... thought it'd be something worse.

- que:
  - worse than the total agony of being in love?
  ans:
  - er...

- que:
  - well, erm, where do you live, for instance?
  ans:
  - wandsworth.

- que:
  - so which exactly is the dodgy end?
  ans:

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?

  ans:
  - yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.

  ans:
  - i think you're not surprised.

- que:
  - and you stay here till christmas?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

  ans:
  - oh, absolutely, yes.

  - i've never found that.

- que:
  - how's your day so far?
  ans:
  - excellent.

- que:
  - did you see those pipes?
  ans:
  - yeah, she's terrific.

- que:
  - let's, erm... move on, shall we?
  ans:
  - well, now, that was an interesting day.

- que:
  - mr president, has it been a good visit?
  ans:
  - very satisfactory indeed.

- que:
  - covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - i fear that this has become a bad relationship.

- que:
  - have you gone completely insane?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yeah, sure, sure.

  ans:
  - before we run out of chances.

- que:
  - who, me?
  ans:
  - unless you just...

- que:
  - just, erm, would you excuse me for one second?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - when did you think of this?
  ans:
  - about three years ago.

- que:
  - didn't you say you learned how to live with it?
  ans:
  - i lied.

- que:
  - so now you just gotta prove it to yourself, right?
  ans:
  - just for myself.

- que:
  - how you gonna do that?
  ans:
  - you taught me everything you know.

- que:
  - you ready?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - wanna ring the bell?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - where'd you get that hat?
  ans:
  - a friend gave it to me.

- que:
  - who punched you in the eye?
  ans:
  - same friend.

- que:
  - i'm sorry i'm late.
  ans:

  ans:
  - let me set the mood.

- que:

- que:
  - has it been that rough?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - do you like it?
  ans:
  - it's beautiful.

- que:
  - you know what's amazing?
  ans:
  - that after all these years, everything still seems kinda new.

- que:
  - remember that?
  ans:
  - well, you're not.

- que:
  - how long are you here for?
  ans:
  - we talk later.

- que:
  - when are you gonna fight, drago?
  ans:
  - we talk later.

- que:
  - is it definite that the soviet union will enter professional boxing?
  ans:
  - no more talk now.

- que:
  - has he boxed against a professional?
  ans:
  - from having been trained in russia by great boxing coach manuel vega, and now by sergei rimsky, we hope he's qualified to do so.

- que:
  - hope?
  ans:
  - well, i know he is, but i don't want to sound too confident.

- que:
  - you think he can fight someone as seasoned as balboa?
  ans:
  - there is no one who can match his strength, endurance or aggressiveness.

- que:
  - can this mammoth russian, nicknamed the siberian express, wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks?
  ans:
  - whoever he fights first, it'll be one hot ticket.

- que:
  - dad, when can i learn to fight?
  ans:
  - i can't hear you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i wanna learn to fight.

- que:
  - could you turn your robot down?
  ans:
  - you see, i fight so you don't have to fight.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - that's nice.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - i'll be right there.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - yeah, apollo...

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - that's great.

- que:
  - coach rimsky, what does this do to enhance performance?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - has drago partaken in any experiments?
  ans:
  - no! lvan is naturally trained.

- que:
  - then how do you explain his... freakish strength?
  ans:
  - like your popeye, he ate his spinach every day.

- que:
  - shall we have a demonstration?
  ans:
  - please do.

- que:
  - and what results are those?
  ans:
  - whatever he hits, he destroys.

- que:
  - why do you wanna fight again?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what the hell is that?
  ans:
  - that's my girl.

- que:
  - paulie, who taught it to talk like that?
  ans:
  - she loves me.

- que:
  - either of you?
  ans:
  - i'll... get the coffee.

- que:
  - you ever try these comics?
  ans:
  - i should've slipped that one.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - maybe, but... really.

- que:
  - are you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - where do we go, stallion?
  ans:
  - cos we sure as hell can't be born again.

- que:
  - all right, but... when this is over...?
  ans:
  - you know me, stallion.

- que:
  - what made you decide to put on an exhibition fight with drago?
  ans:
  - let's call it a sense of responsibility.

- que:
  - no quick knockout predictions?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - rocky, how do you think apollo should fight drago?
  ans:
  - well, personally, i think the first thing you'd better get apollo is a ladder.

- que:
  - drago, how does it feel to spar with the great former champion?
  ans:
  - the man's tongue didn't come through customs.

- que:
  - how do you mean?
  ans:
  - in our country, apollo creed is well known and very respected.

- que:
  - now you don't really think you're gonna whip me, do ya?
  ans:
  - well, he didn't come here to lose.

- que:
  - how can you be so sure?
  ans:
  - i've been with the best.

- que:
  - you are not very realistic, are you, mr creed?
  ans:
  - you can box, yes, but you are far too old to think you can win over drago.

- que:
  - why do you insult us?
  ans:
  - a little loud for me.

- que:
  - but good?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - feels great.

- que:
  - try not to wear yourself out, ok?
  ans:
  - yeah, wear myself out.

- que:
  - postpone?
  ans:
  - come on, apollo.

- que:
  - then where does that leave me?
  ans:
  - this is just some kind of exhibition fight.

- que:
  - excuse me, would you?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - think you got enough names?
  ans:
  - be patient.

- que:
  - be back in a minute, all right?
  ans:
  - round one.

- que:
  - i defeat old man.
  ans:
  - is he ok?

- que:
  - will ya let him breathe?
  ans:
  - soon...

- que:
  - creed is in a very serious condition.
  ans:
  - where's the stretcher?

- que:
  - is the man alive?
  ans:
  - you can make it, apollo.

- que:
  - rocky, is the decision final?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is this the first time the champion has given up his crown?
  ans:
  - i don't know about that.

- que:
  - doesn't the title matter?
  ans:
  - not until this is over.

- que:
  - considering rocky's punching power, do you still expect an easy fight?
  ans:
  - yes, of course.

- que:
  - isn't it, gentlemen?
  ans:
  - drago is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

- que:
  - champ, how much are you making for this fight?
  ans:
  - no money.

- que:
  - has the fight date been set yet?
  ans:
  - december 25th.

- que:
  - why christmas?
  ans:
  - that's what i was told.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - it's in russia.

- que:
  - rocky, what's going on?
  ans:
  - we fight in soviet union, or we fight nowhere.

- que:
  - why don't you ask drago's wife why she is afraid?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why'd you do it?
  ans:
  - i just gotta do what i gotta do.

- que:
  - so where are you... going?
  ans:
  - they said they were gonna let me train in russia.

- que:
  - and for that you're willing to lose everything?
  ans:
  - adrian, this ain't everything.

- que:
  - even if you win, what have you won?
  ans:
  - apollo's still gone.

- que:
  - they belong to the boss.
  ans:
  - why can't you change your thinking?

- que:
  - paulie, did you pack your toothbrush?
  ans:
  - you know how tobacco stains your teeth.

- que:
  - when will you be back?
  ans:
  - oh, pretty soon.

- que:
  - are you scared?
  ans:
  - nah.

- que:
  - i'll be glad to get out of this.
  ans:
  - got any openings, man?

- que:

- que:
  - so how did you enjoy your file?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah, yeah.

- que:

  ans:
  - that's strange, because i was sure that you took it.

- que:
  - you know i stole it, all right?
  ans:
  - and stop being so goddamn happy about it, dr. sabian.

- que:
  - that's what it is, right?
  ans:
  - if you'd read further on, you would see that's not what i think.

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - i'm injured, all right?
  ans:
  - that's why i'm here.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - maybe you're right.

- que:
  - you want a medal?
  ans:
  - so now you're hiding behind that desk.

- que:
  - my own?
  ans:
  - yeah, your own.

- que:
  - did you feel that?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - who the fuck is smiley?
  ans:
  - should auld acquaintance be forgot

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - you heard me.

- que:

  ans:
  - that alarm hasn't worked in months.

- que:
  - frequencies are blocked.
  ans:
  - are you kidding me?

- que:
  - i don't think so, all right?
  ans:
  - see, this blackout, this is the kind of shit that deflates human smugness... about government's so called miraculous technologies.

  - doesn't it?
  ans:
  - this ain't no blackout, junkie.

- que:
  - yeah, we're perfectly safe now.

  ans:
  - i i need help real bad.

- que:
  - what are you doing this for, jake?
  ans:
  - nobody gives a shit anymore about anything.

- que:
  - i bet you it's causing you a lot of intestinal issues.
  ans:
  - fact or fiction?

- que:
  - why should i answer that question?
  ans:
  - because i'm thinking about sending you out to the wolves and saving my own ass if you don't.

- que:
  - how many cops are involved in this?
  ans:
  - i can't say exactly, but the blood money runs through your entire department.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - all of us.

- que:
  - you'd love to kill another cop today, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - they need to kill him before he fingers them in court.

- que:
  - iris, alex, you know how to use a firearm?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - but you know something, mike?
  ans:
  - i could live with that more than i could live with a cell mate.

  - how are you keeping it together?
  ans:
  - by the government sanctioned thugs abusing their authority again, man.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna do my best to protect you.

- que:
  - you really pull a man's spine out?
  ans:
  - it was an adam's apple.

- que:
  - dig it?
  ans:
  - and then you squeeze.

- que:
  - you think i'd let you survive until the morning?
  ans:
  - we don't have a lot of options here.

  ans:
  - i just transferred.

- que:
  - should i secure him here?

- que:
  - are you done yet?
  ans:
  - it's sealed shut.

- que:
  - jumpy?
  ans:
  - lie still.

- que:
  - now, how many fingers am i holding up?
  ans:
  - three.

- que:
  - what about this?
  ans:
  - your marriage is a fake.

- que:
  - and what is the hive?
  ans:
  - show them.

- que:
  - why can't i remember anything?
  ans:
  - the hive has its own defense mechanisms... all computer controlled.

- que:
  - for how long?
  ans:
  - subjective.

- que:
  - so you're saying this place was attacked?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid things are a little more complicated than that.

- que:
  - who's the red queen?
  ans:
  - state of the art artificial intelligence.

- que:
  - what happened here?
  ans:
  - five hours ago, red queen went homicidal.

  - why did she do it?
  ans:
  - that we don't know.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what's taking so long?
  ans:
  - red queen's defenses are in place.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - that's what will shut the queen down.

- que:
  - would you open that door now, please?
  ans:
  - i'm trying.

- que:
  - let's do it.
  ans:
  - what's that?

- que:
  - do what?
  ans:
  - we have to complete the mission.

- que:
  - dj vu, anyone?
  ans:
  - keep going.

- que:
  - please?
  ans:
  - she bit me, man.

- que:
  - how was she still standing?
  ans:
  - bitch isn't standing now.

- que:
  - what was all the shooting?
  ans:
  - we found a survivor.

- que:
  - and you shot him?
  ans:
  - she was crazed.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because blood doesn't do that till after you're dead.

- que:
  - can we go now?
  ans:
  - we're not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here.

- que:
  - what the fuck are you talking about?
  ans:
  - zero, four... zero, three, one... nine, six, five.

- que:
  - whatever they are, there's too many of them out there.
  ans:
  - got it?

- que:
  - whatever they are?
  ans:
  - it's pretty obvious what they are.

- que:
  - why didn't we see them on the way in?
  ans:
  - when you cut the power, you unlocked the doors.

- que:
  - lisa?
  ans:
  - i can help you get the virus.

- que:
  - but?
  ans:
  - but there's gonna be a price.

- que:
  - who was she?
  ans:
  - my sister.

- que:
  - what kind of research?
  ans:
  - the illegal kind.

- que:
  - so how was she going to make it out of here?
  ans:
  - she had a contact within the hive, someone i never met.

- que:
  - so why didn't she make it?
  ans:
  - maybe she trusted the wrong person.

- que:
  - what, worth all this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what about this door?
  ans:
  - they're waiting out there too.

- que:
  - and that way?
  ans:
  - it's a dead end.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - we don't have much time.

- que:
  - you know those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion?
  ans:
  - they seal shut in just under an hour.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - they can't just bury us alive down here.

- que:
  - and you're only telling us this now, when we're trapped... half a mile underground?
  ans:
  - we have to find a way out of this room.

- que:
  - where are you taking those?
  ans:
  - i'm turning her back on.

- que:
  - can you bypass it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - kaplan?
  ans:
  - the initial charge must have damaged her boards.

- que:
  - i did warn you, didn't i?
  ans:
  - tell us what's going on down here.

- que:
  - what about the t virus?
  ans:
  - the t virus was a major medical breakthrough... although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications.

- que:
  - how does it explain those things out there?
  ans:
  - even in death, the human body still remains active.

- que:
  - it brings the dead back to life?
  ans:
  - not fully.

- que:
  - which is?
  ans:
  - the need to feed.

- que:
  - how do you kill them?
  ans:
  - severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain... are the most effective methods.

- que:
  - why did you kill everybody down here?
  ans:
  - the t virus escaped into the air conditioning system... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.

- que:
  - may i ask why?
  ans:
  - insurance.

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - after you.

- que:
  - what the hell is this place?
  ans:
  - the utility tunnels.

- que:
  - rain?
  ans:

  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - there's a cure.

- que:
  - how do you know all this?
  ans:
  - because i was gonna steal it.

- que:
  - spence?
  ans:

  ans:
  - nothing... ever changes.

- que:
  - where is... the antivirus?
  ans:
  - it's on the train... where you found me.

- que:
  - in... or out?
  ans:
  - i don't know what we had... but it's over.

- que:
  - what the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - one of the hive's early experiments... produced by injecting the t virus directly into living tissue.

- que:
  - isn't that right?
  ans:
  - i didn't think any of you would make it this far.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?
  ans:
  - this long after infection... there's no guarantee it would work.

- que:
  - but there's a chance, right?
  ans:
  - i don't deal in chance.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - one of your group is infected.

- que:
  - what the fuck was that?
  ans:
  - it's a long story.

- que:

  ans:
  - line's dead.

- que:

- que:
  - jumpy?
  ans:
  - lie still.

- que:
  - now, how many fingers am i holding up?
  ans:
  - three.

- que:
  - what about this?
  ans:
  - your marriage is a fake.

- que:
  - and what is the hive?
  ans:
  - show them.

- que:
  - why can't i remember anything?
  ans:
  - the hive has its own defense mechanisms... all computer controlled.

- que:
  - for how long?
  ans:
  - subjective.

- que:
  - so you're saying this place was attacked?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid things are a little more complicated than that.

- que:
  - who's the red queen?
  ans:
  - state of the art artificial intelligence.

- que:
  - what happened here?
  ans:
  - five hours ago, red queen went homicidal.

  - why did she do it?
  ans:
  - that we don't know.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what's taking so long?
  ans:
  - red queen's defenses are in place.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - that's what will shut the queen down.

- que:
  - would you open that door now, please?
  ans:
  - i'm trying.

- que:
  - let's do it.
  ans:
  - what's that?

- que:

  - keep going.

- que:
  - please?
  ans:
  - she bit me, man.

- que:
  - how was she still standing?
  ans:
  - bitch isn't standing now.

- que:
  - what was all the shooting?
  ans:
  - we found a survivor.

- que:
  - and you shot him?
  ans:
  - she was crazed.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because blood doesn't do that till after you're dead.

- que:
  - can we go now?
  ans:
  - we're not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here.

- que:
  - what the fuck are you talking about?
  ans:
  - zero, four... zero, three, one... nine, six, five.

- que:
  - whatever they are, there's too many of them out there.
  ans:
  - got it?

- que:
  - whatever they are?
  ans:
  - it's pretty obvious what they are.

- que:
  - why didn't we see them on the way in?
  ans:
  - when you cut the power, you unlocked the doors.

- que:
  - lisa?
  ans:
  - i can help you get the virus.

- que:
  - but?
  ans:
  - but there's gonna be a price.

- que:

  ans:
  - my sister.

- que:
  - what kind of research?
  ans:
  - the illegal kind.

- que:
  - so how was she going to make it out of here?
  ans:
  - she had a contact within the hive, someone i never met.

- que:
  - so why didn't she make it?
  ans:
  - maybe she trusted the wrong person.

- que:
  - what, worth all this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what about this door?
  ans:
  - they're waiting out there too.

- que:
  - and that way?
  ans:
  - it's a dead end.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - we don't have much time.

- que:
  - you know those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion?
  ans:
  - they seal shut in just under an hour.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - they can't just bury us alive down here.

- que:
  - and you're only telling us this now, when we're trapped... half a mile underground?
  ans:
  - we have to find a way out of this room.

- que:

  ans:
  - the airport does not endorse solicitors.

- que:
  - have you received any packages from persons unknown to you?
  ans:
  - same as your birthday.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - september 25.

- que:
  - listen, ok?
  ans:
  - take some knowledge.

- que:
  - how did we lose him?
  ans:
  - go.

- que:
  - can you switch seats with christa?
  ans:
  - god, i would, but i got a bladder thing.

- que:
  - could you trade seats so blake and i could sit together?
  ans:
  - she asked tod, but he had some medical thing.

- que:
  - please?
  ans:
  - you're so sweet.

- que:
  - you really think we'd titty fuck them over greenland?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - ain't going that way.

- que:
  - may i have your attention?
  ans:
  - to properly fasten your seat belts... slide the flat portion into the buckle.

- que:
  - could you trade seats so blake and i could sit together?
  ans:
  - she asked tod, but he had some medical thing.

- que:
  - let go, jerk.
  ans:
  - please?

- que:
  - you got this?
  ans:
  - no one gets back on board.

- que:
  - been on a lot of planes that blew up?
  ans:
  - you fell asleep.

- que:
  - i didn't cause this.
  ans:
  - we get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in paris?

- que:
  - how should i know?
  ans:
  - you think i'm some...

- que:
  - are there any survivors?
  ans:
  - the cause for the explosion is still undetermined.

- que:
  - how did you know that?
  ans:
  - i got this feeling.

- que:
  - do you take any drugs?
  ans:
  - i saw it.

- que:
  - then why'd you say it?
  ans:
  - i didn't really think it was going to happen.

- que:
  - if that's the case, alex... why did you really get off the plane?
  ans:
  - my brother george... he told me to go keep an eye on alex.

- que:
  - you said you weren't friends with those that were... so, clear, why did you get off the plane?
  ans:
  - because i saw and i heard alex...

- que:
  - why don't you stay off the j. d., then?
  ans:
  - don't you ever fucking tell me what to do.

- que:
  - the thing is, when i was done with the test... you know the guy that drives with you during the test?
  ans:
  - anyways, he goes....

- que:
  - is that true?
  ans:
  - not now, not here, not ever, billy.

- que:
  - if i ask out cynthia paster, will she say no?
  ans:
  - fuck.

- que:
  - i miss you, you know?
  ans:
  - yeah, i miss you, too.

- que:
  - where's tod?
  ans:
  - get out of here.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - you caused tod so much guilt over george... he took his own life.

- que:
  - why would he make plans if he was going to kill himself?
  ans:
  - mr waggner.

- que:
  - why were you at tod's house last night?
  ans:
  - i've seen enough tv to know... the fbl doesn't investigate teen suicides.

- que:
  - you know what this is?
  ans:
  - this is a...

- que:
  - you can still feel it, can't you?
  ans:
  - something from that day is still with you.

- que:
  - what if tod was just the first?
  ans:
  - of us.

- que:
  - is that something that you're feeling?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - this place?
  ans:
  - doing something i'm not supposed to.

- que:
  - is that him?
  ans:
  - i think.

- que:
  - why did they make him up like michael jackson?
  ans:
  - that's him.

- que:
  - why'd his hand do that?
  ans:
  - chemicals.

- que:
  - what are all those tiny marks?
  ans:
  - cuticle lacerations from pulling at the wire.

- que:
  - pulling at the wire?
  ans:
  - if he was pulling at the wire, he didn't kill himself.

- que:
  - does that mean if... you figure out the design, you can cheat death?
  ans:
  - alex, you've already done that... by walking off the plane.

- que:
  - did it happen again, like on the plane?
  ans:
  - no, it didn't, but it might as well have.

- que:
  - we'll choke to death?
  ans:
  - i want to hear you... but we'll go nuts if you start with this shit.

- que:
  - the mortician said that death has a design, right?
  ans:
  - now, what if you, me, tod, carter...

- que:
  - terry, billy, mrs lewton messed up that design?
  ans:
  - for whatever reason, i saw death's plan... and we cheated it.

- que:
  - what if it still is our time?
  ans:
  - if it is, then it's not finished... and we will die.

- que:
  - when are you moving?
  ans:
  - hi, clear.

- que:
  - you want to talk to her?
  ans:
  - clear, he's in the shower.

- que:
  - can i get him to call you back?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - or to me?
  ans:
  - dad, you and mom have both been a big help... but there's something i need to understand... before i can talk.

- que:
  - i lived here my whole life, you know?
  ans:
  - and everywhere i looked were great memories.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i was just... checking the air in the tyre to make sure it's safe.

- que:
  - next?
  ans:
  - yeah, next, because... there's this pattern that's occurring.

- que:
  - you noticed that, too?
  ans:
  - mom's favourite.

- que:
  - did you catch it in some tv static?
  ans:
  - i never asked for what happened on the plane.

- que:
  - can you promise me no one else is going to die?
  ans:
  - no, i can't.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - we got nothing.

- que:
  - all right, just stay still, ok?
  ans:
  - oh, god, ms lewton.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - terry should be on this wall.

- que:
  - why'd you want us to meet you here?
  ans:
  - they're watching me to see if i go to alex.

- que:
  - why would i want to see him?
  ans:
  - because he knows which one of us is next.

- que:
  - drive the speed limit, ok?
  ans:
  - and don't pass on the right.

- que:
  - man, why'd you say that?
  ans:
  - because if you say another word, i'll fucking kill you.

- que:
  - somewhere... are they safe?
  ans:
  - when i was a kid, like six or seven...

- que:
  - why do you think i was hiding?
  ans:
  - billy told the fbl he saw you running from her house.

- que:
  - did you know she was going to be next before she was?
  ans:
  - yeah, i did.

- que:
  - all right, out of us... who's next to see it?
  ans:
  - please... tell me i'm going to see the jets win a super bowl.

- que:
  - it's me, right?
  ans:
  - that's why you're not saying.

- que:
  - you have a responsibility to tell me.
  ans:
  - what are you whining about?

- que:
  - think it's easier to know?
  ans:
  - it's not.

- que:
  - you get off having control over me?
  ans:
  - let me decide how to deal with it.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i can get nailed running this next red light.

- que:
  - move the car.
  ans:
  - what are you doing?

- que:
  - can't you open the door?
  ans:
  - open the fucking door.

- que:
  - are you god now?
  ans:
  - god's not afraid to die.

- que:
  - why don't you two get the fuck out of here?
  ans:
  - rusted.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i never moved.

- que:
  - it's weird being here, huh?
  ans:
  - we finally completed a puzzle.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - to terry.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - if you would've told me six months ago... the three of us would be sitting here having a drink...

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - the design.

- que:
  - hear me out, all right?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - but in my case, no one intervened, right?
  ans:
  - i was thrown from that power line... by the explosion, so...

- que:
  - that out of everyone on flight 180... you, me, and carter were meant to live?
  ans:
  - maybe that was the design all along.

- que:
  - can we just stop talking about this?
  ans:
  - let's figure out...

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - it's true.

- que:
  - clear, stay there, ok?
  ans:
  - stay away.

- que:
  - how's my suitcase working out for you?
  ans:
  - mom, you got to leave that on.

- que:
  - you said you weren't friends with those that were... so, clear, why did you get off the plane?
  ans:
  - because i saw and i heard alex...

- que:
  - why don't you stay off the j. d., then?
  ans:
  - don't you ever fucking tell me what to do.

- que:
  - the thing is, when i was done with the test... you know the guy that drives with you during the test?
  ans:
  - anyways, he goes....

- que:
  - ls that true?
  ans:
  - not now, not here, not ever, billy.

- que:
  - lf i ask out cynthia paster, will she say no?
  ans:
  - fuck.

- que:
  - i miss you, you know?
  ans:
  - yeah, i miss you, too.

- que:
  - where's tod?
  ans:
  - get out of here.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - you caused tod so much guilt over george... he took his own life.

- que:
  - why would he make plans if he was going to kill himself?
  ans:
  - mr waggner.

- que:
  - why were you at tod's house last night?
  ans:
  - i've seen enough tv to know... the fbl doesn't investigate teen suicides.

- que:
  - you know what this is?
  ans:
  - this is a...

- que:
  - you can still feel it, can't you?
  ans:
  - something from that day is still with you.

- que:
  - what if tod was just the first?
  ans:
  - of us.

- que:
  - ls that something that you're feeling?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - this place?
  ans:
  - doing something i'm not supposed to.

- que:
  - ls that him?
  ans:
  - i think.

- que:
  - why did they make him up like michael jackson?
  ans:
  - that's him.

- que:
  - why'd his hand do that?
  ans:
  - chemicals.

- que:
  - what are all those tiny marks?
  ans:
  - cuticle lacerations from pulling at the wire.

- que:
  - pulling at the wire?
  ans:
  - lf he was pulling at the wire, he didn't kill himself.

- que:
  - does that mean if... you figure out the design, you can cheat death?
  ans:
  - alex, you've already done that... by walking off the plane.

- que:
  - did it happen again, like on the plane?
  ans:
  - no, it didn't, but it might as well have.

- que:
  - we'll choke to death?
  ans:
  - i want to hear you... but we'll go nuts if you start with this shit.

- que:
  - the mortician said that death has a design, right?
  ans:
  - now, what if you, me, tod, carter...

- que:
  - terry, billy, mrs lewton messed up that design?
  ans:
  - for whatever reason, i saw death's plan... and we cheated it.

- que:
  - what if it still is our time?
  ans:
  - lf it is, then it's not finished... and we will die.

- que:
  - when are you moving?
  ans:
  - hi, clear.

- que:
  - you want to talk to her?
  ans:
  - clear, he's in the shower.

- que:
  - can i get him to call you back?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - or to me?
  ans:
  - dad, you and mom have both been a big help... but there's something i need to understand... before i can talk.

- que:
  - i lived here my whole life, you know?
  ans:
  - and everywhere i looked were great memories.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i was just... checking the air in the tyre to make sure it's safe.

- que:
  - next?
  ans:
  - yeah, next, because... there's this pattern that's occurring.

- que:
  - you noticed that, too?
  ans:
  - mom's favourite.

- que:
  - did you catch it in some tv static?
  ans:
  - i never asked for what happened on the plane.

- que:
  - can you promise me no one else is going to die?
  ans:
  - no, i can't.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - we got nothing.

- que:
  - all right, just stay still, ok?
  ans:
  - oh, god, ms lewton.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - terry should be on this wall.

- que:
  - why'd you want us to meet you here?
  ans:
  - they're watching me to see if i go to alex.

- que:
  - why would i want to see him?
  ans:
  - because he knows which one of us is next.

- que:
  - drive the speed limit, ok?
  ans:
  - and don't pass on the right.

- que:
  - man, why'd you say that?
  ans:
  - because if you say another word, i'll fucking kill you.

- que:
  - somewhere... are they safe?
  ans:
  - when i was a kid, like six or seven...

- que:
  - why do you think i was hiding?
  ans:
  - billy told the fbl he saw you running from her house.

- que:
  - did you know she was going to be next before she was?
  ans:
  - yeah, i did.

- que:
  - all right, out of us... who's next to see it?
  ans:
  - please... tell me i'm going to see the jets win a super bowl.

- que:
  - it's me, right?
  ans:
  - that's why you're not saying.

- que:
  - you have a responsibility to tell me.
  ans:
  - what are you whining about?

- que:
  - think it's easier to know?
  ans:
  - it's not.

- que:
  - you get off having control over me?
  ans:
  - let me decide how to deal with it.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i can get nailed running this next red light.

- que:
  - move the car.
  ans:
  - what are you doing?

- que:
  - can't you open the door?
  ans:
  - open the fucking door.

- que:
  - are you god now?
  ans:
  - god's not afraid to die.

- que:
  - why don't you two get the fuck out of here?
  ans:
  - rusted.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i never moved.

- que:
  - it's weird being here, huh?
  ans:
  - we finally completed a puzzle.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - to terry.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - lf you would've told me six months ago... the three of us would be sitting here having a drink...

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - the design.

- que:
  - hear me out, all right?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - but in my case, no one intervened, right?
  ans:
  - i was thrown from that power line... by the explosion, so...

- que:
  - that out of everyone on flight 180... you, me, and carter were meant to live?
  ans:
  - maybe that was the design all along.

- que:
  - can we just stop talking about this?
  ans:
  - let's figure out...

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - it's true.

- que:
  - clear, stay there, ok?
  ans:
  - stay away.

- que:
  - so who's next?
  ans:
  - awesome.

- que:
  - hey, does mom know you drive like that?
  ans:
  - whatever, ok.

- que:
  - can you get your stuff?
  ans:
  - i'm missing 90210.

  - only one thing for it, lad.
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - i feel smashing.

  ans:
  - hope you're keeping an eye on him.

  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - then why are you here?
  ans:
  - try to understand, when i look at sammy, i don't see some... vegetable.

- que:
  - what do you think that's like for me,..... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?
  ans:
  - that if i just could say the right thing,..... he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal.

- que:
  - what do you want from me?
  ans:
  - i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds..... and tell me if you really believe that sammy's faking his condition.

- que:
  - who the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - unfinished business.

- que:
  - whose house do you think you just walked out of?
  ans:
  - that's right, take a look at your pictures.

- que:
  - why's that?
  ans:
  - because by now she's taken a look at the suit and the car..... and she's figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.

- que:
  - see these?
  ans:
  - this is the bar where she works.

- que:
  - why should i care?
  ans:
  - because when she gets jammed up,..... she's gonna use you to protect herself.

- que:
  - from who?
  ans:
  - guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - well, maybe she'll make it you.

- que:
  - you worried that she's gonna use me against you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because she doesn't know who i am.

- que:
  - why are you following me?
  ans:
  - maybe i wanna help.

- que:
  - ok, einstein?
  ans:
  - so write this down.

- que:
  - you happy now?
  ans:
  - i won't be happy until you leave town.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - you ever wonder how long you can hang around here...

- que:
  - what sort of questions?
  ans:
  - the same questions you should be asking yourself.

- que:
  - like how did you get this suit, the car?
  ans:
  - i have money.

- que:
  - from what?
  ans:
  - you don't even know who you are.

  - what's wrong with this one?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - then why are you here?
  ans:
  - try to understand, when i look at sammy, i don't see some... vegetable.

- que:
  - what do you think that's like for me,..... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?
  ans:
  - that if i just could say the right thing,..... he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal.

- que:
  - what do you want from me?
  ans:
  - i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds..... and tell me if you really believe that sammy's faking his condition.

- que:
  - who the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - unfinished business.

- que:
  - whose house do you think you just walked out of?
  ans:
  - that's right, take a look at your pictures.

- que:
  - why's that?
  ans:
  - because by now she's taken a look at the suit and the car..... and she's figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.

- que:
  - see these?
  ans:
  - this is the bar where she works.

- que:
  - why should i care?

  - from who?
  ans:
  - guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.

- que:
  - you worried that she's gonna use me against you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?

  - like how did you get this suit, the car?
  ans:
  - i have money.

- que:
  - from what?
  ans:
  - you don't even know who you are.

  - you look all beat up.

- que:
  - i do?
  ans:
  - you're letting it get to you.

- que:
  - what's a rumor?
  ans:
  - i don't want to spread rumors.

- que:

  ans:
  - good to see you again.

- que:

- que:
  - but he took it well?
  ans:
  - overall, i'd say yes.

- que:
  - you got that?
  ans:
  - i have to say, going down to see him this morning was a masterstroke.

- que:
  - you think she'd say to see garvin?
  ans:
  - here's someone you should meet.

- que:
  - you're john conley?
  ans:
  - junior.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - that's a hello you'd give to a rash.

- que:
  - am i?
  ans:
  - the last few years i've been cleaning up the mess bob made of this company.

- que:
  - if it's such a mess, why am i so rich?
  ans:
  - yes, but you're a lot richer now.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - lit them up like a christmas tree.

- que:
  - goddamn garvin.
  ans:
  - so, what was it you wanted to see me about?

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i didn't get it.

- que:
  - he announced it?
  ans:
  - it was a secret.

- que:
  - will this affect the spin off?
  ans:
  - she doesn't know the difference between software and a sweater.

- que:
  - what aren't you telling us?
  ans:
  - i might be out of a job.

- que:
  - 271 00:15:34, 945 > 00:15:37, 664 this is the worst day of my life.
  ans:
  - you know what it's like out there?

- que:
  - nipples like pencil erasers?
  ans:
  - she's attractive.

- que:
  - sleeping with garvin?
  ans:
  - that's why he got a nordic track.

- que:
  - how do you think a clich? becomes a clich?
  ans:
  - i have a thing for you.

- que:
  - all right, please, can we get some work done?
  ans:
  - we got a small problem with arcamax.

- que:
  - how does a clich? become one?
  ans:
  - it is very weird.

- que:
  - he's not attractive?
  ans:
  - men and women are different.

- que:
  - are you saying i'm a virgin?
  ans:
  - meanwhile, you were asking me about the spin off.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - sorry you didn't get the promotion.

- que:
  - that long?
  ans:
  - but, bob....

- que:
  - can i have the lights?
  ans:
  - the advanced products group has been the heart of digicom for the last 10 years.

- que:
  - is meredith conservative?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - is there anything you don't know?
  ans:
  - freedom from the physical body.

- que:
  - does it mean something?
  ans:
  - only if she plans to make changes.

- que:
  - stephanie?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - what, all of a sudden there's stephanie lite?
  ans:
  - she was talking about her son at the university.

- que:
  - i'm jammed all day but why don't you come up at seven?
  ans:
  - we'll have a drink and catch up on business.

- que:
  - what's she want to see you at seven about?
  ans:
  - probably the arcamax problems.

- que:
  - she doesn't give you a boner?
  ans:
  - because, you know, i definitely have lift off.

- que:
  - you got a woody?
  ans:
  - she's very nice.

- que:
  - why would you want to?
  ans:
  - live a little.

- que:
  - where've you been all day?
  ans:

  - doesn't eliza look pretty?
  ans:
  - she looks like susan.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - domesticity.

- que:
  - remember that?
  ans:
  - it might be a chip.

- que:
  - is it all right if i leave for the day?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - meredith, come on.
  ans:
  - there, was that so bad?

- que:
  - remember all the things we did?
  ans:
  - i remember.

- que:
  - doesn't that make you feel good?
  ans:
  - don't stop me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - look, nobody has to know.

- que:
  - want to get fucked?
  ans:
  - do it.

- que:
  - is that what you want?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - is that what you want?
  ans:
  - this never happened.

- que:
  - i'm going to take a shower.
  ans:
  - you hear me?

  ans:
  - i thought so.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - meredith johnson.

- que:
  - she called?
  ans:
  - yeah, about ten minutes ago.

- que:
  - who is she?
  ans:
  - she's the one, the new vp.

- que:
  - she's the one?
  ans:
  - she came from the valley.

- que:
  - how old is she?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - had you ever heard of her?
  ans:
  - she's a face guy.

- que:
  - has she any technical background?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i deserve that, but ask yourself...... why does a man go with another girl?
  ans:
  - he's unhappy at home.

- que:
  - why are you wearing a t shirt?
  ans:
  - you never do.

- que:
  - what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - grin and bear it, like i usually do.

- que:
  - wool?
  ans:
  - with a little bit of viscose.

- que:
  - you work out?
  ans:
  - when i get a chance, bob.

- que:
  - where is everyone?
  ans:
  - they left 15 minutes ago.

- que:
  - nobody told you?
  ans:
  - hey, i know you.

- que:
  - what's the angel saying?
  ans:
  - that's between them.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - i believe it's your financial records.

- que:
  - did the ferry hit an iceberg?
  ans:
  - you were going to call me after meeting meredith.

- que:
  - hey, pal, i left a message on your machine, all right?
  ans:
  - check it out.

- que:
  - did you get my message?
  ans:
  - you told susan the meeting had been moved to 8:30.

- que:
  - how many of the drives meet specs?
  ans:
  - i don't have that information with me.

- que:
  - is that approximately right?
  ans:
  - the seek times are off specs.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - with the merger impending, shouldn't you have told someone?
  ans:
  - the merger isn't about a cd rom that might be obsolete in a year.

- que:
  - it'll be obsolete in a year?
  ans:
  - the promise of the arcamax...... was a central factor in this merger.

- que:
  - nine months?
  ans:
  - meredith said six weeks.

- que:
  - is there a problem?
  ans:
  - this isn't an inquisition.

- que:
  - sit down.
  ans:
  - and the bottom line is...... you don't know?

- que:
  - what'd i do?
  ans:
  - please, would you just sit.

- que:
  - what'd she say?
  ans:
  - she wants to handle the intervention internally, which is best.

- que:
  - what'd she say?
  ans:
  - not to put too fine a point on it, she said you sexually harassed her.

- que:
  - what would you call it?
  ans:
  - she jumped me.

- que:
  - she jumped you?
  ans:
  - looks like she defended herself.

- que:
  - i've never heard of a woman harassing a man.
  ans:
  - defended herself?

- que:
  - why're you here?
  ans:
  - i'm here as your friend.

- que:
  - want your wife to find out?
  ans:
  - 720 00:44:24, 745 > 00:44:26, 656 we'll have to tell her at some point.

- que:
  - austin?
  ans:
  - i told him what she said.

- que:
  - he denies it?
  ans:
  - you know, the man always denies it.

- que:
  - is he crazy?
  ans:
  - i offered him a move to austin.

- que:
  - you got that?
  ans:
  - i get the picture, bob.

- que:
  - there were no witnesses?
  ans:
  - her assistant left earlier in the night.

- que:
  - did you report that to anyone?
  ans:
  - in the morning, yeah.

- que:
  - what was the company's response?
  ans:
  - they believed her.

- que:
  - the point is, if i go to austin, i lose everything, all right?
  ans:
  - my stock options, everything that i worked for.

- que:
  - did you call anyone after the incident?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you tell your wife?
  ans:
  - oh, boy.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i didn't want to upset her.

- que:
  - how would you characterize miss johnson physically?
  ans:
  - she's very pretty.

- que:
  - rub you where?
  ans:
  - you know....

- que:
  - your penis?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - i'm uncomfortable talking about it.

- que:
  - because i'm a woman?
  ans:
  - you act like it's a game.

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - i want to know what my options are.

- que:
  - what your options are?
  ans:
  - i want to know whether i can sue her for sexual harassment.

- que:
  - do you not think it's a game, mr. sanders?
  ans:
  - it's a game to them.

- que:
  - how do you feel about losing?
  ans:
  - 793 00:49:56, 025 > 00:49:57, 617 that's what meredith wants.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - she's accused me.

- que:
  - why not press charges?
  ans:
  - meredith didn't press charges...... because she couldn't.

- que:
  - are you willing to play it?
  ans:
  - fuck them.

- que:
  - who the hell is he to sue me?
  ans:
  - sexual harassment, under title seven.

- que:
  - mediate?
  ans:
  - i want you to cut his balls off.

- que:
  - did he say mediate or split the difference?
  ans:
  - i'm just hoping he'll agree.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - he hasn't told his wife yet.

- que:
  - i know sanders, remember?
  ans:
  - he likes secrets.

- que:
  - where were you?
  ans:
  - they're pulling the drives apart.

- que:
  - john levin with sematach?
  ans:
  - he said it's important.

- que:
  - why didn't they come this morning?
  ans:
  - susan called about the benefit.

- que:
  - is everything okay?
  ans:
  - all he does anymore is give macadamia nuts to people.

- que:
  - what's slowing it down?
  ans:
  - over here.

- que:
  - is it a bug?
  ans:
  - don cherry debugged arcamax.

- que:
  - what're you doing?
  ans:
  - this is a sophisticated piece of electronics, not a pickup truck.

- que:
  - how bad is it?
  ans:
  - we have 4, 000 of these.

- que:
  - should i junk them all?
  ans:
  - i told arthur to send ten in heat sealed plastic bags.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - let's agree to mediate.

- que:
  - guess what?
  ans:
  - they locked me out of my computer and cleaned out my files.

- que:
  - i'm not interrupting?
  ans:
  - no, not at all.

- que:
  - going down?
  ans:
  - don't tell me you're scared of me.

- que:
  - which is more stigmatizing?
  ans:
  - yeah, barbie's stigmatized.

- que:
  - she was once a man?
  ans:
  - just tell her.

- que:
  - tell her what?
  ans:
  - tell her a lot of us have worked as hard as you...... and you're blowing this merger for all of us because you fucked up.

- que:
  - who got to you?
  ans:
  - it's not that simple.

- que:
  - who knows?
  ans:
  - an old girlfriend, a bottle of wine, a late meeting...

- que:
  - could you possibly be more lame?
  ans:
  - for your information, mark, tom told me everything.

- que:
  - did you have sex?
  ans:
  - and that was it.

- que:
  - her hand was in your pants?
  ans:
  - nothing happened.

- que:
  - you don't believe me?
  ans:
  - mark doesn't believe you.

- que:
  - how could you let this happen?
  ans:
  - nothing happened.

- que:
  - what does she look like?
  ans:
  - she's attractive.

- que:
  - what does the company say?
  ans:
  - they want me to transfer to austin, do some therapy.

- que:
  - austin?
  ans:
  - i'm not moving there.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - sexual harassment.

- que:
  - when were you going to tell me?
  ans:
  - that's brilliant.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - they'll destroy you.

- que:
  - do you have a lawyer?
  ans:
  - catherine alvarez.

- que:
  - you know how many times it's happened to me?
  ans:
  - you never said this ever happened you're so narcissistic.

- que:
  - why don't i just admit it?
  ans:
  - they call me a rapist and i apologize.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - good morning, i'm judge murphy.

- que:
  - any questions?
  ans:
  - let's get started.

- que:
  - then she approached you?
  ans:
  - correct.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - she kissed me in my ear...... on my neck...... on my mouth.

- que:
  - when you asked her to stop, did she?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - were you aroused?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did you climax?
  ans:
  - i grabbed her by the wrists.

- que:
  - then what did ms. johnson do?
  ans:
  - she threatened me.

- que:
  - mr. sanders, would you like a break?
  ans:
  - no, i'm fine.

- que:
  - you say the bottle of wine was ms. johnson's idea?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - but when you were living with ms. johnson...... didn't you discover wines together on trips to the napa valley?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - romantic trips?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did you have a conversation after lunch about how...... seeing meredith gave you a...... boner?
  ans:
  - someone else said that.

- que:
  - a boner?
  ans:
  - yes, but i didn't say it.

- que:
  - if it's harmless...... why are we here today?
  ans:
  - well, it was just...... what guys talk about.

- que:
  - about their boners?
  ans:
  - not generally, no.

- que:
  - yet you expect us to believe that after having a sexual conversation...... you weren't thinking of sex?
  ans:
  - that's correct.

- que:
  - highly sexual?
  ans:
  - i don't know how to rate it.

- que:
  - every day?
  ans:
  - sometimes twice a day.

- que:
  - she was just your boss now?
  ans:
  - that's correct.

- que:
  - and do you admit having an erection during your meeting?
  ans:
  - she had her top open.

- que:
  - do you think her gynecologist gets an erection when he examines her breast?
  ans:
  - that's completely different.

- que:
  - do you admit putting your penis in her mouth?
  ans:
  - she did.

- que:
  - did you tell your wife about your seven o'clock meeting with ms. johnson?
  ans:
  - i had a meeting and i'd be home late.

- que:
  - you expected to be late?
  ans:
  - no, but if i got home earlier my wife would be pleasantly surprised.

- que:
  - so you make it a rule to lie to your wife?
  ans:
  - i didn't lie.

- que:
  - when you got home, did you tell her what happened?
  ans:
  - no, i hoped it would go away.

- que:
  - you hoped you'd get away with it?
  ans:
  - do not debunk the illusion that this dispute might be settled amicably.

- que:
  - do you have those pictures now?
  ans:
  - i'd like copies for my file.

- que:
  - and where was mr. sanders at that point?
  ans:
  - he began to rub my shoulders.

- que:
  - and you let him?
  ans:
  - it was awkward...... but i thought we'd end the meeting and leave it at that.

- que:
  - then he tried to kiss you?
  ans:
  - no, mr. garvin called and then i came back to tom...... and said that was it, and then he began to kiss me.

- que:
  - did you try to stop him?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did he attack you physically?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - he put his...... penis in your mouth?
  ans:
  - this is making me uncomfortable.

- que:
  - want some water?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - were those his words?
  ans:
  - and then he reached down and tore off my panties.

- que:
  - what did you do then?
  ans:
  - he threw me down on the scaffold and i kneed him in the groin.

- que:
  - and that was the end of it?
  ans:
  - it's strange.

- que:
  - how did he react?
  ans:
  - he seemed to realize what he'd done.

- que:
  - did you call anyone afterwards?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you reported it the next day?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i talked to phil blackburn.

- que:
  - mr. sanders suggested the bottle of wine?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - did you tell her what kind?
  ans:
  - i said to get a nice chardonnay.

- que:

- que:
  - you, too?
  ans:
  - it's weird.

- que:
  - what do you think it is?
  ans:
  - i think it's the pinkos doing something with our radios.

- que:
  - what the heck's the matter with you, boy?
  ans:
  - could be a rock or some sort of fossil.

- que:
  - how deep in the ice is it?
  ans:
  - four, maybe five meters.

- que:
  - what do we do about it?
  ans:
  - i talked to the nasa research station at rundell peak.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - did he sound like there was a problem?
  ans:
  - come in.

- que:
  - john, about the student, right?
  ans:
  - i've been meaning to talk to you about her.

- que:
  - no, look, do you know who alexie gierach is?
  ans:
  - stanford genetics.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - well, station telemetry identified some sort of radio signal...

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - they burned a spectrogram of it on this cd.

- que:
  - plain or with cheese?
  ans:
  - i don't care.

- que:
  - what have you got?
  ans:
  - look at that.

- que:
  - nonrandom?
  ans:
  - definitely.

- que:
  - what about a meteorite?
  ans:
  - a meteorite as big as this would've left a mile wide crater in the ice shelf.

- que:
  - you said it was nonrandom?
  ans:
  - yes, with a fixed pulse device.

- que:
  - you mean some sort of new search signal?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - from a radio tech at the falklands.

- que:
  - where is it originating from?
  ans:
  - antarctic.

- que:
  - moved?
  ans:
  - that's what they said.

- que:
  - what can be boosting it?
  ans:
  - haven't a fucking clue.

- que:
  - they did?
  ans:
  - yes, indefinitely.

- que:
  - sure?
  ans:
  - hold on, let me take this.

- que:
  - what's your name again?
  ans:
  - nyla.

- que:
  - how far underground are we, nyla?
  ans:
  - about 20 meters.

- que:
  - what the hell is that?
  ans:
  - it's a glacier shift.

- que:
  - it's safe, right?
  ans:
  - yes, it's fine.

- que:
  - so, nyla, right?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - what do you do here?
  ans:
  - i came with michael...

- que:
  - what position is that?
  ans:
  - dr. brecher warned us about you.

- que:
  - you're not talking about kate brecher, are you?
  ans:
  - dr. brecher.

- que:
  - what do you think is inside it?
  ans:
  - my first guess would have been... a shale slag caught in a glacier.

- que:
  - could it be the work of setl?
  ans:
  - there is no more setl.

- que:
  - what did nasa say when you told them about this?
  ans:
  - i haven't.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - our work here is in a very sensitive stage... and we both know how paranoid nasa can get.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:

  - you're wearing bathing suits and growing corn.

- que:
  - everything's always a joke with you, isn't it?
  ans:
  - we've made a breakthrough in genetics that'll put us in the running for a nobel.

  ans:
  - it's like an interpreter.

- que:
  - interpreting what?
  ans:
  - messages from outer space, my dear.

- que:
  - just exactly how many signals have you interpreted?
  ans:
  - none, exactly.

- que:

  ans:
  - i can feel it in my joints.

- que:
  - was the signal harmonic when you first intercepted it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - two or more separate frequencies combined in one signal.

- que:
  - hard line here?
  ans:
  - if i can't communicate with the satellite, i'll have to intercept the signal here.

- que:
  - what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - try and find out what's buried in the harmonic.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - mathematics.

- que:
  - any luck?

  - you okay?
  ans:
  - it's got some sort of electrical charge to it.

- que:
  - what the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i'm talking about this.

- que:
  - that's a message?
  ans:
  - it's part of a message.

- que:
  - could there be more to the message that's not being deciphered?
  ans:
  - there could be several cryptographic keys.

- que:
  - alexie, what do you think?
  ans:
  - i agree with julian.

- que:
  - can we open it?
  ans:
  - if you can discharge it, i can pry it open.

- que:
  - you believe it's eti in origin, don't you?
  ans:
  - everything certainly points to it.

- que:
  - why do you hope i'm wrong?
  ans:
  - because if you're right, we could be neanderthals in comparison.

- que:
  - am i interrupting something?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what if we're already too late?
  ans:
  - we've considered that.

- que:
  - what do you think is inside it?
  ans:
  - nothing, i hope.

- que:
  - what if he's right?
  ans:
  - snap out of it, kate.

- que:
  - water exposure?
  ans:
  - it appears more like a molten degeneration... from exposure to extreme heat.

- que:
  - anything?
  ans:
  - no, it just keeps returning to that.

- que:
  - what exactly is it doing?
  ans:
  - trying to speak.

- que:
  - but with a different language?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - it's a computer game... where you have to figure out the math puzzles.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - maybe each piece of the message is its own key.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - mindmaze.

- que:
  - what do you think, abell?
  ans:
  - i think i'm getting there.

- que:
  - what could be in it?
  ans:
  - i've got the fire under control.

- que:
  - is anybody hurt?
  ans:
  - i'm okay.

- que:
  - how about yourself?
  ans:
  - i'm all right.

- que:
  - anybody down there?
  ans:
  - i'm okay.

- que:
  - what about jack?
  ans:

- que:
  - is anybody else hurt?
  ans:
  - i've got a few scratches.

- que:
  - where's the kid?
  ans:
  - last time i saw him, he was on the stairs.

- que:
  - pinter, you okay?
  ans:
  - let's get down there and see what happened.

- que:
  - is everybody accounted for?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah, i'm fine.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i've never seen technology like this.

- que:
  - what're you gonna do?
  ans:
  - i want to see what it is.

- que:
  - what's it doing?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on down here?
  ans:
  - we're going down in history.

- que:
  - you think it's dead?
  ans:
  - looks dead to me.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - must be airborne.

- que:
  - without prejudice?
  ans:
  - but we hold until we make contact.

- que:
  - viral?
  ans:
  - i think the infection is protozoan.

- que:
  - chances are we've all been infected, right?
  ans:
  - maybe not.

- que:
  - that's possible, isn't it?
  ans:
  - so is genetic flexibility.

- que:
  - what the hell's she talking about?
  ans:
  - sometimes a disease will slow down its infection rate... so it doesn't kill the thing it needs to live on.

- que:
  - you mean if we're all dead, it'll die, too?
  ans:
  - around 24 hours.

- que:
  - what area uses the most energy?
  ans:
  - the field labs.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the thing, it's gone.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - it must still be somewhere in the bay.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - we find it.

- que:
  - are there any firearms here?
  ans:
  - the pilots have two 9 millimeters in their gear.

- que:
  - why don't we split up?
  ans:
  - this is just great.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - jeez.

- que:
  - just don't sneak up on me like that, okay?
  ans:
  - let's go to the machine room and check the generators.

- que:
  - the question is... what will it do with us?
  ans:
  - i think it's these three.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - i'm not gonna hurt you.

- que:
  - rundeii peak, do you read?
  ans:
  - over.

- que:
  - this is about the alien, isn't it?
  ans:
  - my god, it's true.

- que:
  - how many fataiities?
  ans:
  - two by accident, four by infection.

- que:
  - has the environment outside the station been compromised?
  ans:
  - no one's been outside.

- que:
  - john, are you still there?
  ans:
  - what you found in the ice was an escape pod... simiiar to our own aircraft ejection system.

- que:
  - is it some form of telepathy?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is it stiii aiive?
  ans:
  - it's dead.

- que:
  - what do you mean, sterilization?
  ans:
  - it's been decided.

- que:
  - how the hell can they help us?
  ans:
  - they're not coming here to help us.

- que:
  - how iong do we have?
  ans:
  - lf we were, we would be dead.

- que:
  - what about running blood panels on us to verify it?
  ans:
  - protozoa is known to disguise itself in cellular protein.

- que:
  - could we be resistant?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - why don't you go help her get set up in the med lab?
  ans:
  - i don't fucking believe it.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - look for yourself.

- que:
  - what are the odds?
  ans:
  - 99. 999 to the infinite.

- que:
  - for christ's sake, what are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - i say we get out of here now.

- que:
  - what do you think, alexie?
  ans:
  - without absolute proof it would be incredibly irresponsible.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - lf there's no sign of it, i agree with you.

- que:
  - do you want to die for nothing?
  ans:
  - no, i don't.

- que:
  - are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - there's no sign of it in our blood.

- que:
  - what more fucking proof do you need?
  ans:
  - i'm not going anywhere with you.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because only you can fly the plane.

- que:
  - yeah, why?
  ans:
  - i think we should reprogram the codes in case someone decides to try and leave.

- que:
  - how long till we reach launch coordinates?
  ans:
  - eighteen minutes, captain.

- que:
  - are you okay, michael?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how long since we spoke to bachman?
  ans:
  - over an hour.

- que:
  - so now we wait?
  ans:
  - now we wait.

- que:
  - what's he talking about?
  ans:
  - the cornfields.

- que:
  - help me, julian.
  ans:
  - who's gonna fly the plane?

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - help me.

- que:
  - go where?
  ans:
  - we're out of time, we got to go.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - we'll use the maintenance bay door.

- que:
  - where's michael?
  ans:
  - he's dead.

- que:
  - what do we do now?
  ans:
  - they want us to go with them.

- que:
  - this cabinet minister... does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?
  ans:
  - apparently they strayed off course... and we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

- que:
  - what do you need us for?
  ans:
  - make it easy on yourself, dutch.

- que:
  - what's this fucking tie business?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - why'd you pass on libya?
  ans:
  - that wasn't my style.

- que:
  - why did you pass?
  ans:
  - we're a rescue team... not assassins.

- que:
  - now, what do we got to do?
  ans:
  - the cabinet minister's important to our scope of operations... in this part of the world.

- que:
  - who's our backup?
  ans:
  - this is a one way ticket.

- que:
  - this stuff will make you a damn sexual tyrannosaurus... just like me.
  ans:
  - get that stinking shit out of my face, will ya?

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - strap this on your sore ass, blain.

- que:
  - pick up the trail yet?
  ans:
  - billy's on it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - six men wearing us issued army boots.

- que:
  - mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - probably just another rebel patrol.

- que:
  - what's he got?
  ans:
  - same business.

- que:
  - do you remember afghanistan?
  ans:
  - trying to forget it.

- que:
  - what the hell were they doing here?
  ans:
  - i don't know, dutch.

- que:
  - why did they skin them?
  ans:
  - ain't no way for no soldier to die.

- que:
  - what happened here, billy?
  ans:
  - strange, major.

- que:

  ans:
  - this is goddamn beautiful.

- que:
  - why us?
  ans:
  - nobody else could've done it.

- que:
  - pissed about the cover story?
  ans:
  - i needed it to get you in here.

- que:
  - what story did you hand hopper?
  ans:
  - look, we've been looking for this place for months.

- que:
  - what happened to you, dillon?
  ans:
  - you used to be somebody i could trust.

- que:
  - why don't you?
  ans:
  - you're an asset... an expendable asset... and i used you to get the job done.

- que:
  - got it?
  ans:
  - my men are not expendable.

- que:
  - how much time?
  ans:
  - half hour, maybe less.

- que:
  - you wanna make that call or should l?
  ans:
  - she's your baggage.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - que pasa, amigo?
  ans:
  - a little taste off home.

- que:

  ans:
  - can't say, major.

  ans:
  - there's something in those trees.

- que:
  - do you see anything?
  ans:
  - up there ahead.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i guess it's nothing, major.

- que:
  - what the hell did you do to him?
  ans:
  - major, you better take a look at this.

- que:
  - did you find hawkins?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:

- que:
  - what makes you think he'll come through here?
  ans:
  - the trees have tripwires every 50 yards.

  ans:
  - you know what, ted?

- que:
  - i was on the new york to chicago flight, right?
  ans:
  - this guy gets on.

- que:
  - that's not what i would do.
  ans:
  - so i politely said to him,

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - well, you must, as a flight attendant, offer the option of buying another seat at half price for that oversized item.

- que:
  - say, christine, do you have any of those little wings?
  ans:
  - my nephew's been begging me for some.

- que:
  - we don't talk about it?
  ans:
  - i come home.

- que:
  - you're leaving?
  ans:
  - well, we've always said that cleveland is just a big waiting room.

- que:
  - i am?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i got fired.

- que:
  - you know, isn't it amazing how there was a ghost rider on my flight?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - how does someone go from royalty express to lnternational in such a short period of time?
  ans:
  - excuse me, christine.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - you just couldn't stand the fact that i was prettier than you.

- que:
  - do you suppose she could have killed him?
  ans:

  - it's o'shaughnessy.

- que:
  - tell me, mr. spade, am i to blame for last night?
  ans:
  - you warned us that thursby was dangerous.

- que:
  - was he married?
  ans:
  - yeah, with $10, 000 insurance, no children, and a wife that didn't like him.

- que:
  - mr. spade, do they know about me?
  ans:
  - not yet.

- que:
  - can't you shield me so i won't have to answer their questions?
  ans:
  - maybe, but i gotta know what it's all about.

- que:
  - why did you want him shadowed?
  ans:
  - to find out how far he'd gone, whom he'd met, things like that.

- que:
  - did he kill archer?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - did you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why all the guns?
  ans:
  - he lived by them.

- que:
  - how bad a spot are you actually in?
  ans:
  - bad as could be.

- que:
  - physical danger?
  ans:
  - i'm not heroic.

- que:
  - then, it's that?
  ans:
  - it's that, as surely as we're sitting here.

- que:
  - who killed thursby, your enemies or his?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - will you go to the police?
  ans:
  - i just got to stand still, and they'll be all over me.

- que:
  - how much money have you got?
  ans:
  - i've got about $500 left.

- que:
  - can't you get some more?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you got anything you can raise money on?
  ans:
  - i've got some furs and a little jewelry.

- que:
  - did you send the flowers?
  ans:
  - you're invaluable, darling.

- que:
  - hello, sid?
  ans:
  - i think i'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes, sid.

- que:
  - can i hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity...... secrets and whatnots all the same, priest or lawyer?
  ans:
  - but dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time.

- que:
  - what'll it cost to be on the safe side?
  ans:
  - thank you, sir.

- que:
  - may a stranger offer condolences for your partner's unfortunate death?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - yes, effie?
  ans:
  - no, that'll be all.

- que:
  - you have it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why should i sit here and let people come in and stick me up?
  ans:
  - certainly it is only natural that i try to save the owner...... such a considerable expense if possible.

- que:
  - who is he?
  ans:
  - mr. spade, you'll forgive my not answering that question.

- que:
  - would that do?
  ans:
  - it might.

- que:
  - you will take, say, $100?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what's your second guess?
  ans:
  - that you know where it is, or at least you know it is where you can get it.

- que:
  - you're not hiring me to do murders or burglaries...... but simply to get it back if possible, in an honest, lawful way?
  ans:
  - if possible.

- que:
  - may i please have my gun now?
  ans:
  - i don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.

- que:
  - you aren't exactly the sort of a person you pretend to be, are you?
  ans:
  - why, i'm not sure i know exactly what you mean.

- que:
  - do you know him?
  ans:
  - only slightly.

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - about me.

- que:
  - what did you talk about then?
  ans:
  - he offered me $5, 000 for the black bird.

- que:
  - you won't go around straightening things and poking the fire again, will you?
  ans:
  - no, i'm not.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - i said $5, 000 was a lot of money.

- que:
  - what else is there i can buy you with?
  ans:
  - i don't care what your secrets are.

- que:
  - what are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - i've got to talk to joel cairo.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - i want to leave a message for joel cairo.

- que:
  - that again?
  ans:
  - you know that's true, though.

- que:
  - you'll let me go about it with him...... in my own way?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - what boy?
  ans:
  - a kid.

- que:
  - did he follow you to my apartment?
  ans:
  - i shook him before that.

- que:
  - when will the money be ready?
  ans:
  - it is ready.

- que:
  - in cash?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you're ready to pay $5, 000 if we turn over the falcon to you?
  ans:
  - excuse me, please.

- que:
  - then, where is it?
  ans:
  - where floyd hid it.

- que:
  - then why do we have to wait a week?
  ans:
  - perhaps not a whole week.

- que:
  - and why, if i may ask another question, are you willing to sell it to me?
  ans:
  - because i'm afraid.

- que:
  - what exactly did happen to floyd?
  ans:
  - the fat man.

- que:
  - is he here?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what difference does it make?
  ans:
  - it might make a world of difference.

- que:
  - but, shall we add, more certainly...... the boy outside?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - when you're slapped you'll take it and like it.
  ans:
  - what was his name?

- que:
  - who's that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what now?
  ans:
  - we want to talk to you.

- que:
  - do we have to do it out in the hall?
  ans:
  - you can't come in.

- que:
  - why don't you be reasonable?
  ans:
  - it would pay you to play along with us.

- que:
  - is there anything to it?
  ans:
  - not a thing.

- que:
  - anything to that?
  ans:
  - talk is that's why he was put on the spot.

- que:
  - haven't you anything better to do than to pop in here...... early every morning asking fool questions?
  ans:
  - take it easy.

- que:
  - i guess you are.
  ans:
  - and the other?

- que:
  - did you do that?
  ans:
  - i had to.

- que:
  - you know how that is, lieutenant?
  ans:
  - but we didn't hurt him enough to make him cry for help.

- que:
  - what have you got to say to that?
  ans:
  - i don't know what to say.

- que:
  - facts?
  ans:
  - ask him.

- que:
  - the cut?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is that all you want, lieutenant?
  ans:
  - i think i'll be going now.

- que:
  - what's the hurry, cairo?
  ans:
  - there is no hurry.

- que:
  - do you always carry on so highhanded?
  ans:
  - well, you've had your talk with cairo.

- que:
  - am i a prisoner?
  ans:
  - maybe the boy outside hasn't gone home yet.

- que:
  - do you suppose he's still there?
  ans:
  - likely.

- que:
  - would you do something wild and unpredictable?
  ans:
  - i might.

- que:
  - what makes it so important?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - that was in istanbul?
  ans:
  - marmara.

- que:
  - what's the bird made of?
  ans:
  - porcelain or black stone.

- que:
  - was there any truth at all in that yarn?
  ans:
  - some.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - cairo.

- que:
  - new york, aren't you?
  ans:
  - shove off.

- que:
  - i won't forget you guys.
  ans:
  - why do you let these cheap gunmen hang around the lobby...... with their heaters bulging in their clothes?

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - say, what about miles?
  ans:
  - i'll see you, luke.

- que:
  - what could i do?
  ans:
  - i had to.

- que:
  - for how long?
  ans:
  - till a little while ago.

- que:
  - shake out?
  ans:
  - not one thing.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - the da's office called.

- que:
  - gutman, huh?
  ans:
  - thanks, darling.

- que:
  - did that boy follow you?
  ans:
  - no, angel.

- que:
  - you saw joel this morning?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because, true love, i need to keep in touch...... with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair if i'm ever to make heads or tails of it.

- que:
  - what's your woman's intuition say about her?
  ans:
  - she's all right.

- que:
  - you mean at home?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - is she in any danger, sam?
  ans:
  - i think she is.

- que:
  - what made you think of that?
  ans:
  - i was mad, sam.

- que:
  - by the way...... where were you the night miles was murdered?
  ans:
  - home.

- que:
  - well, now?
  ans:
  - you begin well, sir.

- que:
  - you're a close mouthed man?
  ans:
  - you're the man for me, sir.

- que:
  - are you here as miss o'shaughnessy's representative?
  ans:
  - there's nothing certain either way.

- que:
  - it depends on?
  ans:
  - maybe it depends on joel cairo.

- que:
  - the question is which do you represent?
  ans:
  - it'll be one or the other.

- que:
  - who else is it?
  ans:
  - there's me.

- que:
  - don't we all?
  ans:
  - i don't trust a man who says he's not.

- que:
  - mr. spade, have you any conception...... of how much money can be got for that black bird?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you mean, you don't know what that bird is?
  ans:
  - i know what it's supposed to look like...... and i know the value in human life you people put on it.

- que:
  - what is your impression?
  ans:
  - there's not much to go by.

- que:
  - well, sir, where is it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why not, if you've nothing to conceal?
  ans:
  - everybody has something to conceal.

- que:
  - the cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter, huh?
  ans:
  - well, let's go.

- que:
  - well, what's this?
  ans:
  - by gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing.

- que:
  - crusaders or something, weren't they?
  ans:
  - very good.

- que:
  - have you any conception of the extreme...... the immeasurable wealth of the order of that time?
  ans:
  - they were pretty well fixed.

- que:
  - ... what do you think of that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you begin to believe me a little?
  ans:
  - i haven't said i didn't.

- que:
  - then, the bird doesn't really belong to any of you, but to a general kemidov?
  ans:
  - well, sir, you might as well say it belonged to the king of spain.

- que:
  - and now, sir...... before we start to talk prices, how soon can you...... or how soon are you willing to produce the falcon?
  ans:
  - i will give you $25, 000 when you deliver the falcon to me...... and another $25, 000 later on.

- que:
  - in your own words, why not?
  ans:
  - that's a lot of dough.

- que:
  - what's the maximum?
  ans:
  - the maximum, i refuse to guess.

- que:
  - she didn't show up?
  ans:
  - you get back to the office and wait there till i come or you hear from me.

- que:
  - anybody burn?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - someone i know came what?
  ans:
  - someone i know came aboard this afternoon.

- que:
  - why couldn't he have stayed alive long enough to tell us something?
  ans:
  - here, here, here, none of that now.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - burlingame, 26 ancho.

- que:
  - may i borrow your pencil?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - say, frank?
  ans:
  - hello, mr. spade.

- que:
  - you got plenty of gas?
  ans:
  - sure thing.

- que:
  - do you know where ancho street is in burlingame?
  ans:
  - no, but we'll find her.

- que:
  - bum steer, mr. spade?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - is effie there?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - are you sure that was her voice?
  ans:
  - well, it was hooey.

- que:
  - nothing said about the bundle, huh?
  ans:
  - that's swell.

- que:
  - did they take you down to the hall?
  ans:
  - all right, precious.

- que:
  - can you make it or shall i carry you?
  ans:
  - i'll be all right as soon as i can get some place where i can lie down.

- que:
  - are you ready to make the first payment and take the falcon off my hands?
  ans:
  - well, sir, as to that....

- que:
  - $10, 000?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, we were.

- que:
  - three?
  ans:
  - there's only two, because thursby certainly killed your partner.

- que:
  - let's give them the gunsel.
  ans:
  - what's the difference?

- que:
  - he actually did shoot thursby and jacoby, didn't he?
  ans:
  - anyway, he's made to order for the part.

- que:
  - mighty funny, eh?
  ans:
  - mighty funny.

- que:
  - any better, precious?
  ans:
  - much better.

- que:
  - do you want a drink, angel?
  ans:
  - be careful, sam.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - if you're really serious, the least we can do in common politeness is to hear you out.

- que:
  - now, how would you be able to fix it so that wilmer couldn't do us any harm?
  ans:
  - get up on your feet.

- que:
  - want to hear it?
  ans:
  - you want the falcon.

- que:
  - if i know you can't afford to kill me, how'll you scare me into giving it to you?
  ans:
  - sir, there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill.

- que:
  - you see what i mean?
  ans:
  - if you start something, i'll make it a matter of your having to kill me or call it off.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - you can have him.

- que:
  - you have the envelope?
  ans:
  - miss o'shaughnessy has it.

- que:
  - why did he shoot thursby and why, where and how did he shoot captain jacoby?
  ans:
  - i've got to know all that happened so the parts that don't fit are covered up.

- que:
  - you didn't try to make a deal before giving him the works?
  ans:
  - we did.

- que:
  - you touched off the boat before you left?
  ans:
  - no, not intentionally.

- que:
  - and how about the shooting?
  ans:
  - we caught up with miss o'shaughnessy and jacoby at her apartment.

- que:
  - put the pot on, will you?
  ans:
  - i don't like to leave our guests.

- que:
  - hadn't you better leave the envelope in here?
  ans:
  - sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - i want to know about this.

- que:
  - i palmed it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you want to say so, or stand for a frisk?
  ans:
  - you'll admit it, or i'll search you.

- que:
  - later you'll give me millions, but...... how's about $15, 000 now?
  ans:
  - frankly and candidly, upon my word of honor as a gentleman...... $10, 000 is all the money i can raise.

- que:
  - dangerous?
  ans:
  - very.

- que:
  - how's the coffee coming, angel?
  ans:
  - in a few minutes.

- que:
  - can you start getting it now?
  ans:
  - i guess so.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you going?
  ans:
  - seventeen years i've wanted that item, and have been trying to get it.

- que:
  - you don't?
  ans:
  - frankly, sir, i'd like to have you along.

- que:
  - sergeant polhaus there?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - tom?
  ans:
  - i thought he betrayed me.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - i didn't mean to at first, really, i didn't.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - something like that.

- que:
  - you killed miles and you're going over for it.
  ans:
  - when thursby wouldn't tackle him...... you took his gun and did it yourself, right?

- que:
  - how can you do this to me, sam?
  ans:
  - surely, mr. archer wasn't as much to you as....

- que:
  - what have we got on the other side?
  ans:
  - all we've got is that maybe you love me and maybe i love you.

- que:
  - would you have done this if the falcon were real and you got your money?
  ans:
  - don't be too sure i'm as crooked as i'm supposed to be.

- que:
  - what's the matter with your playmate?
  ans:
  - he looks brokenhearted.

- que:
  - well, shall we be getting down to the hall?
  ans:
  - it's heavy.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - the stuff that dreams are made of.

- que:
  - how'd it go?
  ans:
  - lousy.

- que:
  - how was your day?
  ans:
  - it was great.
