  ans:
  - shelly wants me gone.

  ans:
  - yeah, i do.

- que:

  - why don't they release him to a halfway house...... or a center where he can get the care he needs?
  ans:

  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - you wanna see him killed in prison?

  ans:
  - if he thinks i think he's crazy, he's crazier than i think he is.

- que:
  - how could you bring him here?
  ans:
  - that mobster in my house, eating off of my dishes.

- que:
  - you have to bring home a gangster?
  ans:
  - he's in my custody.

- que:

  - yeah.

- que:
  - why would they do that?
  ans:

  - and why is that, vice?
  ans:
  - no judge would sign a warrant based on what you have.

  - but if we push too soon...

- que:
  - whose case is this?
  ans:

  ans:
  - a purchase order for the dna...

- que:
  - you need some time off?
  ans:
  - nope, i'm fine.

- que:
  - you want to see doc sluzer again?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you hear me?
  ans:
  - hi, it's cass.

- que:
  - so you'll run an analysis on that puke?
  ans:
  - i don't remember doing it.

- que:
  - with the dna, can they do that?
  ans:
  - i doubt it.

- que:
  - you doubt it?
  ans:
  - i doubt it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - california uses a gas chamber.

  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do they?
  ans:
  - they just don't know how to ask for it.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - richard, get out of the way.

- que:
  - you think i'm too young?
  ans:
  - there was a killer at your school.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - raymond feathers.

- que:
  - with that degenerate?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so you're friends with his old lady too?
  ans:
  - you're a tease.

- que:
  - i'm just a little messed up right now, but hear me out, as a friend.
  ans:
  - you can't handle it, so you're leaving?

- que:
  - just as a friend, okay?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - they barely have parents.

- que:
  - in the face?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - rod knows?
  ans:
  - he got a call from richard's father.

- que:
  - so nobody wants to work with me?
  ans:
  - that's okay.

- que:
  - who paid for this?
  ans:
  - cassie, out of her own pocket.

- que:
  - they'll talk without an attorney?
  ans:
  - they want to prove they're smarter than we are.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the hot one.

- que:
  - you get to work with her everyday?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so, what's up with ray?
  ans:
  - i hear he's like a serial killer or something.

- que:
  - can i lay it out for you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you believe it?
  ans:
  - it's a school paper.

- que:
  - was it random?
  ans:
  - i mean, that's the way i'd do it.

- que:
  - you understand what random means?
  ans:
  - don't get impatient.

- que:
  - how do you mean?
  ans:
  - if you kill somebody to prove you're free, and then throw up...

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - richard didn't feel guilty.

- que:
  - are we almost done?
  ans:
  - take a seat.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you went home, you said hello to your mother.

- que:
  - she never did, did she?
  ans:
  - i was with six friends all night.

- que:
  - the planting bed was dry, so where did they come from?
  ans:
  - it was you at the house.

- que:
  - how long did you wait for her to come home?
  ans:
  - i gotta say, that was a stroke of genius.

- que:
  - did you think it up, or was it justin?
  ans:
  - i don't know what you're saying.

- que:
  - what are you looking at?
  ans:
  - richard killed her.

- que:
  - didn't he, justin?
  ans:
  - i think it was justin.

- que:
  - she went out with richard?
  ans:
  - briefly.

- que:
  - justin's here?
  ans:
  - he told us about you.

- que:
  - which lisa?
  ans:
  - so you really need to tell me what happened.

- que:
  - is richard a pole vaulter?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - where did you get that?
  ans:
  - this is none of your god...

- que:
  - left for work?
  ans:
  - she couldn't, she had to go right then.

- que:
  - why then?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what are you gonna say?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - did you ever get help for any of this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so you want to talk to me about this covington woman?
  ans:
  - yes, i know all about it.

- que:
  - what can i do for you?
  ans:
  - i just thought you'd want to know what really happened.

- que:
  - how do you get away with it?
  ans:
  - we were bored.

- que:
  - did you make a deal with him?
  ans:
  - he says he wasn't there...

- que:
  - did you make a deal?
  ans:
  - i don't make deals over the phone, but if it checks out...... and we can get a conviction, i will.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - you're not supposed to leave without telling us.

- que:
  - will you be back for dinner?
  ans:
  - justin's not here.

- que:
  - what about goldilocks?
  ans:
  - get over there and see what she knows.

- que:
  - are you with her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - i left home.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - i'm gone.

- que:
  - do you remember what we talked about?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - to do what?
  ans:
  - i just have to.

- que:
  - should we say the words for the last time?
  ans:
  - one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - they're here at the old wintu lodge.

- que:
  - so since i have the bullets and the guts to use them...... i'll shoot you, and then i'll shoot myself, okay?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - or do you think you'll beat prison?
  ans:
  - shoot me in the head, in the heart.

- que:
  - you think you're so smart, huh?
  ans:
  - justin's smarter than you, remember that.

- que:
  - i'm okay, thank you.
  ans:
  - ... every night, the same fucking thing?

- que:
  - what's gonna happen to me?
  ans:
  - since you weren't the actual killer, and what you did down there for me....

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - whisper something into my ear.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - just anything.

- que:
  - where was it?
  ans:
  - i want to take that back.

- que:
  - did they find the videotape?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how's he doing?
  ans:
  - he looks okay.

- que:
  - why did you let richard videotape the killing?
  ans:
  - that was really stupid, like you guys wanted to get caught.

- que:
  - oh, you don't know?
  ans:
  - they found a hidden camera in richard's basement.

- que:
  - is there really a tape?
  ans:
  - maybe i should talk to a lawyer.

- que:
  - are you gonna do it or what?
  ans:
  - you don't do anything.

- que:
  - jessica marie hudson?
  ans:
  - jessica marie hudson.

- que:
  - jessica marie hudson?
  ans:
  - that's me.

- que:
  - you think you can go to school?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - have you seen my tie with the burgundy stripes?
  ans:
  - dry cleaner.

- que:

  ans:
  - oh, my...

- que:
  - we've got about 30 suspected cases in the l. a. region, with six deaths so far.
  ans:
  - josh?

- que:
  - what does it look like?
  ans:
  - it's not anthrax, it's not smallpox.

- que:
  - to track the links between victims?
  ans:
  - yes, and to predict the spread of the illness.

- que:
  - your guy's already got clearance?
  ans:
  - yes, at the highest level.

- que:
  - is there a problem?
  ans:
  - you just never told me.

- que:
  - are we putting out any kind of public health alert?
  ans:
  - an infectious pathogen is categorized as a weapon of mass destruction.

- que:
  - and if it keeps spreading?
  ans:
  - it is imperative that we avoid a public panic.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - where it started.

- que:
  - and what do you know so far?
  ans:
  - we have several hot spots associated with two or more victims.

- que:
  - in the days leading up, did josh go anywhere out of the ordinary?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - late... late from work?
  ans:
  - he's been in san diego the last few days.

- que:
  - did your wife go anywhere out of the ordinary over the last few days?
  ans:
  - it's been a normal week.

- que:
  - and you live in...?
  ans:
  - hancock park.

- que:
  - no classes today?
  ans:
  - nah.

- que:
  - are you working on something for don?
  ans:
  - it's a, um... it's a genetics project for a... for a friend in the bio department, actually.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - your friend.

- que:
  - does it matter?
  ans:
  - no, of course not.

- que:
  - uh, where you going right now?
  ans:
  - my book club.

- que:
  - mm hmm, and where's that?
  ans:
  - phil's house.

- que:
  - you keeping track of me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - actually, you know what?
  ans:
  - i've written it out.

- que:
  - is it a person or a place?
  ans:
  - what the cdc calls a patient zero.

- que:
  - where are the new patients we need to find?
  ans:
  - looks sort of like a plant.

- que:
  - how's it going?
  ans:
  - uh, good.

- que:
  - any more data on the victims?
  ans:
  - 11 more.

- que:
  - commander havercamp?
  ans:
  - this material just pushed us over the tipping point.

- que:
  - see it?
  ans:
  - the commonality of location.

- que:
  - it's like two trees growing from the same root, right?
  ans:
  - one to the north, and it's one south.

- que:
  - don?
  ans:
  - i'm not so sure about this finding.

- que:
  - a nd...?
  ans:
  - spanish flu.

- que:
  - how'd they stop it?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - in the united states?
  ans:
  - 600, 000.

- que:
  - in six months?
  ans:
  - i think we have to tell him, don.

- que:
  - well, so what?
  ans:
  - traffic downtown's always terrible.

- que:
  - and then downtown, isn't there's that, uh...?
  ans:
  - yeah, there's that protest march.

- que:
  - bowling?
  ans:
  - or golf.

- que:
  - but you don't want me to go downtown?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - okay, can we leave it at that?
  ans:
  - well, i'll take your concerns under consideration.

- que:
  - so, what, you're saying you resurrected the 1918 strain?
  ans:
  - viral pathogens can exist for decades hidden in nature, only to suddenly reenter the human population.

- que:
  - and what about personnel, have they gone on vacation, anybody called in sick, anything like that?
  ans:
  - uh... no, not recently.

- que:
  - why do you say that?
  ans:
  - because the spanish flu pathogen is handled only by experienced professionals.

- que:
  - you know all of them?
  ans:
  - many of them, yes, as a matter of fact.

- que:
  - you like her for this?
  ans:
  - like an arsonist who sets a fire so he can be the first person on a scene to report it.

- que:
  - forcing more federal funding?
  ans:
  - i'd like to run down that angle.

- que:
  - my reaction?
  ans:
  - my reaction is...

- que:
  - you sure it's the spanish flu?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - what kind of question is that?
  ans:
  - of course, you're sure.

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:
  - i know its gene fragments better than my own girlfriend.

- que:
  - are you looking for something in particular?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - which reunion?
  ans:
  - 15th.

- que:
  - what year'd you graduate?
  ans:
  - 1990.

- que:
  - do what?
  ans:
  - release the virus.

- que:
  - well, why else would you be here talking to me about the spanish flu?
  ans:
  - besides, the word is out in the bio community.

- que:
  - i know exactly how dangerous it is, okay?
  ans:
  - i am freaked.

- que:
  - but?
  ans:
  - well, if it's in the population, outside the lab taking lives, then the rush to develop a vaccine is very urgent.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, can you not do that?
  ans:
  - he's just doing his job.

- que:
  - you sure about that?
  ans:
  - i can't stress how serious a matter this is, sir.

- que:
  - what if we're wrong about union station in the first place?
  ans:
  - charlie, look, it is a classic dispersal site.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - every minute that goes by...

- que:
  - how do you forgive yourself if you're wrong?
  ans:
  - you don't.

- que:
  - larry... you have a minute?
  ans:
  - yes, because we all have exactly the same number of minutes, at all times.

- que:
  - do we not?
  ans:
  - oh, my.

- que:
  - and how can something be logical and mathematically suspect?
  ans:
  - i mean, as you are so fond of saying, math is logic.

- que:
  - when you met me just now, was i going out or coming into the library?
  ans:
  - i see your point.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - why isn't the virus spreading in all directions?
  ans:
  - because it wasn't released on a train... we would've found illnesses among passengers.

- que:
  - so how do we explain why the virus spreads north and south?
  ans:
  - well, i don't know, but union station is definitely a point of commonality for the victims.

- que:
  - i mean, it may not be the only one, right?
  ans:
  - i'll give you that.

- que:
  - so what does that mean?
  ans:
  - more sick people will be linked to the bus terminal than to the train station.

- que:
  - what am i reading this right, that people to the north are getting sicker than people to the south?
  ans:
  - 80  of the deaths link to the north pattern.

- que:
  - what if there's two different viruses?
  ans:
  - two strains of the same virus... traveling in two different directions.

- que:
  - what's the likelihood of two strains appearing naturally, in the same ace, at the same time?
  ans:
  - a statistical impossibility.

- que:
  - the less lethal one?
  ans:
  - well, now that we know about the buses, we can find victims we might have missed.

- que:
  - where've you been?
  ans:
  - uh, bowling.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - no, of course not.

- que:
  - look, if everybody can be down there, why can't i?
  ans:
  - i got this fuzzy feeling you and your brother have been going downtown, too.

- que:
  - huh, am i right?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - do you understand?
  ans:
  - look, charlie, your brother puts himself on the line every day on that job of his.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - but i know how vital that job is to him.

- que:
  - you know what i'm really proud of?
  ans:
  - i'm proud that i've raised two sons... well, we've raised two sons who have a great sense of public service.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - this is russell's strain, yeah?
  ans:
  - and this is gen o's.

- que:
  - i'm looking at you ; what do i see?
  ans:
  - everything... and nothing.

- que:
  - but are we talking about a charged black hole in anti de sitter space?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - you serve the warrant on grolsch?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you said he referred to a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - yeah, he did.

- que:
  - mr. grolsch, when we spoke before, you neglected to mention that you came to california from maryland.
  ans:
  - enough to push him over the edge?

- que:
  - after you grabbed me, did you put my groceries in the refrigerator?
  ans:
  - i had some frozen items in there.

- que:
  - where were you employed back east?
  ans:
  - russell labs you know that already or else i wouldn't be here.

- que:
  - you're linked to this outbreak in two ways, do you understand that?
  ans:
  - and as far as we could tell, you're the only person with access to both strains.

- que:
  - what were the two companies in competition for?
  ans:
  - i think maybe it's time that i had my lawyer present.

- que:
  - and what's the name of that company?
  ans:
  - craigmac pharmaceuticals.

- que:
  - so that's why you stole the virus, to help gen o and make yourself rich?
  ans:
  - it sure as hell wasn't to release it.

- que:
  - you think he was desperate enough to release both viruses just to prove gen o's was more deadly?
  ans:
  - maybe ; but like he said, there's also janice avery and dr. weaver.

- que:
  - as soon as that data comes in, you guys get it to me, understand?
  ans:
  - all right, see you in a little.

- que:
  - hey, don, did, um... did mom... did she suffer?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - the national security agency?
  ans:
  - yeah, a couple years ago, uh, bob tomkins called me.

- que:
  - assistant director robert tomkins?
  ans:
  - bob.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - they never told me that.

- que:
  - such as?
  ans:
  - russell labs might not have the best pathogen, but they've got a ceo who's got a good contact at the fda.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - dr. weaver.

- que:
  - how about we talk on the phone?
  ans:
  - um, i'm driving right now.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - i'd be happy to arrange a time to see you tomorrow.

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - approaching hancock park.

- que:
  - you wanted to prove your virus was more powerful, so you tested it on innocent people?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - save lives?
  ans:
  - 20 people are dead.

- que:
  - what do you got?
  ans:
  - candles.

- que:
  - did you think i was planning to release the virus again?
  ans:
  - let's go.

- que:
  - so, how are you two guys doing?
  ans:
  - well, you seem so much more relaxed than the last couple of days.

- que:
  - what are you two up to?
  ans:
  - bowling.

- que:
  - it was nothing like this, you know?
  ans:
  - i hope not, charlie.

- que:
  - we have troops stationed all over the globe, right?
  ans:
  - all right, stop.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't have it any other way.

- que:
  - wouldn't you like to know?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - what was it?
  ans:
  - i really can't tell you.

- que:
  - did you bring the pom poms?
  ans:
  - i brought something to help you sleep.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - nurse on the night shift said he came in about 4.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - i'm okay.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i figured you'd want an immediate report.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - we got everything.

- que:
  - the boots?
  ans:
  - that's an affirmative.

- que:
  - was it in a jar behind a stack of magazines...... or in the freezer under the turkey thigh?
  ans:
  - behind the vanilla fudge ice cream.

- que:
  - suicide?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - ever heard of a ritual mutilator, an impulsive serial type killer...... committing suicide?
  ans:
  - don't do that.

- que:
  - why did he run if he didn't do it?
  ans:
  - there's a reason.

- que:
  - rod?
  ans:
  - i don't care if i'm losing it.

- que:
  - how did you come by this?
  ans:
  - it was the weirdest thing.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - don't ask, don't tell.

- que:
  - when will we know?
  ans:
  - depends on the lab.

- que:
  - see you.
  ans:
  - want me to call him?

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - nope, i'm fine.

- que:
  - you want to see doc sluzer again?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you hear me?
  ans:
  - hi, it's cass.

- que:
  - so you'll run an analysis on that puke?
  ans:
  - i don't remember doing it.

- que:
  - with the dna, can they do that?
  ans:
  - i doubt it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - california uses a gas chamber.

- que:
  - don't worry, i'm not a backstabber like you, richard.
  ans:
  - you told her you tutor me too?

- que:
  - that's a good boy.
  ans:
  - how am i a back?

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - we can't be seen together.

- que:
  - do you think this is some kind of game?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do they?
  ans:
  - they just don't know how to ask for it.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - richard, get out of the way.

- que:
  - you think i'm too young?
  ans:
  - there was a killer at your school.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - raymond feathers.

- que:
  - with that degenerate?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so you're friends with his old lady too?
  ans:
  - you're a tease.

- que:
  - i'm just a little messed up right now, but hear me out, as a friend.
  ans:
  - you can't handle it, so you're leaving?

- que:
  - just as a friend, okay?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - they barely have parents.

- que:
  - in the face?
  ans:
  - he got a call from richard's father.

- que:
  - so nobody wants to work with me?
  ans:
  - that's okay.

- que:
  - who paid for this?
  ans:
  - cassie, out of her own pocket.

- que:
  - they'll talk without an attorney?
  ans:
  - they want to prove they're smarter than we are.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the hot one.

- que:
  - you get to work with her everyday?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so, what's up with ray?
  ans:
  - i hear he's like a serial killer or something.

- que:
  - can i lay it out for you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you believe it?
  ans:
  - it's a school paper.

- que:
  - was it random?
  ans:
  - i mean, that's the way i'd do it.

- que:
  - you understand what random means?
  ans:
  - don't get impatient.

- que:
  - i didn't.
  ans:
  - how do you mean?

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - richard didn't feel guilty.

- que:
  - are we almost done?
  ans:
  - take a seat.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you went home, you said hello to your mother.

- que:
  - she never did, did she?
  ans:
  - i was with six friends all night.

- que:
  - the planting bed was dry, so where did they come from?
  ans:
  - it was you at the house.

- que:
  - how long did you wait for her to come home?
  ans:
  - you didn't kill her there.

- que:
  - did you think it up, or was it justin?
  ans:
  - i don't know what you're saying.

- que:
  - what are you looking at?
  ans:
  - richard killed her.

- que:
  - didn't he, justin?
  ans:
  - i think it was justin.

- que:
  - she went out with richard?
  ans:
  - briefly.

- que:
  - justin's here?
  ans:
  - he told us about you.

  ans:
  - where did you get that?

- que:
  - why then?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what are you gonna say?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - did you ever get help for any of this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so you want to talk to me about this covington woman?
  ans:
  - yes, i know all about it.

- que:
  - what can i do for you?
  ans:
  - i just thought you'd want to know what really happened.

- que:
  - how do you get away with it?
  ans:
  - we were bored.

- que:
  - he says he wasn't there did you make a deal?
  ans:
  - i don't make deals over the phone, but if it checks out...

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - you're not supposed to leave without telling us.

- que:

  ans:
  - shoot me in the head, in the heart.

- que:
  - you think you're so smart, huh?

- que:
  - i'm okay, thank you.
  ans:
  - every night, the same fucking thing?

  - i'll see if she is available.

- que:
  - guess what?
  ans:

  - does the back of my neck look like this?
  ans:
  - it's now nine minutes.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - so, how's your day been so far?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - why don't we meet tonight at the bistro?
  ans:
  - okay, but the client's coming in.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i think she did that deliberately.

- que:
  - how'd you know?
  ans:
  - that's the mack move.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - she ain't no amateur.

- que:
  - was she talking a lot?
  ans:
  - if she was, she's covering.

- que:
  - she was talking, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - she seemed normal?
  ans:
  - yeah, she did.

- que:
  - have i steered you wrong?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - keith, calm down, bro.

- que:
  - test the waters?
  ans:
  - i don't want you to feel restricted.

- que:
  - restricted?
  ans:
  - and lately, i've been feeling a little trapped myself, so...... maybe it's the best thing.

- que:
  - is that cool with you?
  ans:
  - yeah, i was gonna suggest the same thing.

- que:
  - would you like me to take care of this?
  ans:
  - no, i'll pick this one up.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - i'm sure.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - she's good.

- que:
  - because she picked up a check?
  ans:
  - no, it's about a psychological advantage.

  - but what if this is that one other time?

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - you're running away?

- que:
  - what does all this mean, eggman?
  ans:
  - i don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.

- que:

  - what?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, was that uncomfortable, sarah?

  - he forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
  ans:
  - old man, where are you?

- que:
  - i think i can use that.
  ans:
  - he flew away?

- que:
  - but what if metal sonic and sonic aren't in the same place any more?
  ans:
  - don't worry.

- que:
  - how come?
  ans:
  - well, all of sonic's data was input into metal's memory.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i'm knuckles, sonic's best friend.

- que:
  - did you stop the generator?
  ans:
  - yes, it suits you very well, sarah.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - once metal has destroyed the land of the sky, it'll just be the two of us.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - then this will be the real fight.

- que:
  - this world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
  ans:
  - well, the feeling's mutual.

  - well...
  ans:
  - more importantly, what happened to sarah?

- que:
  - who is that?
  ans:

- que:
  - you really didn't send the guy?
  ans:
  - i didn't have you followed.

- que:
  - darryl?
  ans:
  - it could have been one of his guys.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - maybe you should ask him.

- que:
  - exactly what do you want this car for anyway?
  ans:
  - nostalgia.

- que:
  - you think it's still there?
  ans:
  - where i put it, it's not going anywhere.

  - what is it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i mean, i'm looking at your file here, and while your gpa is strong, your psat score wasn't so great.

- que:

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - people don't go this way.

- que:
  - and to go straight ahead is fatal?
  ans:
