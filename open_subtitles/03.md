  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - how long is that going to take?
  ans:
  - a day.

- que:
  - now, about your assistant?
  ans:
  - okay, pedro.

- que:
  - they killed the president of nova so that manuel pla could take over... and they framed agustin so pla could control intertel, right?
  ans:
  - you were a witness.

- que:
  - why didn't you expose them?
  ans:
  - i didn't know what i had.

- que:
  - whose tape is this?
  ans:
  - carlos aribau's.

- que:
  - have you no shame?
  ans:
  - the cops.

- que:
  - why didn't they catch this?
  ans:
  - because i gave them a dub.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i kept the original.

- que:
  - why did you do it?
  ans:
  - because...

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i just took it.

- que:
  - mr. mcgovern?
  ans:
  - i bet you think you're quite the hotshot.

- que:
  - is there a problem, sir?
  ans:
  - you, robinson, and your story.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - as a patsy, to cover up his crimes.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me sooner?
  ans:
  - i'm a reporter.

- que:
  - mr. robinson?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - the police report on agustin's death.

- que:
  - would you get me another drink, please?
  ans:
  - this is for vlps only.

- que:
  - how did you get in here?
  ans:
  - the security guard was female.

- que:
  - big fan, huh?
  ans:
  - he's going to foul.

- que:
  - if you were going to sit it out, why did you bait me?
  ans:
  - you were hungry, out to get a name.

- que:
  - so, i get my head blown off, and you sit behind your desk?
  ans:
  - hank, when you've seen what i've seen, and you've lived what i've lived... then you can judge me.

- que:
  - quite so, what's the joke?
  ans:
  - hank, good to see you.

- que:
  - what have i been up to?
  ans:
  - well, i was shot, chased, nearly killed.

- que:
  - hank, why don't i get you a drink?
  ans:
  - enjoy yourselves.

- que:
  - how did you know what was in agustin's police report before it was issued?
  ans:
  - i have an amazingly good contact in the barcelona police force.

- que:
  - you're lying.
  ans:
  - who?

- que:
  - am i?
  ans:
  - truth is in the eye of the beholder.

- que:
  - framing agustin?
  ans:
  - another obstacle removed.

- que:
  - why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - the internet is dangerous.

- que:
  - why don't we ask him?
  ans:
  - he's one of my guests.

- que:
  - he's right down there, see?
  ans:
  - i believe you've already made his acquaintance.

- que:
  - so, why don't we join the party?
  ans:
  - nobody will suspect me.

- que:
  - just give me a little time, all right?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - the plan?
  ans:
  - well, i thought i'd finish my puff piece on manuel pla... go down to the local watering hole, get shit faced, and try and get laid.

- que:
  - so you're going to do nothing?
  ans:
  - you're the one that wanted to leave it alone.

- que:
  - what, nothing to say?
  ans:
  - hank, look on the bright side.

- que:
  - baghdad, say, or kabul?
  ans:
  - i'm so sorry, archie.

- que:
  - any special plans tonight?
  ans:
  - those are top secret.

- que:
  - who's the lucky man?
  ans:
  - i'll never tell.

- que:
  - do i know him?
  ans:
  - you'll never get away with this, you know.

- que:
  - what are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - impress me.

- que:
  - listen, they killed her, okay?
  ans:
  - nicola.

- que:
  - meet me at 7tv, all right?
  ans:
  - don't ask.

- que:
  - listen, is the tape set?
  ans:
  - yes, we can broadcast...

- que:
  - hey, how are you doing?
  ans:
  - brechner.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid not, pal.

- que:
  - remember joaquim?
  ans:
  - a few drops of hydrochloric acid in a glass of beer... problem solved, if you know what i mean.

- que:
  - nicola?
  ans:
  - an injection.

- que:
  - looks just like a heart attack, don't you think?
  ans:
  - very clean.

- que:
  - the top?
  ans:
  - greed.

- que:
  - so ugly, isn't it, hank?
  ans:
  - i may have done the deed, but you sure made it easy.

- que:
  - why don't you go to hell?
  ans:
  - maybe i will.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - good thing your friend pedro called the police... when he saw your impromptu broadcast.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - aribau filmed the whole thing, right?
  ans:
  - nobody will suspect me.

- que:
  - what the hell do you think you've done?
  ans:
  - by ruining me, you've only achieved your own destruction, son.

- que:
  - what was it?
  ans:
  - believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see.

- que:
  - can i get my old job back?
  ans:
  - i'll think about it.

- que:
  - the rain's good for the farmers,
  ans:
  - huh?

- que:
  - mr. burmeister?
  ans:
  - yeah, burmeister.

- que:
  - right.
  ans:
  - but who's counting, right?

- que:
  - you wanna hear about my mom and my childhood, is that the kinda shit you're looking for?
  ans:
  - if that's why you're here.

- que:
  - okay.
  ans:
  - what do i look like?

- que:
  - it's not.
  ans:
  - so you're here because...?

- que:
  - got a minute?
  ans:
  - uh, in a second.

- que:
  - this won't keep till confession?
  ans:
  - i really need some help with this.

- que:
  - is it a woman?
  ans:
  - i'm so glad you could help me with this.

- que:
  - i've never done this before, y'know?
  ans:
  - well, that would be a good idea, except they're visiting grandma in ohio.

- que:
  - what about that thing called a job?
  ans:
  - that's a depressing thought.

- que:
  - carl, you need me to call you a cab?
  ans:
  - no, i'm not okay.

- que:
  - you want me to call the police?
  ans:
  - i i know you're just trying to help, but spending the rest of the night with a bunch of asshole cops isn't exactly what i need right now.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - no, sorry.

- que:
  - you're gonna be okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you got a stereo?
  ans:
  - well, i got a boom box.

- que:
  - hey.
  ans:
  - you wanna go listen to some music?

- que:
  - so, do you live in a house or an apartment?
  ans:
  - well, this is it.

- que:
  - you live here alone?
  ans:
  - it was my mother's before she died.

- que:
  - you own it?
  ans:
  - it's great.

- que:
  - water's fine.
  ans:
  - what is she, a real estate agent?

- que:
  - maybe some ice?
  ans:
  - water.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the water.

- que:
  - do you like water?
  ans:
  - i love it.

- que:
  - and what's your first favorite?
  ans:
  - fucking.

- que:
  - i guess you don't have to worry about that anymore, do you?
  ans:
  - i don't think of myself as the kind of person who's in this kind of office.

- que:
  - what about the woman you mentioned?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - let's just stay focused on the woman, okay?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - and you didn't try to help?
  ans:
  - oh, i would have.

- que:
  - but?
  ans:
  - i may have fallen asleep.

- que:
  - jewel?
  ans:
  - i know it was.

- que:
  - oh oh, that creep in the firebird?
  ans:
  - i know that guy.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we rob you.

- que:
  - i mean, do you believe that?
  ans:
  - i'm shocked.

- que:
  - i i take it this is something that you you've done before?
  ans:
  - just a couple of times.

- que:
  - how does he know where we are, anyway?
  ans:
  - i'm supposed to call him and tell him.

- que:
  - y'know, i generally think better with my shoes on, so...
  ans:
  - you you haven't done that yet, have you?

- que:
  - this guy utah, is he a mormon?
  ans:
  - uh, i wouldn't say that.

- que:
  - wh why didn't you call?
  ans:
  - i was just about to.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i got a car...

- que:
  - oh yeah?
  ans:
  - take it off.

- que:
  - oh, excuse me, okay.
  ans:
  - you want me to open it?

- que:
  - you're the big shot now, i'm nobody, right?
  ans:
  - okay, i'm over here now.

- que:
  - got any other features on this watch?
  ans:
  - it's got a stopwatch.

- que:
  - it's got a stopwatch?
  ans:
  - i never figured out how to use it.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - he was gonna kill you.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - because i've never actually slept with any of the other guys that i've done this with before, that's how.

- que:
  - is he dead?
  ans:
  - oh, jesus.

- que:
  - do you hate me now?
  ans:
  - it's just the sex and the violence all in one night, it's a little much.

- que:
  - that's a good idea.
  ans:
  - what are we gonna do now?

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah, really.

- que:
  - let's come up with another plan.
  ans:
  - we'll tell them the truth,

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - well, we could say that i shot him.

- que:
  - he did get shot, right?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - you mean there's another one out there like him?
  ans:
  - huh.

- que:
  - the mormon state?
  ans:
  - yeah, right.

- que:
  - he heard something?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - which was where?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - hidden next to the safe?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - about what time was this?
  ans:
  - his.

- que:
  - does she have anything to do with it?
  ans:
  - let her go.

- que:
  - sorry.
  ans:
  - so this girl, she's good in the sack, huh?

- que:
  - nice ass?
  ans:
  - i'm ironing.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - need your signature.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - 1 800 mattress.

- que:
  - any further down the line than killing utah together?
  ans:
  - you're right... you know what, it's me.

- que:
  - you what?
  ans:
  - i got canned.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - i guess.

- que:
  - she must have fucked you senseless when she found out you shot a guy?
  ans:
  - because i read that women cream for the violence.

- que:
  - a fountain?
  ans:
  - it's gonna be...

- que:
  - my mistake.
  ans:
  - better homes and fountains?

- que:
  - you know what, carl?
  ans:
  - you're not funny just rude.

- que:
  - why don't you let carl run you home?
  ans:
  - no, i'm afraid that's where your luck runs out.

- que:
  - would you buy a car?
  ans:
  - one of these days.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - so she said i could borrow it.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - then we're gonna have to buy one.

- que:
  - you're just afraid because now you don't have an excuse for not finding work, aren't you?
  ans:
  - stop right there, this has nothing to do with work.

- que:
  - god, you're full of shit.
  ans:
  - did you know it's safer to fly than it is to drive a car?

- que:
  - i'm full of shit?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - i come at a bad time?
  ans:
  - uh, no.

- que:
  - what'd he want?
  ans:
  - oh, you know, he's a cop.

- que:
  - did i... come at a bad time?
  ans:
  - there was something about him i just didn't like.

- que:
  - it was a busy ass night, awright?
  ans:
  - you should see what she does with my hose.

- que:
  - i say a lot of things.
  ans:
  - hmm?

  ans:
  - the woman?

- que:

  ans:
  - hot pants.

- que:
  - i got a guy with a hole in the back of his head where the exit wound was...
  ans:
  - it was a dress, like a, like a summer kind of farmer girl dress, you know?

- que:
  - um, would anybody care for another burger?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you're irresistible?
  ans:
  - women... women find me attractive.

- que:

  ans:
  - well, not exactly.

- que:
  - can we talk?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - but i am going to the moody blues with him.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm doing this for us as a couple, randy.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - you think i'm gonna have less anger and feel like more of a man if you start dating this guy?!

- que:
  - and he still owes you six hours overtime, right?
  ans:
  - i just don't think he knows what he had with you.

- que:
  - it was all right before?
  ans:

- que:
  - if i wasn't meant to be with her?
  ans:
  - sometimes some time apart is the best thing.

- que:
  - would i get to stay in the house?
  ans:
  - a temporary restraining order would keep him way for... 90 days.

  ans:
  - stopright there, this has nothing to do with work.

- que:
  - god, you're full of shit.
  ans:

  ans:

- que:
  - who shall i ask why you loved me then, and you don't love me now?
  ans:
  - i didn't.

- que:
  - some magical potion to give you strength, perhaps?
  ans:

- que:
  - can the man who survived my challenge not survive his own wedding night?
  ans:
  - brunhild, stop.

- que:
  - not as lucky as i am.
  ans:
  - wife, are you mad?

- que:
  - don't you think brunhild's beautiful?
  ans:
  - what a question for such a time and place.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - that coldness.

- que:
  - hear that?
  ans:
  - that's thor swinging his hammer.

- que:
  - giselher...... you don't really believe in all this pagan nonsense, do you?

  - of course.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - siegfried, she won't let me into her bed.

- que:
  - you'd refuse to help the man who gave you his own sister?
  ans:
  - your magic tarnhelm worked for us in iceland, blood brother.

- que:
  - you are a match for me, are you not?
  ans:
  - after all, you defeated me in iceland.

- que:
  - siegfried?
  ans:
  - now you can be my husband.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - to get rid of this pagan witchery.

- que:
  - where have you b ee n?
  ans:
  - kriemhild.

- que:
  - why aren't you in bed?

  - what's that in your hand?
  ans:
  - nothing important.

- que:
  - why try to hide it?
  ans:
  - it's not what you think.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - that i cannot tell you.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i promised not to.

- que:
  - and what kind of help leaves a woman's belt in your hand?
  ans:
  - if i told you, i would be breaking a vow of the utmost secrecy.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - we have orders from the qu ee n.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no one may enter the church until the qu ee n of the burgunds does so.

- que:
  - how dare you order the doors of this place closed to me?
  ans:
  - i am the king's own sister.

- que:
  - and how dare you refer to my husband as lesser than anyone?
  ans:
  - he even introduced himself in iceland as gunther's servant.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - you heard me.

- que:
  - who gave you that?
  ans:
  - my husband.

- que:
  - do you believe me now?
  ans:
  - he took it from you last night, in your own bedroom.

- que:
  - can't it be done any sooner?
  ans:
  - i wish...... but we cannot give your brother the impression...... that we leave bearing him ill will.

- que:
  - what justice can i administer to put this right?
  ans:
  - the simple justice laid down in our books of law may not be sufficient.

- que:
  - but what other use has he made of it?
  ans:
  - you've heard the people praise him more than you.

- que:
  - your downfall?
  ans:
  - you said the presence of that hoard...... in my chamber would bring me good.

- que:
  - but what about me?
  ans:
  - i was betrayed by the dragon slayer and by you.

- que:
  - what would you have me do?

  ans:
  - an e y e.

- que:
  - you love my movies?
  ans:
  - that changed my life.

- que:
  - i'll call you about it, okay?
  ans:
  - that's what i'm trying to say.

- que:
  - what do you mean she won't work with me?
  ans:
  - she's done nothing.

- que:
  - it was his last wish that you have this.
  ans:
  - hello?

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - no why... just here.

- que:
  - so, what did you guys think?
  ans:
  - so fake.

- que:
  - who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - a star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
  ans:
  - congratulations again.

- que:
  - and the rest of the film, what did you think?
  ans:
  - she's a miracle.

- que:
  - where did you find her?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - you really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
  ans:
  - only her brilliance.

- que:
  - i did?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - but who is simone?
  ans:
  - we know so little about her.

- que:
  - and why the secrecy?
  ans:
  - good to see you, too, elaine.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - she's not here.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because she would never come to something like this.

- que:
  - have you read the reviews?
  ans:
  - they're love letters.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - she is somewhat of a recluse.

- que:
  - is ms. simone coming in today?
  ans:
  - she's already here.

- que:
  - remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - what if it catches on fire?
  ans:
  - let it burn.

- que:
  - do you know what this means?
  ans:
  - we have stepped into a new dimension.

- que:
  - is this better, mr. taransky?
  ans:
  - much.

- que:
  - how do i look?
  ans:
  - give me audrey.

- que:
  - how do i look?
  ans:
  - perfect.

- que:
  - are you ever going to tell the truth about me, mr. taransky?
  ans:
  - i'm going tell the truth about you.

- que:
  - why wouldn't i?
  ans:
  - of course... with hank's tragic passing, his secret did die with him.

- que:
  - and what's real anymore?
  ans:
  - most actors these days have digital work done to them.

- que:
  - is this on?
  ans:
  - no questions regarding simone.

- que:
  - are they involved?
  ans:
  - they were at one time inseparable.

- que:
  - and now?
  ans:
  - now... sadly to say, only in spirit.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - they're cleaning the engine now.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yes, really.

- que:
  - maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
  ans:
  - i strongly sensed that she thought i would be perfect for clyde as well.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - strongly.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - simone, it's so great to hear from you.

- que:
  - how are you, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - you'll never guess who i'm with.

- que:
  - what's wrong now?
  ans:
  - i'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.

- que:
  - you want to go in another direction?
  ans:
  - well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.

- que:
  - what is this, some kind of jamming device?
  ans:
  - this is a bad place to talk.

- que:
  - why would they do that?
  ans:
  - well, whatever it is... it's dark.

- que:
  - dark?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you'll lose yourself in that thing.

- que:
  - how you gonna meet boys?
  ans:
  - dad, i know plenty of boys.

- que:
  - how do you know you're not talking to some middle aged freak?
  ans:
  - dad, i can spot a middle aged freak a mile away.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - you're trespassing.

- que:
  - what are you, holding her hostage?
  ans:
  - you're the hostage.

- que:
  - lainey, don't you ever wonder where i'm really hiding simone?
  ans:
  - just as long as i know where you are, dad.

- que:
  - hey, you want to come in?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - so she's really going to do all this nudity?
  ans:
  - it's on the page.

- que:
  - hair and make up?
  ans:
  - does her own.

- que:
  - you want her resume?
  ans:
  - i'll send it to you.

- que:
  - what about it?
  ans:
  - well, there isn't one.

- que:
  - h uh?
  ans:
  - experience, viktor.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how will you shoot our love scenes?
  ans:
  - body double.

- que:
  - for her?
  ans:
  - for you.

- que:
  - simone, are you there?
  ans:
  - i certainly am, mr. taransky.

- que:
  - why don't you leave me alone with my co stars, mr. taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - hi, who's there?
  ans:
  - don't be shy.

- que:
  - is that everyone?
  ans:
  - well, obviously, as you know, i'm simone.

- que:
  - who else?
  ans:
  - i just want to start by apologizing for my process.

- que:
  - but it's worth it, isn't it?
  ans:
  - we've done enough work today.

- que:
  - so how about... you and i going out on the town?
  ans:
  - it's simone.

- que:
  - for me?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
  ans:
  - it's incredible.

- que:
  - so much like... um, like her?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, of course.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - this is so exciting.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - i said do whatever you do to simone.

- que:
  - simone?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is that a problem?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - or something.
  ans:
  - is something wrong?

- que:
  - are you bus y tomorrow?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm fine, hal.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - somebody said she was here.

- que:
  - come on, where is she?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - not you two.
  ans:
  - is that her by the fountain?

- que:
  - is that what you're telling me?
  ans:
  - but this simone woman is good.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - well, we have some of taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.

- que:
  - you have one?
  ans:
  - i will when you're finished writing it.

- que:
  - what is this about?
  ans:
  - they're in the toilet.

- que:
  - just us.
  ans:
  - simone?

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - she's gone.

- que:
  - where are the sets?
  ans:
  - god, that is so like her.

- que:
  - what is all this?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - this is terrible.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - how is she going to plug the film?
  ans:
  - yes, indeed.

- que:
  - live?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - she didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
  ans:
  - actually, she did.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - viktor, i'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to simone?
  ans:
  - if i can find her.

- que:
  - why have you stay ed so completely out of the limelight?
  ans:
  - i guess i just think actors talk too much.

- que:
  - does the world really want to hear my life story just because i have a movie opening on friday?
  ans:
  - wow.

- que:
  - and you don't secretly want the attention?
  ans:
  - i'm not even sure i deserve it.

- que:
  - now, how is that healthy for a performer?
  ans:
  - because you have to understand, frank, none of this is real.

- que:
  - is there a mr. right in there somewhere?
  ans:
  - you know, frank, i'd rather not discuss my private life.

- que:
  - would you like a moment, simone?
  ans:
  - no, i'm okay.

- que:
  - how about the nudity?
  ans:
  - i know where that is.

- que:
  - what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
  ans:
  - i suppose what i like most about the movies i'm in is that they're not about special effects.

- que:
  - could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
  ans:
  - get in the car.

- que:
  - didn't we have this conversation before?
  ans:
  - yeah, web site interviews, no problem.

- que:
  - and for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
  ans:
  - now, i've obtained a copy of your bank account.

- que:
  - abduction?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what is it exactly that you want?
  ans:
  - i want to see her.

- que:
  - mr. taransky...?
  ans:
  - she's...

- que:
  - she's walking?
  ans:
  - you're in breach.

- que:
  - is this about the new pages?
  ans:
  - because i made the changes, all the changes you wanted.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - it's the biggest on earth.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - eh.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - it's just this.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - it's lower already.

- que:
  - do we have everything?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - the difference is you're not creative.

- que:
  - jack, are you there?
  ans:
  - she's good.

- que:
  - who needs a name?
  ans:
  - we'll cast an unknown.

- que:
  - i'm being difficult?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - i'm going to tell you why.
  ans:
  - elaine, do you know what these are?

- que:
  - so, what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - elaine, she doesn't have children.

- que:
  - don't you see?
  ans:
  - they're mocking us.

- que:
  - i mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
  ans:
  - we were the ones who would tell them what to do.

- que:
  - remember?
  ans:
  - here we go.

- que:
  - what were we doing?
  ans:
  - we were trying to make something important.

- que:
  - who do you think pays for all of this?
  ans:
  - this is about investment and return.

- que:
  - hey, dad.
  ans:
  - you're not renewing my contract?

- que:
  - how are you, honey?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - are you okay?

  - i could go if you want me to.

- que:
  - emmett?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i called ahead.

- que:
  - mrs. windham vandermark?

- que:
  - did your daughter ever mention anything... about the relationship between brooke and heyworth?
  ans:
  - she did say that they humped like gorillas.

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how many would you say?
  ans:
  - i have a point, i promise.

- que:
  - because they got wet?

  - really?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is there a possibility... that all potentials exist side by side?
  ans:
  - have you ever seen yourself through the eyes of someone else that you have become...

- que:
  - what is reality?
  ans:
  - i think the more you look at quantum physics... the more mysterious and wondrous it becomes.

- que:
  - have you ever thought about what thoughts are made of?
  ans:
  - every age, every generation has its built in assumptions

- que:
  - is everyone an enigma?
  ans:
  - they most certainly are.

- que:
  - isn't it amazing that we have options and potentials that exist... but we're unaware of them?
  ans:
  - we've been conditioned to believe... that the external world is more real than the internal world.

- que:
  - what is reality?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you know that the brain imprints what it has the ability to see?
  ans:
  - this is important.

- que:
  - so is it possible our eyes, our cameras... see more than what our brain... has the ability to consciously project?
  ans:
  - well, the way our brain is wired up... we only see what we believe is possible.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - i heard you scream earlier.

  - was it another dream?
  ans:
  - you were an indian... watching columbus's ship materialize out of thin air.

- que:
  - how long has it been since you played?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - how long has it been?
  ans:
  - i'll be late.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - remember, it's empty.

- que:
  - how do you know this shit?
  ans:
  - i read dr. quantum comics.

- que:
  - the question is, how far down the rabbit hole do you wanna go?
  ans:
  - nice shot.

- que:
  - how can a system or an object be in two or more states at the same time?
  ans:
  - it's very easy instead of thinking of things as things.

- que:
  - what's the big deal?
  ans:
  - you can see it right there.

- que:
  - and yet, there's this completely amazing magic... sitting right in front of your eyes.
  ans:
  - oh, well, what does that really mean?

- que:
  - is this then the observer?
  ans:
  - in my modeling, the observer is the spirit... inside the four layer biobodysuit.

- que:
  - there's no photographer.
  ans:
  - where the hell are you?

- que:
  - or a hot date?
  ans:
  - well, the chief of police went on television saying that...

- que:
  - this leads naturally to wonder do people are people affecting the world of reality that they see?
  ans:
  - you betcha they are.

- que:
  - but hurry, will ya, please?
  ans:
  - because these models are giving me a headache.

- que:
  - makes you wonder, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

- que:
  - if you accept with every rudiment of your being... that you will walk on water, will it happen?
  ans:
  - yes, it will.

- que:
  - you see how we are extending the image of ourselves?
  ans:
  - sucked.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - the day i make someone sane, they're in trouble.

- que:
  - it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

- que:
  - is there a substance of thought?
  ans:
  - i guess itjust depends on what you think is real.

- que:
  - guilty.
  ans:
  - are all realities in the quantum field existing simultaneously?

- que:
  - this is a good assignment, if you'd see it that way.
  ans:
  - a wedding?

- que:
  - what's to see?
  ans:
  - aw, god, amanda.

- que:
  - i took the pictures, remember?
  ans:
  - you got too many memories clouding your vision.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - you need a good polish wedding.

- que:
  - you mean the priests?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - how can any one little carbon unit... on earth in the backwaters of... indeed, the milky way, the boondocks... betray god almighty?
  ans:
  - that is impossible.

- que:
  - who is in the driver's seat when we control our emotions or we respond to our emotions?
  ans:
  - we know physiologically that nerve cells that fire together wire together.

- que:
  - does that mean emotions are good or emotions are bad?
  ans:
  - no, emotions are designed so that it reinforces chemically... something into long term memory.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - mixed.

- que:
  - got any tips?
  ans:
  - you won't do anything, so i will.

- que:
  - what are you standing there for?
  ans:
  - get out and serve.

- que:
  - so how can anyone really say they're in love with a specific person... for example?
  ans:
  - they're only in love with the anticipation... of the emotions they're addicted to.

- que:
  - my goodness, doesn't that change the landscape... of our emotional outlook on personal needs and identities?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - polacks they all look the same in a tux.

- que:
  - so, what's your name?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - what do we need?
  ans:
  - some foxes.

- que:
  - hello there, big boy.
  ans:
  - now... what about people who are addicted to sex?

- que:
  - i want to hear some hold on.
  ans:
  - is there a rocket in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?

- que:
  - would you not touch anything?
  ans:
  - that's very expensive equipment.

- que:
  - i want to hear some polka music, okay?
  ans:
  - these people want to hear some polka music.

- que:
  - what happens when we age?
  ans:
  - our skin gets loses elasticity.

- que:
  - what happens to our enzymes?
  ans:
  - we don't digest as well.

- que:
  - what happens to our synovial fluid?
  ans:
  - those are proteins that become brittle and stiff.

- que:
  - what happens to our bones?
  ans:
  - they become thin.

- que:
  - so then the question arises... does it really matter what we eat?
  ans:
  - if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

- que:
  - why do you have addictions?
  ans:
  - because you have nothing better.

- que:
  - do i think that you are bad?
  ans:
  - i don't think you're bad.

- que:
  - do i think you're good?
  ans:
  - they start to ask those questions.

- que:
  - what am i addicted to?
  ans:
  - hence the human drama.

- que:
  - you know why that is?
  ans:
  - it's because people have set up right and wrong.

- que:
  - does that mean you're in favor of sin and licentiousness and depravity?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is my life?
  ans:
  - consciousness of religion is something fundamental.

- que:
  - have you ever seen yourself... through the eyes of someone else that you have become?
  ans:
  - what an initiation.

- que:
  - have you ever stopped for a moment and looked at yourself... through the eyes of the ultimate observer?
  ans:
  - i am much more than i think i am.

- que:
  - how can we measure the effects?
  ans:
  - we get to live our life and see then if somewhere in our lives... something's changed.

- que:
  - how far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?
  ans:
  - ponder that for a while.

- que:
  - that's always a trick, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i should make it clear that i'm a graduate student in physics.

- que:
  - you're not, like, getting bored with things, are you?
  ans:
  - michelle, i...

- que:
  - is it kinky?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

  ans:
  - we're gonna be ushers at the wedding.

- que:
  - how was your trip?
  ans:
  - delightful.

- que:
  - who's excited about the wedding?
  ans:
  - anxious might be more accurate.

- que:
  - you brought your sons?
  ans:
  - our dogs.

- que:
  - well, honey, why don't you go get those critters out of the car and we'll start on some cocktails?
  ans:

  - hey, finch, you want this for here or to go?
  ans:
  - a witty saying proves nothing.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - hmm.

- que:
  - do you have the slightest idea of how important this is?
  ans:
  - we get to have a bachelor party.

  - michelle said the wedding was doable, right?
  ans:
  - a wedding.

  - what's the problem?
  ans:

  ans:
  - definitely.

- que:
  - how did walter kenton treat you after you told him you had alds?

  - ms. burton... weren't you recently promoted?
  ans:

- que:
  - excuse me, your honor, but is this for the record?
  ans:
  - mr. miller, perhaps you should return to counsel's table.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - no, i wasn't.

- que:
  - is andrew becket the kind of lawyer who misplaces crucial documents?
  ans:
  - not to my knowledge.

- que:
  - because they found out andy was sick?
  ans:
  - he's not answering the question.

- que:
  - did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally on purpose?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced?
  ans:
  - absolutely not.

- que:
  - suddenly counsel's attacking his own witness?
  ans:
  - please have a seat, miss conine.

- que:
  - would you approach the bench, mr. miller?
  ans:
  - could you kindly share with me... exactly what's going on inside your head... because at this moment, i don't have a clue.

- que:
  - because this case is not just about alds, is it?
  ans:
  - please have a seat, mr. miller.

- que:
  - with all due respect, your honor... we don't live in this courtroom, though, do we?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yes, we did.

- que:
  - you were aware when you worked with melissa benedict... that she had alds, correct?
  ans:
  - she didn't try to conceal it.

- que:
  - correct?
  ans:
  - beckett told me he had been hit by a racket ball, and i believed him.

- que:
  - did you avoid contact with ms. benedict after you found out she had alds?
  ans:
  - she says and i quote, that you were repulsed by her.

- que:
  - is that correct?
  ans:
  - don't move now.

- que:
  - can we just skip the treatment for tonight?
  ans:
  - no.

  ans:
  - we re both nervous.

- que:
  - would you cut that out, please?
  ans:
  - you re having a stress reaction.

- que:
  - those noises we re hearing, that s normal?
  ans:
  - those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub s integrity.

- que:
  - you know a little something about that, don t you, norman?
  ans:
  - how the pressure can attack your integrity.

- que:
  - that s the helium.
  ans:
  - were you nice last time?

- que:
  - was i the only one paying attention?
  ans:
  - oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...... hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.

  ans:
  - i don t speak balloon.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:

  ans:
  - excuse me, ted.

- que:
  - tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
  ans:
  - this is habitat to navy dive.

- que:
  - why do you say that?
  ans:
  - we assume they il be green...... or insect like, but basically human.

- que:
  - but why would you assume that a ulf would want to kill us?
  ans:
  - an immortal creature wouldn t think killing was right or wrong.

- que:
  - you did put that in your report?
  ans:
  - lt s in there.

- que:
  - what if you have to go to the bathroom?
  ans:

- que:
  - can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door?
  ans:
  - maybe it s the hydraulics.

- que:
  - what is it, harry?
  ans:
  - take a look.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - l thought you said this thing wasn t damaged when it crashed...... that this titanium alloy was so super strong, you can t hurt it.

- que:
  - ls there heat coming off this thing?
  ans:
  - you re right.

- que:
  - how did that happen?
  ans:
  - l m not sure about the atmosphere.

- que:
  - time to turn back?
  ans:
  - l m a little curious.

- que:
  - split up?
  ans:
  - he s got a point.

- que:
  - you made up the report?
  ans:
  - no, not all of it.

- que:
  - who did the other half?
  ans:
  - i borrowed from, you know, good writers.

- que:
  - rod serling?
  ans:
  - who would ve thought anyone even reads those government reports.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - this is barnes, norman.

- que:
  - what the hell is it?
  ans:
  - whatever it is, it seems to be what this bird was designed to do.

- que:
  - yeah, but back from where?
  ans:
  - don t get too excited, ted.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - when pope benedict asked giotto to prove his worth as an artist...... giotto drew a perfect circle...... freehand.

- que:
  - something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
  ans:
  - what s that?

- que:
  - have you forgotten the trojan horse?
  ans:
  - it could be a trap.

- que:
  - don t you think that s a little paranoid?
  ans:
  - no, l m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.

- que:
  - yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn t it?
  ans:
  - except mercury s liquid at this temperature.

- que:
  - what do you think it is?
  ans:
  - i don t know.

- que:
  - why wasn t it damaged?
  ans:
  - the materials are obviously super strong.

- que:
  - lf that s true, why did it chip when you hit it?
  ans:
  - it didn t crash.

- que:
  - from where?
  ans:
  - not  where.  when.

- que:
  - so you re saying this thing took a wrong turn?
  ans:
  - that s right.

- que:
  - i mean, what if the craft...... inadvertently flew into a black hole?
  ans:
  - lt s possible, but not plausible.

- que:
  - what part of  pull out  don t you understand?
  ans:
  - extraction.

- que:
  - you re leaving a time traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
  ans:
  - l m just following my orders.

- que:
  - what s your point?
  ans:
  - my point is, l m a biochemist and there s no life down here.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i don t know.

- que:
  - do you not have an opinion about this?
  ans:
  - l m delighted we re going back up top.

- que:
  - you know what i mean?
  ans:
  - let s go home.

- que:
  - you mean, wrong about the storm?
  ans:
  - no, about the sphere.

- que:
  - what about the sphere?
  ans:
  - lt s alive.

- que:
  - why do you say that?
  ans:
  - there s something inside it.

- que:
  - how can there be anything inside it?
  ans:
  - there s no door, no seams.

- que:
  - doesn t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
  ans:
  - pop psychology.

- que:
  - you really think so?
  ans:
  - i don t know.

- que:
  - ted did figure it out first, didn t he?
  ans:
  - good shrinkage.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you see, it s curious.

- que:
  - why don t they know?
  ans:
  - lf they don t know...... it means we never told anyone.

- que:
  - what s wrong?
  ans:
  - talk to mr. barnes.

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - video feed room.

- que:
  - where is that?
  ans:
  - i don t know where the hell anything is.

- que:
  - what s going on?
  ans:
  - i don t know.

- que:
  - what the hell is he doing?
  ans:
  - i don t know.

- que:
  - do you know what he s doing?
  ans:
  - i need to know what you know.

- que:
  - he said,  inside.  what? lnside the spacecraft?
  ans:
  - i think inside the sphere.

- que:
  - did he go inside?
  ans:
  - i don t think so.

- que:
  - what the hell s going on?
  ans:

  - with your $282, 000?

- que:
  - did you receive that file, sir?
  ans:
  - i don't remember seeing it.

- que:
  - muir?

  - muir?
  ans:
  - it's kind of difficult to explain.

- que:
  - what the hell is that?

  - aiken, where did you leave off yesterday?
  ans:
  - beirut, sir.

- que:
  - don't you have any leads?
  ans:

  ans:
  - it's a goddamn list.

- que:
  - i didn't know the name of that victim had been released?

  ans:
  - loyalty.

- que:
  - it's all the same... piece of shit without that, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it's the end of everything.

- que:

  ans:
  - just take it.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i drove it, joe.

- que:
  - why did he go through this trouble to cut firehouses?
  ans:
  - when a firehouse closes, swayzak converts it into a community center.

- que:
  - lakeside dynamics, remember them?
  ans:
  - they get all the expensive construction work.

- que:
  - mr. swayzak?
  ans:
  - gas.

- que:
  - that's quite a bunch of guys, huh?
  ans:
  - i'm so goddamn helpless here.

- que:
  - what do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - we're close.

- que:
  - it's a collectible.
  ans:
  - it must've looked like it was going to be... a medium deal, didn't it, when your father bought it?

- que:
  - who's doing this, ronald?
  ans:
  - wrong question.

- que:
  - it isn't a spark, is it?
  ans:
  - because there isn't enough damage... and he wouldn't have had any fun.

- que:
  - how does he talk to the fire?
  ans:
  - the outlets.

- que:
  - you still haven't put it together?
  ans:
  - i have.

- que:
  - you wanna know who?
  ans:
  - i wanna know... if this kid really wanted to be... just like his dad.

- que:
  - did he?
  ans:
  - it did.

- que:
  - so... whoever did this, really knows the animal well, don't they?
  ans:
  - they know him real well but they won't let him loose.

- que:
  - that wasn't such a long walk after all, was it?
  ans:
  - oh, god.

- que:
  - i mean, where you going?
  ans:
  - look, i gotta i gotta get back.

  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - stephen.

- que:
  - i should've let you in on it.
  ans:
  - you burned people!

- que:
  - in on murder?
  ans:
  - that was an accident.

- que:
  - why'd you have to go in there so fucking early?
  ans:
  - that's why you wanted me to wait.

- que:
  - what would he say about what you do?
  ans:
  - swayzak.

- que:
  - what the fuck would you do?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - uh huh.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - let's move it.

- que:
  - brian?
  ans:

  ans:
  - that's your career dissipation light.

- que:
  - got it, cap?
  ans:
  - okay, into the truck.

- que:
  - perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
  ans:
  - it begins on a dark night... where a dark man waits with a dark purpose.

- que:
  - you have it then?
  ans:
  - i had to slit a few throats, but i got it.

- que:
  - jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?
  ans:
  - shh.

- que:
  - who disturbs my slumber?
  ans:
  - it is i, gazeem, a humble thief.

- que:
  - what are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - we got a big problem here, a big...

- que:
  - you think that was easy?
  ans:
  - you two, over that way, and you, follow me.

- que:
  - getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, aladdin?
  ans:
  - trouble no way.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - on his way to the palace, i suppose.

- que:
  - you're not leaving so soon, are you?
  ans:
  - good luck marrying her off.

- que:
  - you were just playing with that overdressed, self absorbed prince achmed, weren't you?
  ans:
  - dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - i don't know where she gets it from.

- que:
  - uh, my ring?
  ans:
  - but it's been in the family for years.

  ans:
  - just play along.

- que:
  - you, uh, know this girl?
  ans:
  - sadly, yes.

- que:
  - tragic, isn't it?
  ans:
  - but no harm done.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - with all due respect, your rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
  ans:
  - save your breath, lago.

- que:
  - let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?
  ans:
  - swell.

- que:
  - is it that obvious?
  ans:
  - well, you do kind of stand out.

- que:
  - is this where you live?
  ans:
  - yep.

  ans:
  - oh, it's wonderful.

- que:
  - what sentence?
  ans:
  - death.

- que:
  - so, how did it go?
  ans:
  - i think she took it... rather well.

- que:
  - i'm a street rat, remember?
  ans:
  - and there's a law.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - a lowly prisoner, like yourself.

- que:
  - jafar, can you hurry up?
  ans:
  - but the law says only a prince can...

- que:
  - you've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?
  ans:
  - whoever has the gold makes the rules.

- que:
  - why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - so, what's your assessment, velmster?
  ans:
  - this place seems harmless enough.

- que:
  - i mean, whether the evil masked figure could've gotten his randamonium...... from here at the mine?
  ans:
  - oh, sorry.

- que:
  - so your assessment is?
  ans:
  - love stinks.

- que:
  - do you think i'm just a pretty face?
  ans:

  - why would you even use that word?
  ans:

  - henchmen?
  ans:
  - young man, we're investors, and we're listening to his pitch.

- que:
  - then how come there was randamonium on the floor of your mansion?
  ans:
  - there's randamonium all over the place.

- que:
  - jacobo?
  ans:
  - we hated each other.

- que:
  - then why did we find the monster book in your library?
  ans:
  - wait a second.

- que:
  - which one of you stole my toilet brush?
  ans:
  - gentlemen.

- que:
  - look at those weird letters, scoob.
  ans:
  - what happened?

- que:
  - shaggy?
  ans:
  - scooby doo, you turned into a freaky monster.

- que:
  - that was almost exactly like my freshman year in college.
  ans:
  - a what?

- que:
  - what are you guys doing here?
  ans:
  - you're supposed to be sick, scooby.

- que:
  - what's over here?
  ans:
  - this light is strange.

- que:
  - you girls find anything?
  ans:

  - you almost had me there, didn't you?
  ans:
  - lucky for her, she had an assistant helping her with her evil plans.

- que:

  ans:
  - good morning, starshine.

  ans:
  - mr. wonka, i don't know if you'll remember me...... but i used to work here in the factory.

  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - don't you want to know our names?
  ans:

  ans:
  - exactly the same.

- que:
  - are the oompa loompas really joking?
  ans:
  - of course they're joking.

- que:
  - what's so funny?
  ans:
  - i think it's from all those doggone cocoa beans.

- que:
  - hey, by the way, did you guys know that chocolate contains a property...... that triggers the release of endorphins?
  ans:
  - gives one the feeling of being in love.

- que:
  - you're all quite short, aren't you?
  ans:
  - well, yeah.

- que:

- que:
  - what's so funny?
  ans:
  - i think it's from all those doggone cocoa beans.

- que:
  - hey, by the way, did you guys know that chocolate contains a property...... that triggers the release of endorphins?
  ans:
  - gives one the feeling of being in love.

- que:
  - you're all quite short, aren't you?
  ans:
  - well, yeah.

- que:
  - know why?
  ans:
  - because i distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head.

- que:
  - do you even remember what it was like being a kid?
  ans:
  - oh, boy, do l.

- que:
  - do l?
  ans:
  - ruthie, veronica, terrance.

- que:
  - and who's that under the sheet?
  ans:
  - little willy wonka.

- que:
  - now...... iet's see what the damage is this year, shall we?
  ans:
  - caramels.

- que:
  - they'd get stuck in your braces, wouldn't they?
  ans:
  - lollipops.

- que:
  - mr. wonka?
  ans:
  - we're headed for a tunnel.

- que:
  - how can they see where they're going?
  ans:
  - they can't.

- que:
  - what do you use hair cream for?
  ans:
  - to lock in moisture.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - hey, mr. wonka, what's this?
  ans:
  - let me show you.

- que:
  - lsn't that neat?
  ans:
  - it's like gum.

- que:
  - who wants a beard?
  ans:
  - well...... beatniks, for one.

- que:
  - can you dig what i'm laying down?
  ans:
  - you look great.

- que:
  - you mean that's it?
  ans:
  - it's gum.

- que:
  - know why?
  ans:
  - because this gum is a full three course dinner all by itself.

- que:
  - why would anyone want that?
  ans:
  - it will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking.

- que:
  - that part.
  ans:
  - how is it, honey?

- que:
  - what's happening to her nose?
  ans:
  - it's turning blue.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - violet, you're turning violet.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - well, i told you i hadn't quite got it right.

- que:
  - what's happening to me?
  ans:
  - she's swelling up.

- que:
  - how is she supposed to compete?
  ans:
  - they're gonna squeeze her.

- que:
  - why did you decide to let people in?
  ans:
  - so they could see the factory, of course.

- que:
  - what's the special prize, and who gets it?
  ans:
  - the best kind of prize is a surprise.

- que:
  - will violet always be a blueberry?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - if you hate gum so much, why do you make it?
  ans:
  - once again, you shouldn't mumble.

- que:
  - can you remember the first candy you ever ate?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - these flashbacks happen often?
  ans:
  - increasingly...... today.

- que:
  - are you using the havermax 4000 to do your sorting?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not use oompa loompas?
  ans:
  - because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time.

- que:
  - see how they tap them with their knuckles to make sure it's not bad?
  ans:
  - oh, look.

- que:
  - mr. wonka, how much do you want for one of these squirrels?
  ans:
  - name your price.

- que:
  - little girl?
  ans:
  - veruca, come back here at once.

- que:
  - little girl?
  ans:
  - don't touch that squirrel's nuts.

- que:
  - what are they doing?
  ans:
  - where all the other bad nuts go.

- que:
  - where does the chute go?
  ans:
  - to the incinerator.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - oh, good.

- que:
  - how do you know, mr. smarty pants?
  ans:
  - this isn't just an ordinary up and down elevator, by the way.

- que:
  - why is everything here completely pointless?
  ans:
  - candy doesn't have to have a point.

- que:
  - and we certainly don't want that, now, do we?
  ans:
  - television chocolate.

- que:
  - why can't i send a real bar of chocolate through the television, ready to be eaten?
  ans:
  - i'm not gonna touch it.

- que:
  - it's gotta be real big because you know how on tv...... you can film a regular size man, and he comes out looking this tall?
  ans:
  - same basic principle.

- que:
  - do you have any idea what breakfast cereal's made of?
  ans:
  - it's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners.

- que:
  - but could you send it by tv if you wanted to?
  ans:
  - of course i could.

- que:
  - well, why would i wanna send a person?
  ans:
  - they don't taste very good at all.

- que:
  - don't you realize what you've invented?
  ans:
  - it's a teleporter.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - well, sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through.

- que:
  - what kind of a question is that?
  ans:
  - no need to snap.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - just put me back in the other way.

- que:
  - and what exactly do you propose to do about it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - taffy puller?
  ans:
  - hey, that was my idea.

- que:
  - i want you to take mr. teavee and his...... iittle boy up to the taffy puller, okay?
  ans:
  - stretch him out.

- que:
  - now, how many children are left?
  ans:
  - mr. wonka, charlie's the only one left now.

- que:
  - you mean, you're the only one?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what happened to the others?
  ans:
  - oh, my dear boy, but that means you've won.

- que:
  - what kind of room is that?
  ans:
  - hold on.

- que:
  - break through what?
  ans:
  - i've been longing to press that button for years.

- que:
  - but do you really mean?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - where do you live?
  ans:
  - right over there.

- que:
  - what time do you think they'll be back?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - who would watch over them after i was gone?
  ans:
  - i must find a heir.

- que:
  - what are oompa loompas?
  ans:
  - i invited five children to the factory...... and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner.

- que:
  - are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - i mean, it's all right if my family come too?
  ans:
  - oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

- que:
  - so if i go with you to the factory, i won't ever see my family again?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - sure you won't change your mind?
  ans:
  - i make the candy i feel like, but now i feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

- que:
  - you ever met him?
  ans:
  - i don't feel so hot.

- que:
  - what makes you feel better when you feel terrible?
  ans:
  - my family.

- que:
  - what do you have against my family?
  ans:
  - it's not just your family.

- que:
  - my father?
  ans:
  - no way.

- que:
  - you want me to go with you?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - do you have an appointment?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - now, let's see what the damage is, shall we?
  ans:
  - heavens.

- que:
  - willy?
  ans:
  - hi, dad.

- que:
  - you staying for dinner, willy?
  ans:
  - yes, please.

- que:
  - how do you feel about little raspberry kites?
  ans:
  - with licorice instead of string.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - ahh... we have sort of a problem here.

- que:
  - did you see the memo about this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - um...

- que:
  - milton?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - uh... could you turn that down just a little bit?
  ans:
  - but i was told that i could listen... to the radio at a reasonable volume from 9:00 to 11:00.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - we need to talk about your t. p. s. reports.

- que:
  - did you get that memo?
  ans:
  - i swear to god, one of these days....

- que:
  - wow! ls that your real name?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so are you related to that singer guy?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why should i change?
  ans:
  - he's the one who sucks.

- que:
  - wanna go to chotchkie's, get some coffee?
  ans:
  - just coffee.

- que:
  - uh, yeah, well, i work at lnitech... and i don't consider myself a pussy, ok?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - if you're so obsessed with her, why don't you just ask her out?
  ans:
  - oh, i can't do that.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna see this occupational hypnotherapist with anne.

- que:
  - dude, an occupational hypnotherapist?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - what is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - why don't you just tell anne that you're not into hypnosis... and you wanna play poker with us?
  ans:
  - i can't do that.

- que:
  - hey, and speaking of problems... what's this i hear about you having problems... with your t. p. s. reports?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what's he doing?
  ans:
  - i knew it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's a staff meeting.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - we're all screwed.

- que:
  - how do i know?
  ans:
  - they're bringing in a consultant.

- que:
  - you know there are people in this world... that don't have to put up with all this shit?
  ans:
  - like that guy that invented the pet rock.

- que:
  - you think the pet rock was a really great idea?
  ans:
  - sure it was.

- que:
  - what was it, tom?
  ans:
  - well, all right.

- que:
  - so what did you say?
  ans:
  - i never had an answer.

- que:
  - lawrence, can't you just pretend...
  ans:
  - you know what i would do if i had a million dollars?

- que:
  - oh, sorry, man!
  ans:
  - no, but...

- que:
  - doesn't that chick look like anne?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - i don't know, man.

- que:
  - well... when a boss wants you to work on saturday... he generally asks you at the end of the day, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - lawrence, what would you do if you had a million dollars?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you what i'd do, man.

- que:
  - if you had a million dollars... you'd do two chicks at the same time?
  ans:
  - damn straight.

- que:
  - besides two chicks at the same time?
  ans:
  - well, yeah.

  ans:
  - and if not, that's cool, too.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - what you do at lnitech... is you take the specifications from the customers... and you bring them down to the software engineers?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - well, then i just have to ask... why couldn't the customers... just take them directly to the software people, huh?
  ans:
  - well, i'll tell you why.

- que:
  - so... you physically take the specs from the customer?
  ans:
  - well... no.

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - won't you get fired?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  ans:
  - about an hour ago.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - i don't think i'd like another job.

  - can we order lunch first?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:

  ans:
  - thanks a bunch, milton.

- que:
  - what the hell's going on, man?
  ans:
  - i thought you'd come in here and start shooting.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - peter, would you be a good sport... and indulge us and just... tell us a little more?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - it's a problem of motivation, all right?
  ans:
  - now, if i work my ass off... and lnitech ships a few extra units...

- que:
  - so where's the motivation?
  ans:
  - and here's something else, bob...

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - eight bosses.

- que:
  - eight?
  ans:
  - eight, bob.

- que:
  - would you bear with me for just a second, please?

  - well, fifteen is the minimum, ok?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - ok, so you want me to wear more?
  ans:
  - look, joanna...

- que:
  - people can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok?
  ans:
  - they come to chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attitude.

- que:
  - you do want to express yourself, don't you?
  ans:
  - y yeah.

- que:
  - who's he?
  ans:
  - you know, squirrelly looking guy.

- que:
  - so, uh, milton has been let go?
  ans:
  - just a second there, professor.

- que:
  - how much time would you say you spend each week... dealing with these t. p. s. reports?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so i guess we should probably go ahead... and have a little talk, hmm?
  ans:
  - not right now, lumbergh, i'm i'm kinda busy.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - i i didn't receive my paycheck this week.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - uh, excuse me...

- que:
  - you're gonna layoff samir and michael?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do they know this yet?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so you're going to fire michael and samir... and give me more money?
  ans:
  - uh huh.

- que:
  - what are you doing tonight?
  ans:
  - uh, no offense there, peter... but speak for yourself there, sport.

- que:
  - well, how does it work?
  ans:
  - it's pretty brilliant.

- que:
  - so, michael, what's to stop you from doing this?
  ans:
  - it's not worth the risk.

- que:
  - and you're gonna go in tomorrow... they're gonna throw you out on the street.
  ans:
  - what if you didn't have a good job?

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:
  - so bill lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point.

- que:
  - your software works, right?
  ans:
  - of course it works.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - for another job where they can fire you for no reason?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - aren't you?
  ans:
  - yes, but i'm not going to do anything illegal.

- que:
  - illegal?
  ans:
  - samir, this is america.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so what do you think?
  ans:
  - this thing is actually pretty fail safe, samir.

- que:
  - samir?
  ans:
  - you came here looking for a land of opportunity.

- que:
  - what's it gonna be?
  ans:
  - i have a question.

- que:
  - in this conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?
  ans:
  - ok, yeah, good, right.

- que:
  - we have to swear to god, allah... that nobody knows about this but us, all right?
  ans:
  - no family members, no girlfriends.

- que:
  - what the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - don't worry.

- que:
  - that he got laid off?
  ans:
  - no, man, check it out.

- que:
  - peter:ls he dead?
  ans:

- que:
  - you ok, tom?
  ans:
  - yeah, i think i'm ok.

- que:
  - is he ok?
  ans:
  - sort of.

- que:
  - what did you steal?
  ans:
  - i'm driving.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - it's fun, and it's exciting.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - joanna's coming over.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - monday morning, we're gonna check the account balance.

- que:
  - what were you guys celebrating last night?
  ans:
  - oh, um... l'm not really at liberty to talk about it.

- que:
  - so you're stealing?
  ans:
  - uh, no.

- que:
  - so you're gonna make a lot of money, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - it's not yours?
  ans:
  - uh... well, it becomes ours.

- que:
  - how is that not stealing?
  ans:
  - i don't think i'm explaining this very well.

- que:
  - um, the 7 eleven, right?
  ans:
  - you'd take a penny from the tray.

- que:
  - from the crippled children?
  ans:
  - no, that's the jar.

- que:
  - i'm just talking about fractions of a penny, ok?
  ans:
  - but we do it from a much bigger tray... and we do it a couple of million times.

- que:
  - so what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - initech is an evil corporation, all right?
  ans:
  - chotchkie's is wrong.

- que:
  - doesn't it bother you that you have to get up in the morning... and you have to put on a bunch of pieces of flair?
  ans:
  - yeah, but i'm not about to go in and start... taking money from the register.

- que:
  - we don't have to talk about this now.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - let's just go to the barbecue, all right?
  ans:
  - i'm glad you could make it.

- que:
  - well... what do you think?
  ans:
  - it's a prototype.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - conjugal visits?
  ans:
  - not that i know of.

- que:
  - drew.
  ans:
  - why do you ask, anyway?

- que:
  - that's something about old smykowski, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - hey, isn't that the girl that works over at chotchkie's?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - who's she here with?
  ans:
  - she's with me.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - are you kidding me?
  ans:
  - she gets around.

- que:
  - she does, does she?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah, like a record.

- que:
  - like with who?
  ans:
  - oh, let's see, uh...

- que:
  - what if you get caught?
  ans:
  - oh, i just don't know if this was such a good idea.

- que:
  - peter, what is wrong with you?
  ans:
  - that was, like, two years ago.

- que:
  - did you know him?
  ans:
  - yeah, i know him.

- que:
  - hey, that is none of your business, ok?
  ans:
  - i didn't ask you who you slept with before we were together.

- que:

  ans:
  - your security clearance is higher than ours.

- que:
  - i have security clearance?
  ans:
  - we're just here to bring you to your jet.

- que:
  - i have a jet?
  ans:
  - hey, serge.

- que:
  - what am i doing here?
  ans:
  - they wouldn't brief me until you got here.

- que:
  - when are you going to meet a nice girl and bring her for dinner?
  ans:
  - i'm married to my work.

- que:
  - tom purcell.
  ans:
  - you're... you're teasing me, right?

- que:
  - gentlemen, you do realize that everything here is totally classified, okay?
  ans:
  - at 10:30 a. m. local time, 32 civilians, all within a 10 block radius... died.

- que:
  - nerve agent?
  ans:
  - our first guess.

- que:
  - they all died at the same time?
  ans:
  - as far as we can tell, to the second.

- que:
  - ls there a variation in sex, age, body type?
  ans:
  - they all had pacemakers.

- que:
  - without any clues from the victims?
  ans:
  - no, that's...

- que:
  - now i need to know, did some sort of weapon kill these people?
  ans:
  - look at my hat.

- que:
  - what is it, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - no, no, no, the long range stuff.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - acker.

- que:
  - what are we doing?
  ans:
  - i need a 3 d computer model of the earth to lay the field over.

- que:
  - whoa ho ho, the planet earth?
  ans:
  - yeah, the planet earth.

- que:
  - listen, josh, do we even have time for this?
  ans:
  - do this and i'll sign your doctorates blindfolded.

- que:
  - blindfolded?
  ans:
  - blindfolded.

- que:
  - give me some drag, will you?
  ans:
  - roger that.

- que:
  - weren't able to annoy the commander into letting you bring her in this time?
  ans:
  - that's a negative, stick.

- que:
  - ls that even possible?
  ans:
  - endeavour, we see you in good entry config.

- que:
  - where the hell are we?
  ans:
  - endeavour, guidance is bad.

- que:
  - ls that...?
  ans:
  - los angeles.

- que:
  - the guidance, the beacons are all wrong?
  ans:
  - we're heading straight for downtown.

- que:
  - bob, you know l. a.?
  ans:
  - because i have an idea.

- que:
  - can you clear a freeway?
  ans:
  - okay, thank you.

- que:
  - houston?
  ans:
  - computers are still plotting.

- que:
  - all right, beck, what do you got?
  ans:
  - houston, i have coordinates for an alternate landing site.

- que:
  - can you confirm?
  ans:
  - endeavour, give them to me.

- que:
  - bill?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - what's your name?
  ans:
  - josh keyes.

- que:
  - young man, do you have any idea who i am?
  ans:
  - yes, i do, sir.

- que:
  - what's it about?
  ans:
  - it's the end of the world.

- que:
  - rebecca?
  ans:
  - only you and dad ever call me that.

- que:
  - so, what brings you to sunny d. c.?
  ans:
  - the board of review is next week.

- que:
  - how bad is it?
  ans:
  - your crew crashed the space shuttle.

- que:
  - now, how good do you think it could be?
  ans:
  - sir, this is my life.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - it's like the 4th of july.

- que:
  - rebecca, would you excuse me, please?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - did zimsky really try to give you his autograph?
  ans:
  - ah, monsieur zimsky.

- que:
  - weren't you the one?
  ans:
  - i spoke with the kids.

- que:
  - ls there any chance you're wrong?
  ans:
  - we'd be grateful if you could join us for a ride, sir.

- que:
  - and if i were to say no?
  ans:
  - just asking.

- que:
  - but now...?
  ans:
  - but now, that field is falling apart.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - this here.

- que:
  - does somebody have a can of air freshener?
  ans:
  - quick and dirty.

- que:
  - are you following me?
  ans:
  - the inner core is, uh... well, it's a big, solid chunk of iron, we think.

- que:
  - how could this have happened?
  ans:
  - we don't know.

- que:
  - what's the timeline here?
  ans:
  - as the em field becomes more and more unstable, we'll start seeing isolated incidents.

- que:
  - would you?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - may l?
  ans:
  - feel free to throw up.

- que:
  - so, how do we fix it?
  ans:
  - we can't.

- que:
  - ... what if we could?
  ans:
  - hello, braz.

- que:
  - why the hell aren't you dead yet?
  ans:
  - okay, this way.

- que:
  - have you begun to think about a shell?
  ans:
  - okay, this is alex.

- que:
  - what do you call this material?
  ans:
  - well, its real name has 37 syilables.

- que:
  - unobtainium?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - theoretically?
  ans:
  - theoretically, yes.

- que:
  - excuse me, dr. brazzleton, when do you think the ship will be operational?
  ans:
  - when i get my fabrication methods perfected... 12... ten years, ten years.

- que:
  - what would it take to get it done in three months?
  ans:
  - $15 billion.

- que:
  - why don't you use a credit card?
  ans:
  - you get miles.

- que:
  - you guys aren't here to whack me, are you?
  ans:
  - because i was really, really hoping to have sex before that happened.

- que:
  - excuse me, but is this really the best we could do?
  ans:
  - i mean...

- que:
  - how many languages do you speak?
  ans:
  - five, actually.

- que:
  - do you have any idea...?
  ans:
  - okay, hey.

- que:
  - what kind of help?
  ans:
  - lnformation control.

- que:
  - you want me to hack the planet?
  ans:
  - he wants me to hack the planet.

- que:
  - hot pockets?
  ans:
  - they help me concentrate.

- que:
  - you and you alone were responsible for proposing the descent vectors for the shuttle, correct?
  ans:
  - yes, general.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - so, how are you holding up?
  ans:
  - oh, hi.

- que:
  - why did he touch his tie like that?
  ans:
  - thomas, let me speak with you for a moment.

- que:
  - listen, wouldn't you rather i did this?
  ans:
  - i mean, given my reputation, i think that...

- que:
  - terranauts?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - it's the simplest things that are the hardest, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - can i help you?
  ans:
  - yes, please.

- que:
  - you're an astronaut, and you can tie a windsor?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - ls there anything you can't do?
  ans:
  - not that i'm aware of.

- que:
  - a thousand megatons, give or take?
  ans:
  - tops.

- que:
  - braz, do you think the ship can handle five of these babies?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - lsn't that going to affect the way the explosions are...?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, yes, yes.

- que:
  - and what if the core is made of cheese?
  ans:
  - this is all best guess, commander.

- que:
  - ls ejection really the best option?
  ans:
  - for the 22nd time in a row, everyone on earth is dead.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - well, it's...

- que:
  - apocalypse boy?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - this is really cool, but can i just...?
  ans:
  - well... mm hmm.

- que:
  - crashing one ship isn't enough for you?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - what makes you think i'm not?
  ans:
  - because you're so good.

- que:
  - josh, do you mind?
  ans:
  - no, not at all.

- que:
  - virgil the poet that led our man into the depths of hell?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - what's our depth?
  ans:
  - 1, 600 feet, plenty of room on both sides.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - let's increase impeller speed.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - t phase.

- que:
  - still think the water launch was a good idea?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, i chose this location because the crust is thin here.

- que:
  - you see that rock?
  ans:
  - that is not good.

- que:
  - can't.
  ans:
  - what do you mean, pressure?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we're locked in.

- que:
  - but what if we hit bottom in ten seconds here?
  ans:
  - just give it a couple more seconds.

- que:
  - assuming?
  ans:
  - yes, assuming.

- que:
  - virgil, can we get a status check?
  ans:
  - we're about to make the transition into the mantle.

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - i said...

- que:
  - an obligation to make a book deal perhaps?
  ans:
  - two book deals, if you'd like to know the truth.

- que:
  - when did you learn how to read?
  ans:
  - people.

- que:
  - drs. zimsky and keyes?
  ans:
  - you guys are our resident geophysicists.

- que:
  - what do you make of this?
  ans:
  - the mantle is a chemical hodgepodge of... a variety of elements...

- que:
  - so what's... what's static?
  ans:
  - it's nothing.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - it's nothing.

- que:
  - serge, you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - anybody hurt?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - from the cooling system.

- que:
  - where in god's name are we?
  ans:
  - whatever has us jammed up is inside our lasers.

- que:
  - josh, is there any other image you can pull up?
  ans:
  - nope.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - believe me, i hate to admit it, but i think he's right.

- que:
  - the cooling system that's keeping us from roasting to death in this ship?
  ans:
  - well, just a small part of it.

- que:
  - alternatives?
  ans:
  - anybody.

- que:
  - where the hell are we?
  ans:
  - well, the good news is, it looks like the suits can take the pressure.

- que:
  - beck, try the lights, will you?
  ans:
  - lighting up.

- que:
  - cobalt shell, maybe?
  ans:
  - no. l i mean, in a magma environment of 5, 000 degrees.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - we're inside a giant gem bubble, wrapped in a cobalt cocoon 700 miles below the surface of the earth.

- que:
  - braz, what can i do?
  ans:
  - check the feeds for me.

- que:
  - okay, guys, connect the oxygen.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - braz, you got that?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - bob?
  ans:
  - you're going to be weak.

- que:
  - i'm going to check your heartbeat, okay?
  ans:
  - thanks, braz.

- que:
  - so, that's the bad news?
  ans:
  - that's not too bad.

- que:
  - let's give him a second, okay?
  ans:
  - he deserves that.

- que:
  - oh, god, this all just seems too big, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - i think you were attempting the impossible.

- que:
  - hey... who's steering the ship?
  ans:
  - video screen autopilot.

- que:
  - you're not from the cla, or the nsa or any of those three letter places?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - key's in, dr. brazzleton.

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - we're not supposed to go through anything black.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - they're scattered everywhere.

- que:
  - diamonds?
  ans:
  - i want some.

- que:
  - we're not going to forget about you, man.
  ans:
  - can i help?

- que:
  - josh, i can't see you.
  ans:
  - josh, can you hear me?

- que:
  - braz is going to override the doors manually, okay?
  ans:
  - we're working on it right now.

- que:
  - braz, how long?
  ans:
  - going as fast as i can, fast as i can.

- que:
  - beck, override the ejection systems, okay?
  ans:
  - we're not going to forget about you, man.

- que:
  - we're working on it, all right?
  ans:
  - stay with me here.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i don't know what to do.

- que:
  - can you hear me now?
  ans:
  - all right, here i am.

- que:
  - i'm going to come to paris and we'll go out, all right?
  ans:
  - after this.

- que:
  - did you reset the overrides?
  ans:
  - i never pushed them.

- que:
  - actually, you really want to know?
  ans:
  - i killed him twice.

- que:
  - do you want me to feel any worse about that than i already do?
  ans:
  - it's not possible.

- que:
  - could you have made the decision?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - could you?
  ans:
  - yes, i could've.

- que:
  - josh, can you hear me?
  ans:
  - ready as we'll ever be, stick.

- que:
  - would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation?
  ans:
  - please tell me this is enough.

- que:
  - you're telling me the 1, 000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isn't going to cut it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the energy waves from the explosion won't spread far enough.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - our commander is dead.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - general, this is dr. conrad zimsky.

- que:
  - now what the hell is destiny?
  ans:
  - it's a device.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - so... we built one, too.

- que:
  - zimsky, what makes you think that destiny would even touch the core?
  ans:
  - this isn't a fluke.

- que:
  - why weren't we notified of this, sir?
  ans:
  - because you didn't need to know, major.

- que:
  - so the device that killed the planet is your backup plan?
  ans:
  - an electric shock can stop a heart.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid it's all we've got.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - well, plan c.

- que:
  - rebecca?
  ans:
  - it's the em monitoring station.

- que:
  - remember those invisible microwaves that josh was talking about?
  ans:
  - well, they just found a hole.

- que:
  - what are you laughing at?
  ans:
  - no, i mean, it took me and 400 of the world's smartest people to come up with the first plan.

- que:
  - you want to help?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - braz, no, look, i have a theory.
  ans:
  - what's v?

- que:
  - are you interested?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - all right, fine, look.

- que:
  - look, we have to use wave interference, okay?
  ans:
  - because one explosion won't do it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - virgil's not designed to eject undamaged compartments.

- que:
  - where's the master gear?
  ans:
  - ln the crawl space we used to get out earlier.

- que:
  - well, what the hell is it doing there?
  ans:
  - i built the ship in three damn months.

- que:
  - can you flush it with liquid nitrogen?
  ans:
  - we don't have enough at this point.

- que:
  - and our suits are built to withstand...?
  ans:
  - half that, probably.

- que:
  - just a moment, may i see that?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - may l?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why do you get dibs on being the hero?
  ans:
  - because it's my damn ship.

- que:
  - yes, conrad?
  ans:
  - you're right.

- que:
  - damn me?
  ans:
  - too late.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - gotcha!... four, three, two...

- que:
  - oh, hey, general.
  ans:
  - well, how long will it take to get it back online?

- que:
  - ls there something i can do for you?
  ans:
  - the last bomb is not enough.

- que:
  - where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium?
  ans:
  - i think the flare has knocked the coms out.

- que:
  - can you hear me?
  ans:
  - i'm correcting course.

- que:
  - beck.
  ans:
  - can you hear me?

- que:
  - beck, can you hear me?
  ans:
  - beck, if you have any better ideas, you tell me now.

- que:
  - will you take my gloves off?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - where's zimsky?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - what could you do if i got you enough power to fire the impeller?
  ans:
  - maybe not the laser but the impeller.

- que:
  - from where?
  ans:
  - the heat of the core.

- que:
  - come on, beck, where is it?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - ls that the last one?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - let's just pray we don't run into any dead ends, or we're going to miss those lasers.
  ans:
  - so, rat, what's the center of this quake?

- que:
  - okay, navigator, which way?
  ans:
  - we've got greater fluid density on the left.

- que:
  - bill, where are they headed?
  ans:
  - looks like she found a space between some tectonic plates somewhere near hawaii.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - they're closing in on us too fast.

- que:
  - where'd our power go?
  ans:
  - well, we're powered by the heat.

- que:
  - you always look on the bright side?
  ans:
  - always.

- que:
  - where do they think?
  ans:
  - bill, put it up on the hydrophone.

- que:
  - orbital wobble?
  ans:
  - yeah, that's what they call it.

- que:
  - do you ever get tired of being right?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so what's next for you?
  ans:
  - a shower.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - deep dish pepperoni pizza, green peppers, onions, extra mushrooms then a shower and then back to the classroom.

- que:
  - you know what makes me really, really angry?
  ans:
  - destiny, meet world.

- que:
  - okay, guys, connect the oxygen.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - braz, you got that?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - bob?
  ans:
  - you're going to be weak.

- que:
  - i'm going to check your heartbeat, okay?
  ans:
  - thanks, braz.

  - juno, that's right, isn't it?
  ans:
  - check the book.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no point.

- que:
  - you filed a flight plan to mountain rescue?
  ans:
  - lf we don't report in, they'll come looking for us.

- que:
  - we're in the wrong fucking cave?
  ans:
  - holly was right.

- que:
  - we said, if there's no risk, what's the point?
  ans:
  - don't try and justify this.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - there may not be a way out.

- que:
  - what the fuck do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - we all trusted you.

- que:
  - have you any idea what she's been through?
  ans:
  - no, cos you couldn't get away fast enough, you selfish cow.

- que:
  - you know what, beth?
  ans:
  - don't move, sam.

- que:
  - so, what now?
  ans:
  - one of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - we lost it, when the cave collapsed.

- que:
  - what are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - fuck.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - it's nothing.

- que:
  - was this about me or you?
  ans:
  - it's about us, getting back to what we used to be.

- que:
  - juno?
  ans:
  - we'll need everything we've got.

- que:
  - what does it mean?
  ans:
  - it means we're not the first.

- que:
  - it's a piton, right?
  ans:
  - lf cavers were here, there's a better chance of us getting out.

- que:
  - becca, are you ok?
  ans:
  - i'll live.

- que:
  - holly, how does it look?
  ans:
  - lt's tight again, but i can get through.

  - you've got the mountain, the cave... and there's two entrances.

- que:
  - this means there's another way out?
  ans:
  - holly, give me your lighter.

- que:
  - what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - i need to dress the wound and rig up a splint, but i can't while the bone is protruding.

- que:
  - do you think i'm worth it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - ecstacy.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - a burn.

- que:
  - how did it happen?
  ans:
  - when i was a kid, my dad was drunk and he dropped a cigarette on my nightgown and it caught fire.

- que:
  - elwood, what the hell are we doing?
  ans:
  - target practice.

- que:
  - you wanna do the confidence course a few times to get you back into shape?
  ans:
  - no, thanks, top.

- que:
  - oh, you want some meatloaf, saad?
  ans:
  - that's a fucking insult to me.

- que:
  - are you trying to make some point here, saad?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what do you mean, it was empty?
  ans:
  - empty.

- que:
  - you looked inside the battery, right?
  ans:
  - like always.

  ans:
  - isn't that so, marshall?

- que:
  - he was involved in some disastrous battle and lost a leg, didn't he?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't say it was disastrous.

- que:
  - he lost an arm as well, didn't he?
  ans:
  - no, he didn't lose an arm.

- que:
  - drink, general?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i don't go much for this lineage shit.

- que:

  ans:
  - right away, sir.

- que:
  - how's it going?
  ans:
  - oh, the usual.

  - that's real nice, man.

- que:
  - ain't you sick of being fucked by a white man?
  ans:
  - uh oh, customers.

- que:
  - hey, you wanna know something?
  ans:
  - you ain't like elwood here.

- que:
  - he murdered your car?
  ans:
  - yeah, shot to pieces.

- que:
  - why would he do that?
  ans:
  - that's pretty extreme, even for him.

- que:
  - are you into some kind of shit on the side?
  ans:
  - i've lived on base my whole life.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - aren't you?
  ans:
  - a fiasco.

- que:
  - a debacle even, wouldn't you say?
  ans:
  - goddamn it, it was your idea.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - leave it to me.

- que:
  - when you say fuck me up, what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i mean, fuck you right up.

- que:
  - are you saying he's gonna kill me?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but...

- que:
  - why are you telling me all this?
  ans:
  - i guess i don't want him to fuck you up.

- que:
  - general?
  ans:
  - there's something i'd like to talk to you about.

- que:
  - er, what do you have in mind?
  ans:
  - well, with all this activity in the east, i thought we should stay on our toes.

- que:
  - do you really think you're up for this sort of thing?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, sir.

- que:
  - you want to defend the nuke base against marshall's infantry?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - wallace, can i see you in the kitchen?
  ans:
  - just a moment, honey.

- que:
  - er, marshall, what do you think?
  ans:
  - er... sounds good to me.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - you're bored.

- que:
  - do you ever have falling dreams?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - is that the same as yours?
  ans:
  - kind of.

- que:
  - well, why, what happens in yours?
  ans:
  - i wake up before i hit the ground.

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - some strange shit's been going down.

- que:
  - what's he been saying?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - but you've killed people before in war and stuff, right?
  ans:
  - and now you wanna kill ray elwood.

- que:
  - it's no different, is it?
  ans:
  - i really don't think you know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - who the fuck did that to you?
  ans:
  - fuckers.

- que:
  - just let me clean it up, all right?
  ans:
  - i've got some stuff here.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - it'll calm you down.

- que:
  - i'll get you a beer, yeah?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - it fucks with your head, and... sometimes you don't know who to trust, you know?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - don't you think?
  ans:
  - a stunning success.

- que:
  - hm?
  ans:
  - well, honey, it's been a while.

- que:
  - why, in your opinion, was it a good idea to challenge marshall to a training exercise when you're supply and he's infantry?
  ans:
  - you told me i should go on the attack.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - the deal's off, sir.

- que:
  - what do you mean, it's off?
  ans:
  - there's just some bad shit happening right now and i can't do it.

- que:
  - a bit of fun?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - they killed your friend, huh?
  ans:
  - some fucking russians killed my son.

- que:
  - you talk to me about your friend?
  ans:
  - i don't give a fuck about your friend.

- que:
  - how did it go?
  ans:
  - great.

- que:
  - how the fuck are we supposed to get the guns out of the nuke base with this training exercise?
  ans:
  - if berman's exercise lasts all weekend, there's no way we're gonna get the guns out.

- que:
  - how the fuck are you gonna take care of it?
  ans:
  - i said i'll fucking take care of it.

- que:
  - what you looking at, son?
  ans:
  - you better get on out of here.

- que:
  - you're a real bad motherfucker, ain't you?
  ans:
  - take him to the shed.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - a little investment advice.

- que:
  - how much you think you'll make on that shipment?
  ans:
  - it'll tide me over.

- que:
  - well, do you know what security on that'll be?
  ans:
  - well, i guess you're here to give me a price quote.

- que:
  - you wanna talk business, right?
  ans:
  - so let's talk business.

- que:
  - what the fuck are you talking about, a cut?
  ans:
  - i'm your brand new fucking partner.

- que:
  - they hurt you again?
  ans:
  - no, i just kind of got a sore elbow.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - the thing about cooking smack is, to not get fucked up by the fumes, you gotta have a full stomach.

- que:
  - catch my drift here, right?
  ans:
  - saad doesn't eat meat.

- que:
  - line up.
  ans:
  - why the hell did they go over there?

- que:
  - did i ever tell you i met president kennedy?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you know what general lancaster called me?
  ans:
  - incompetent.

- que:
  - will he include that in your efficiency report, sir?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - you know what i'm gonna do, elwood?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna take my pension and buy that vineyard.

- que:
  - that doesn't sound like such a bad idea, does it?
  ans:
  - make sure and give the turk all my love.

- que:
  - hey, you feel bad about berman?
  ans:
  - oh, fuck, no.

- que:
  - you don't feel bad about tipping off marshall?
  ans:
  - i thought you liked berman.

- que:
  - couldn't find the base?
  ans:
  - you boys are looking tense.

- que:
  - so, how long does it take to cook this stuff?
  ans:
  - most of the night.

- que:
  - what the fuck is he doing here?
  ans:
  - he's with me.

- que:
  - got a problem with that?
  ans:
  - whoa, whoa, saad, do me a favour and put that out.

- que:
  - what happens if it goes below?
  ans:
  - if it goes below 80, the reaction stops, we gotta cook longer.

- que:
  - well, what?
  ans:
  - cooking smack is like preparing thanksgiving dinner where one ingredient is a hand grenade.

- que:
  - this shit explodes?
  ans:
  - kaboom.

- que:
  - you on it?
  ans:
  - i'm on it, man.

- que:
  - saad, do you want a hotdog?
  ans:
  - i don't want no fucking hotdog.

- que:
  - you got no vegetarian shit?
  ans:
  - hotdogs are made up of lips, udders and assholes.

- que:
  - can we just eat our hotdogs and chill out?
  ans:
  - not you, of course, saad.

- que:
  - what are you worried about?
  ans:
  - just kick back, watch some tv, educate yourself.

- que:
  - robyn?
  ans:
  - come on up.

- que:
  - are you scared?
  ans:
  - of course i'm not scared.

- que:
  - what would it take to make you jump?
  ans:
  - a parachute.

- que:
  - why are you putting your arms up like that?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - why do you motherfuckers eat so damn much?
  ans:
  - because we're growing lads.

- que:
  - shit, what time is it?
  ans:
  - it's midnight.

- que:
  - where you going?
  ans:
  - fuck.

- que:
  - can i come?
  ans:
  - they're in there.

- que:
  - where is the berlin wall?
  ans:
  - it's in berlin, you dumb fuck.

- que:
  - what country is it in?
  ans:
  - it's in germany, man.

- que:
  - are we in west germany or are we in east germany?
  ans:
  - we're in east.

- que:
  - what's the difference?
  ans:
  - fucked if i know, man.

- que:
  - what are you doing with robyn?
  ans:
  - captain kimborough, come in.

- que:
  - so, you've been putting it to my daughter and you think that's making war?
  ans:
  - war, you dumb fuck, is playing for keeps.

- que:
  - well, who do you think took out stoney?
  ans:
  - you are fucking stupid.

- que:
  - can you wait one second?
  ans:
  - listen to me.

- que:
  - what's he doing?
  ans:
  - he's taking him to the stockade.

- que:
  - you wanna hear the secret of vietnam?
  ans:
  - the secret of vietnam's simple.

- que:
  - what are you doing here, sir?
  ans:
  - get away from the window.

- que:
  - you got the balls to do something like that?
  ans:
  - boiling point.

- que:
  - no, what is it?
  ans:
  - defence superior service medal, sir.

- que:
  - they think it was a gas explosion?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - and this er, robert lee, the sergeant that got the posthumous silver star, you knew him well, did you?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - is that right?
  ans:
  - i didn't know that.

- que:
  - how's she doing?
  ans:
  - she's doing ok, sir.

- que:
  - are you sure you're ok standing?
  ans:
  - if the leg starts getting weary, you just cop a squat.

- que:
  - so, you like it here in hawaii?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - now, see what have we got here?
  ans:
  - oh, just some requisitions, sir.

- que:
  - do we really need that much?
  ans:
  - well, cleanliness is next to godliness.

- que:
  - can i look out?
  ans:
  - no, they might shoot us.

- que:
  - then the war is over?
  ans:
  - soon.

- que:
  - but what is that noise?
  ans:
  - panic.

- que:
  - air power, field marshal?
  ans:
  - briefly, please.

- que:
  - ammunition?
  ans:
  - also minimal.

- que:
  - replacements?
  ans:
  - minimal.

- que:
  - morale?
  ans:
  - nonexistent.

- que:
  - what do you think we should do?
  ans:
  - end the war, you fools.

- que:
  - why in the world are you laughing?
  ans:
  - excuse us.

- que:
  - anything at all on when they plan to invade holland?
  ans:
  - they seem to have paused in belgium.

- que:
  - how many vehicles in the past hour?
  ans:
  - fifty four.

- que:
  - and for the same hour yesterday?
  ans:
  - ninety eight.

- que:
  - but when?
  ans:
  - i've just got back to england from brussels... where i had a meeting this morning with field marshal montgomery.

- que:
  - where's this all going to take place?
  ans:
  - holland.

- que:
  - and when?
  ans:
  - i'm coming to that now.

- que:
  - for how long?
  ans:
  - monty assures me that 30 corps... will do the 63 miles in two days.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - the sooner we go, the better.

- que:
  - is something troubling you, general sosabowski?
  ans:
  - i've said nothing.

- que:
  - but you do disapprove?
  ans:
  - patton.

- que:
  - arnhem?
  ans:
  - arnhem.

- que:
  - why the emergency meeting?
  ans:
  - keeping abreast of the little changes.

- que:
  - how big are the little changes?
  ans:
  - i'll answer you with typical british understatement:gigantic.

- que:
  - how about us?
  ans:
  - we'll be all right.

- que:
  - has it ever been tried before?
  ans:
  - not in a major drop.

- que:
  - think there might be a reason for that?
  ans:
  - let's hope not.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - it'll be all right.

- que:
  - is there anything else?
  ans:
  - well, you're my dutch advisor, harry.

- que:
  - i forgot to tell you something?
  ans:
  - only that the germans first tried to take nijmegen bridge themselves... back in 1940, and got slaughtered.

- que:
  - are you sure about the colors?
  ans:
  - i'm sure, father.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - the british will have an explanation.

- que:
  - did you pass on the message about the tanks?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - yes, fuller?
  ans:
  - we've got some information on tanks.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - dutch underground reports from the arnhem area.

- que:
  - have they been identified?
  ans:
  - not by our intelligence, sir.

- que:
  - so it's the same rumors as before, right?
  ans:
  - i believe these rumors, sir.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - the general consensus of opinion is that our opposition... will consist entirely of hitler youth or old men on bicycles.

- que:
  - what's the terrain like?
  ans:
  - sorry, sir.

- que:
  - what about there?
  ans:
  - afraid not, sir.

- que:
  - presumably you're intending to let us land somewhere?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - where the hell is it?
  ans:
  - well, it's not actually on this photograph.

- que:
  - yes, sir?
  ans:
  - just making sure whose side you're on.

- que:
  - and they'll be quick enough to secure both ends of arnhem bridge?
  ans:
  - now look here.

- que:
  - do you understand?
  ans:
  - you ought to have more faith in montgomery's intelligence reports.

- que:
  - do you wish such a letter?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - you don't believe me, sir?
  ans:
  - clearly not.

- que:
  - but what then?
  ans:
  - i just don't believe these damn radios are strong enough... to carry the eight miles from the drop zone to arnhem bridge.

- que:
  - don't happen to have any cigarettes, do you, sir?
  ans:
  - they're perfectly okay.

- que:
  - any biscuits?
  ans:
  - your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

- que:
  - shouldn't you tell the general if you're so certain about it, sir?
  ans:
  - if i were, believe me, i would.

- que:
  - what difference will it make?
  ans:
  - the general will be on the bridge himself by nightfall.

- que:
  - he won't have to make contact with the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?
  ans:
  - well, if anyone rocks the boat... it's not gonna be me.

- que:
  - but, sir... if they weren't serviceable, why would they try to conceal them?
  ans:
  - normal routine, fuller.

- que:
  - how many of them have shown tanks?
  ans:
  - just these, sir.

- que:
  - and you seriously consider asking us to cancel... the biggest operation mounted since d day... because of three photographs?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - is that fully understood?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - what do you say to that, joe?
  ans:
  - delighted, sir.

- que:
  - do you want me to pack that as well, sir?
  ans:
  - no, thank you, wicks.

- que:
  - you haven't forgotten my golf clubs, have you?
  ans:
  - well, let's hope so.

- que:
  - why don't you quit that?
  ans:
  - chock full of vitamins.

- que:
  - hey, where'd you put that?
  ans:
  - damn it, eddie, give it back.

- que:
  - and what can guarantee that?
  ans:
  - you will.

- que:
  - i will what?
  ans:
  - you tell me, eddie.

- que:
  - hey, eddie, were you kidding?
  ans:
  - major fuller.

- que:
  - mind a bit of company?
  ans:
  - of course not, sir.

- que:
  - who isn't?
  ans:
  - we've been getting reports from a number of your friends.

- que:
  - is it because i rocked the boat?
  ans:
  - i'm a doctor.

- que:
  - but why?
  ans:
  - i'm not ill or anything.

- que:
  - can't it be stopped?
  ans:
  - i don't want to be left behind, please.

- que:
  - how do you feel?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - i told you i had never jumped, but thought i ought to give it a go?
  ans:
  - well, you did me a big favor.

- que:
  - what was the favor?
  ans:
  - well, i didn't quite tell you everything at the time... but i'm prone to airsickness.

- que:
  - soon be home, harry.
  ans:
  - what, every flight?

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - easier than walking, sir.

- que:
  - your sleeping beauties know there's a war on, do they?
  ans:
  - absolutely, sir.

- que:
  - is it true that the germans have put more troops into the line ahead of us?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - right you are, joe.
  ans:
  - including me?

- que:
  - any last minute changes, bob?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - think you'll be able to manage it?
  ans:
  - i've got nothing else planned for this afternoon.

- que:
  - what the hell's that?
  ans:
  - it's flak.

- que:
  - fantastic, isn't it?
  ans:
  - just once to have such power in my hands.

- que:
  - british paratroopers have landed... three kilometers from here.
  ans:
  - where the hell do you think you're going?

- que:
  - why should they do that?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - a strong force has landed south of nijmegen.
  ans:
  - you okay?

- que:
  - nijmegen?
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - don't be silly.

- que:
  - where'd you ever get that idea?
  ans:
  - but you like him.

- que:
  - you don't like him like daddy?
  ans:
  - regan, i love your daddy.

- que:
  - what did you hear?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - because burke and i are just friends.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - really.

- que:
  - are you ready for sleep?
  ans:
  - good night, honey.

- que:
  - am i really?
  ans:
  - it's more than psychiatry, and you know that.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - no rats.

- que:
  - the edema affected her brain, you understand?
  ans:
  - she don't let no doctor go near her.

- que:
  - do you have an appointment?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - are you a relative?
  ans:
  - i am her brother.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - mama, i'm going to take you out of here.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - there seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink.

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - never seen it before in my life.

- que:
  - have you?
  ans:
  - we're pretty comfortable up there...... compared to the gemini and mercury programs, which were tight for space.

- que:
  - yes, of course.
  ans:
  - lf you ever go up there again, will you take me along?

- que:
  - over behind the church.
  ans:
  - and you never went bowling with goebbels either, i suppose, huh?

- que:
  - you know where i mean?
  ans:
  - it's a red brick wing.

- que:
  - who's the priest i keep seeing there?
  ans:
  - he's always there.

- que:
  - who's that?
  ans:
  - burke, your car's at the curb.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - fuck it.

- que:
  - honey, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, she's been sick.

- que:
  - what's wrong with me?
  ans:
  - it's just like the doctor said.

- que:
  - ls it coming out, willie?
  ans:
  - that's an insult.

- que:
  - where'd you get it, then?
  ans:
  - i stole it.

- que:
  - now you think you can sleep?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you going to steal my shoes now?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - a convulsion?
  ans:
  - the shaking of the bed.

- que:
  - what causes this?
  ans:
  - a lesion in the temporal lobe.

- que:
  - it is?
  ans:
  - it can last for days, even weeks.

- que:
  - do me a favor, will you?
  ans:
  - tell me something good.

- que:
  - regan, can you sit up and scoot over here?
  ans:
  - watch the l. v.

- que:
  - i'm just going to move you down on the table, okay?
  ans:
  - just for a short time.

- que:
  - do you want me to run another series?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - have you got some time?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - dr. klein?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm dr. klein.

- que:
  - ls she having spasms again?
  ans:
  - yes, but they're violent.

- que:
  - you gave her the medication?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - thorazine.

- que:
  - how could she fly off the bed like that?
  ans:
  - pathological states can induce abnormal strength...... accelerated motor performance.

- que:
  - now, i know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry...... but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
  ans:
  - so what's wrong with her?

- que:
  - so, what's next?
  ans:
  - a pneumoencephalogram, i would think, to pin down that lesion.

- que:
  - do you keep any drugs in your house?
  ans:
  - no, of course not.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - of course, i'm sure.

- que:
  - are you planning to be home soon?
  ans:
  - i mean to la.

- que:
  - why do you ask?
  ans:
  - i think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.

- que:
  - what's burke got to do with it?
  ans:
  - we have to start looking for a shrink.

- que:
  - heard what?
  ans:
  - you haven't heard.

- que:
  - are you comfortable, regan?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how old are you?
  ans:
  - twelve.

- que:
  - ls there someone inside you?
  ans:
  - sometimes.

- que:
  - who is it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - ls it captain howdy?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - lf i ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid.

- que:
  - do you want him to leave you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have we met?
  ans:
  - no, we haven't met, but they said i could tell.

- que:
  - what's this all about?
  ans:
  - it's true.

- que:
  - do people say you look like paul newman?
  ans:
  - always.

- que:
  - you know this director who was doing a film here, burke dennings?
  ans:
  - i've seen him.

- que:
  - you're also familiar how last week he died?
  ans:
  - only what i read in the papers.

- que:
  - father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?
  ans:
  - from the witching end, not the hunting.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - from the psychiatric end.

- que:
  - all of this desecration in the church...... does this have anything to do with witchcraft?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - you read how he died?
  ans:
  - ln a fall.

- que:
  - that didn't happen in the fall?
  ans:
  - it's possible.

- que:
  - you think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
  ans:
  - maybe somebody crazy, somebody with...... a spite against the church.

- que:
  - a sick priest, is that it?
  ans:
  - look, father, this is hard for you.

- que:
  - doctor's ethics. lf you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?
  ans:
  - no, i probably wouldn't.

- que:
  - ls that a threat?
  ans:
  - very much.

- que:
  - who's in it?
  ans:
  - groucho marx.

- que:
  - are you happy?
  ans:
  - i've seen it.

- que:
  - all right.
  ans:
  - can you think of some priest who fits the bill?

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the dominicans.

- que:
  - i could have you deported, you know that?
  ans:
  - i lied.

- que:
  - you're sorry?
  ans:
  - jesus christ, 88 doctors...... and all you can tell me, with all your bullshit is....

- que:
  - do you have any religious beliefs?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what about your daughter?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - have you ever heard of exorcism?
  ans:
  - well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...... rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so called invading spirit.

- que:
  - she's going to be well?
  ans:
  - karl, if you put this in regan's bedroom, i want you to tell me.

- que:
  - now, did you?
  ans:
  - no, not me.

- que:
  - did you put it there?
  ans:
  - of course, i didn't.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - a man to see you.

- que:
  - might she remember?
  ans:
  - no, she was heavily sedated.

- que:
  - it's serious?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm afraid it is.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - no, karl, we're fine.

- que:
  - why are you asking all this?
  ans:
  - it's strange.

- que:
  - but nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?
  ans:
  - it could be one way.

- que:
  - they have visitors?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - you were expecting a package that day, some delivery?
  ans:
  - none that i know of.

- que:
  - groceries, cleaning... a package?
  ans:
  - i really wouldn't know.

- que:
  - would you like to ask him?
  ans:
  - no, never mind, it's...... it's very remote.

- que:
  - would you like some more coffee?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - your daughter, she's the artist?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - correct?
  ans:
  - when she's better, i'll ask her.

- que:
  - i really hate to ask you this, but...... for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - where's a pencil?
  ans:
  - i lied.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - please go away.

- que:
  - have you got a cigarette, father?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - how did a shrink ever get to be a priest?
  ans:
  - it's the other way around.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - harvard, bellevue...... johns hopkins.

- que:
  - you're a friend of father dyer's, right?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - pretty close?
  ans:
  - pretty close.

- que:
  - did he talk to you about my party?
  ans:
  - he sure did.

- que:
  - about my daughter?
  ans:
  - no, i didn't know you had one.

- que:
  - he didn't mention her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - he didn't tell you what she did?
  ans:
  - he didn't mention her.

- que:
  - priests are pretty tight mouthed, then, huh?
  ans:
  - that depends.

- que:
  - on what?
  ans:
  - the priest.

- que:
  - would you have to turn them in?
  ans:
  - well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, i'd say no.

- que:
  - you wouldn't?
  ans:
  - no, i wouldn't.

- que:
  - lf a person is, you know, possessed by a demon, or something...... how do they get an exorcism?
  ans:
  - first, i'd have to get them into a time machine...... and get them back to the 16th century.

- que:
  - since when?
  ans:
  - since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia...... those things they taught me at harvard.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - the church, before it approves an exorcism...... conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted.

- que:
  - could you see her?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - lf you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
  ans:
  - that's much too vulgar a display ofpower, karras.

- que:
  - where's regan?
  ans:
  - in here, with us.

- que:
  - could you help an old altar boy, father?
  ans:
  - your mother is in here with us, karras.

- que:
  - would you like to leave a message?
  ans:
  - i'll see that she gets it.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - her speaking in a language she's never known or studied.

- que:
  - what else?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you know my mother died recently?
  ans:
  - yes, i did.

- que:
  - ls regan aware of it?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - why do you ask?
  ans:
  - it's not important.

- que:
  - you'd like that?
  ans:
  - intensely.

- que:
  - but wouldn't that drive you out of regan?
  ans:
  - it would bring us together.

- que:
  - you and regan?
  ans:
  - you and us.

- que:
  - did you do that?
  ans:
  - do it again.

- que:
  - you speak latin?
  ans:
  - ego te absolvo.

- que:
  - quod nomen mihi est?
  ans:
  - la plume de ma tante.

- que:
  - how long are you planning to stay in regan?

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what about your daughter?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - have you ever heard of exorcism?
  ans:
  - well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...... rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so called invading spirit.

- que:
  - she's going to be well?
  ans:
  - karl, if you put this in regan's bedroom, i want you to tell me.

- que:
  - now, did you?
  ans:
  - no, not me.

- que:
  - did you put it there?
  ans:
  - of course, i didn't.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - a man to see you.

- que:
  - what man?
  ans:
  - you're a very nice lady.

- que:
  - it's serious?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm afraid it is.

- que:
  - may i ask...?
  ans:
  - we still don't know.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - no, karl, we're fine.

- que:
  - why are you asking all this?
  ans:
  - it's strange.

- que:
  - but nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?
  ans:
  - it could be one way.

- que:
  - they have visitors?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - you were expecting a package that day, some delivery?
  ans:
  - not that i know of.

- que:
  - groceries, cleaning... a package?
  ans:
  - i really wouldn't know.

- que:
  - would you like to ask him?
  ans:
  - no, never mind, it's...... it's very remote.

- que:
  - would you like some more coffee?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - your daughter, she's the artist?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - correct?
  ans:
  - when she's better, i'll ask her.

- que:
  - i really hate to ask you this, but...... for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - where's a pencil?
  ans:
  - i lied.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - please go away.

- que:
  - have you got a cigarette, father?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - how did a shrink ever get to be a priest?
  ans:
  - it's the other way around.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - harvard, bellevue...... johns hopkins.

- que:
  - you're a friend of father dyer's, right?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - pretty close?
  ans:
  - pretty close.

- que:
  - did he talk to you about my party?
  ans:
  - he sure did.

- que:
  - about my daughter?
  ans:
  - no, i didn't know you had one.

- que:
  - he didn't mention her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - he didn't tell you what she did?
  ans:
  - he didn't mention her.

- que:
  - priests are pretty tight mouthed then?
  ans:
  - that depends.

- que:
  - on what?
  ans:
  - the priest.

- que:
  - would you have to turn them in?
  ans:
  - well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, i'd say no.

- que:
  - you wouldn't?
  ans:
  - no, i wouldn't.

- que:
  - if a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something...... how do they get an exorcism?
  ans:
  - first, i'd have to get them into a time machine...... and get them back to the 1 6th century.

- que:
  - since when?
  ans:
  - since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - secondly, the church, before it approves an exorcism...... conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted.

- que:
  - could you see her?
  ans:
  - yes, i could.

- que:
  - if you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
  ans:
  - that's much too vulgar a display of power, karras.

- que:
  - where's regan?
  ans:
  - in here, with us.

- que:
  - could you help an old altar boy, father?
  ans:
  - your mother is in here with us, karras.

- que:
  - would you like to leave a message?
  ans:
  - i il see that she gets it.

- que:
  - hello, daddy?
  ans:
  - this is me.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - her speaking in a language she's never known or studied.

- que:
  - what else?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you know my mother died recently?
  ans:
  - yes, i did.

- que:
  - is regan aware of it?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - why do you ask?
  ans:
  - it's not important.

- que:
  - what should i say anyway?
  ans:
  - just talk to your daddy.

- que:
  - can you hear me okay?
  ans:
  - he's not going to answer you.

- que:
  - you'd like that?
  ans:
  - intensely.

- que:
  - but wouldn't that drive you out of regan?
  ans:
  - it would bring us together.

- que:
  - you and regan?
  ans:
  - you and us.

- que:
  - did you do that?
  ans:
  - do it again.

- que:
  - you speak latin?
  ans:
  - ego te absolvo.

- que:
  - quod nomen mihi est?
  ans:
  - la plume de ma tante.

- que:
  - how long are you planning to stay in regan?
  ans:
  - until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - no one.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - she's, she's all right.

- que:
  - i don't want to talk about it, okay?
  ans:
  - okay, i'll talk to you.

- que:
  - i'll call as soon as it's over, all right?
  ans:
  - no, i just, i'm going through something and i just have to....

  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - what do you drink?
  ans:
  - scotch.

  - where's her father?
  ans:
  - in europe.

- que:
  - have you told him what's happening?
  ans:
  - no.

  - what's the difference?
  ans:
  - holy water is blessed.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - she killed burke dennings.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i'll be right there.

- que:
  - you're convinced that it's genuine?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you would want to do the exorcism yourself?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how about lankester merrin?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - are you very tired?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - would you like some brandy in that, father?
  ans:
  - the doctors say i shouldn't.

- que:
  - what is your daughter's middle name, mrs. macneil?
  ans:
  - it doesn't make sense.

- que:
  - are you tired?
  ans:
  - let's rest before we start again.

- que:
  - dimmy, why do you do this to me?
  ans:
  - her heart.

- que:

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i just wanted to talk.

- que:
  - do they make any sense?
  ans:
  - it all seems so massive and so random.

- que:
  - have you ever been to a rememory?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - whose?
  ans:
  - my ex boyfriend.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because it just wasn't...

- que:
  - what about all the bits in between?
  ans:
  - it's a miniature.

- que:
  - how do you do this?
  ans:
  - it's what i was meant to do.

- que:
  - do you recall any moments with your daughter?
  ans:
  - this isn't long ago.

- que:
  - is that necessary?
  ans:
  - there's nothing that any one of you can tell me... that i won't know very soon.

  ans:
  - that's him.

- que:
  - caroline, are you all right?
  ans:
  - you did very well.

- que:
  - what's his name?

  - not anymore.

- que:
  - what did you want to be, then?
  ans:
  - a doctor.

- que:
  - a doctor, eh?
  ans:
  - clever kid.

- que:
  - why a doctor?
  ans:
  - because i want to help people when they're hurt.

- que:
  - would you listen to this little kid?
  ans:
  - you got a good heart, danny.

- que:
  - it's a strange profession you have, isn't it, alan?
  ans:
  - you take people's lives, make lies out of them.

- que:
  - how can you handle it, alan?
  ans:
  - people sleeping and shitting... people stealing from each other... manipulating each other... the obscenity.

- que:
  - what could i possibly have that you want?
  ans:
  - i know you've taken the bannister project... and i want it.

- que:
  - would you forget the damn code and grow up?
  ans:

- que:
  - hey, did you change the color of our fishing boat?
  ans:
  - i would never do that.

  - because i remember it being green, not red.

- que:
  - will you excuse me?
  ans:
  - i have to go.

- que:
  - are you sure that's what happened?
  ans:
  - some of us still live by the code, fletcher.

- que:
  - guilt?
  ans:
  - no, i don't have any of those... not as much as you do.

- que:
  - that part with the partners.
  ans:
  - when his son had the mumps?

- que:
  - could you believe that?
  ans:
  - it's the rememory your husband deserved, caroline.

- que:
  - why are they tattooed like that?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - they're so grotesque, aren't they?
  ans:
  - sorry about your loss.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i love it.

- que:
  - is it keys?
  ans:

  - no, thank you.

- que:
  - so, what's your name?
  ans:
  - louis.

- que:
  - yours?
  ans:
  - alan.

- que:
  - that's what you're talking to me about, alan?
  ans:
  - well, more than that.

- que:
  - why do you need me?
  ans:
  - there's no place for me with you.

- que:
  - alan?
  ans:
  - alan.

- que:
  - this?
  ans:
  - rather not elaborate.

- que:
  - how can you make a decision like that?
  ans:
  - whittling a life down to one...

- que:
  - michael, honey, would you run down to the store... and buy us some cigarettes?
  ans:
  - we've got eight packs already.

- que:
  - now... are you all right?
  ans:
  - i saw fletcher yesterday.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what happened to him after he quit?
  ans:
  - he seems changed.

- que:
  - think he could be involved with anti implant groups?
  ans:
  - i've heard rumors... talk of them being organized by an ex cutter.

- que:
  - who is this person?
  ans:
  - just someone from my childhood.

- que:
  - so... how is it that you and i know each other again?
  ans:
  - we don't.

- que:
  - billy who?
  ans:
  - don't play games.

- que:
  - how do you know my name?
  ans:
  - i know that you suffocated those kittens when you were 13.

- que:
  - they say that friends help you move... but good friends help you move bodies, don't they?
  ans:
  - i just want what billy wanted.

- que:
  - please go, ok?
  ans:
  - just go.

- que:
  - is this why you wanted to meet me here?
  ans:
  - i thought it would be safer this way.

- que:
  - how's thelma doing?
  ans:
  - i can't give you bannister, and you know i can't.

- que:
  - will he remember the special moments between them... or moments someone like you decides are special?
  ans:
  - my job is to help people remember... what they want to remember, fletcher.

- que:
  - the right not to pop up in some guy's rememory... without even knowing you were being filmed?
  ans:
  - i didn't invent the technology.

- que:
  - so you want to destroy eye tech with a scandal?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - is this about your sister?
  ans:
  - don't even say her name.

- que:
  - why is your name the first on the list... for cutting scumbags and lowlifes?
  ans:
  - because i forgive people long after... they could be punished for their sins.

- que:
  - do you know what a sin eater is?
  ans:
  - it's part of an ancient tradition.

- que:
  - are you worried about my soul, fletcher?
  ans:
  - i will have bannister.

- que:
  - you see that man behind me?
  ans:
  - goodness.

- que:
  - the pier?
  ans:
  - yes, the pier.

- que:
  - this was during college?
  ans:
  - yes, i was in college... and i remember, i looked up at him... and i thought, this is the man...

- que:
  - a man?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - mr. hakman, how is this relevant?
  ans:
  - minor people i don't even know have no place in the rememory.

- que:
  - right now?
  ans:
  - it would be very helpful.

- que:
  - remember what i told you?
  ans:
  - mr. hakman wants to talk to you about daddy.

- que:
  - mrs. bannister?
  ans:
  - we have a problem with the caterers.

- que:
  - what's going on in there?
  ans:
  - birthday party for mr. froggy.

- que:
  - do you think mr. froggy would mind... if i took you away from the party for a minute?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - who's that in your arms?
  ans:
  - my doll.

- que:
  - what's her name?
  ans:
  - she doesn't have a name.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - isabel, your daddy...

- que:
  - can i ask one question?
  ans:
  - and then i'm gone.

- que:
  - was his name louis hunt?
  ans:
  - he was my teacher.

- que:
  - what does he teach?
  ans:
  - he doesn't teach anymore.

- que:
  - did you have a rememory, like for your father?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are you gonna fix what my daddy can remember?
  ans:
  - in a way... yes.

- que:
  - can you make him forget that i... that i drew on his contract with crayon?
  ans:
  - i will.

- que:
  - will he forget that?
  ans:
  - he'll forget.

- que:
  - there's nobody following us, all right?
  ans:
  - this is a really big favor i'm doing for you.

- que:
  - so, what's this guy's name?
  ans:
  - louis hunt.

- que:
  - would i get you in trouble?
  ans:
  - they can track anyone accessing data from a computer, so this is the best i can do.

- que:
  - how do i use this?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - immortality.

- que:
  - when is the right time to tell your child... about their miraculous gift?
  ans:
  - congratulations.

- que:
  - do they make any sense?
  ans:
  - it all seems so massive and so random.

- que:
  - what happened to you?
  ans:
  - i saw something.

- que:
  - what have you got to eat in this dump?
  ans:
  - not much.

  ans:
  - so i can go solo.

- que:

  ans:
  - you're definitely broken up, right?

- que:
  - in front of an audience?
  ans:
  - i i i'm really not good in front of crowds.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - you don't have to ask.

  - you, lizzie mcguire, are actually presenting an award at the lmvas with paolo?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's a long story.

- que:
  - you're gonna get up onstage in front of all these people?
  ans:
  - that's the great thing.

- que:
  - for real?
  ans:
  - that's a lot to say about someone just knowing them a day.

- que:
  - it was that good, huh?
  ans:
  - you're such a good friend.

- que:
  - you want a little mano a mano?
  ans:
  - see, this is one of the reasons me and you aren't friends.

- que:
  - now, you actually think that i'm jealous of paolo?
  ans:
  - word.

- que:
  - you and i have trouble communicating?
  ans:
  - you're wrong, man.

- que:
  - why do we even pretend you're in charge?
  ans:
  - i could try, miss ungermeyer.

- que:
  - which is why i thought i'd bring you something to help ease the pain, hmm?
  ans:
  - i'd like one report on the rise and one on the decline.

- que:
  - you don't have a problem with that, do you?
  ans:
  - um, no.

- que:
  - why not take a crazy chance?
  ans:
  - wow.

- que:

  - so, i suppose you want me to keep quiet about this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  - when did you become an expert on ltalian award show thingies?
  ans:
  - it's called common sense, which i have a lot of to make up for my lack of the slow curve.

  - slow curve?
  ans:
  - forget it.

- que:
  - in fact, it may shock you.
  ans:

  - you haven't done anything wrong.

- que:
  - don't you usually just break and enter?

  - we were this close?
  ans:
  - uh huh.

- que:

  ans:
  - it'll be like it never happened.

- que:
  - you're citing case laws to support this insanity?
  ans:
  - we got married last night for goodness sake.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we can't be married and be opposing counselors.

- que:
  - can i say something?
  ans:
  - we'll look ridiculous.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - we'll be the laughing stock of the new york bar association because you will say something contrary just to be contrary.

- que:
  - you see what i mean?
  ans:
  - you just broke the little fella's leg right off.

- que:
  - well, why don't you just file here if that's what you want?
  ans:
  - oh, that's a great idea.

- que:
  - mother, what is this?
  ans:
  - oh, the girls and i are having a lip party later.

  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - sure, but i'm also your mother... when we're not in public.

- que:

  ans:
  - you haven't done anything wrong.

- que:

  - if you review your surveillance tape... you know, just how paranoid are you by the way?

  ans:
  - i don't like anything that puts a man on his knees.

- que:
  - without faith, without belief in something, what are we?
  ans:
  - to try and get past the woads in the north is insanity.

- que:
  - do you believe in this mission?

  ans:

- que:
  - where?
  ans:

- que:
  - why would they not attack?

  - hey, bors, do you intend to take vanora and all your little bastards back home?
  ans:
  - just gilly.

  ans:
  - who are you?

  - unhand me, defil...

- que:
  - ls this rome's quest or arthur's?
  ans:
  - arthur.

- que:
  - and what did you hear?
  ans:
  - fairy tales.

  - how many britons have you killed?
  ans:

- que:
  - why do you think i spared you in the forest?
  ans:
  - four.

- que:
  - what, that some men are born to be slaves?
  ans:
  - no, that isn't true.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - they killed pelagius a year past.

- que:
  - ls there any other way?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - but you're seven against 200?
  ans:
  - eight.

- que:
  - am i understood?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - he died in battle?
  ans:
  - it's a family tradition.

- que:
  - ls that the deed i am to be judged by?
  ans:
  - you stayed and fought when you didn't have to.

- que:
  - you did all that for no reason?
  ans:
  - these are your people.

- que:
  - what was it all for, if not for the reward of freedom?
  ans:
  - then do not do this.

  ans:
  - we train man animals who don't need breath gas...... to mine the gold for us.

- que:
  - education, huh?
  ans:
  - never engage in a criminal activity unless you have a patsy to pin it on...... in case you ever get found out.

- que:
  - but why do i have to be the patsy?
  ans:
  - so you don't get any bright ideas to get rid of terl...... and keep the gold for yourself.

- que:
  - over a man animal?
  ans:
  - man is a primitive species...... so we'll need something primitive for leverage.

- que:
  - how the crap should i know?
  ans:
  - there's no way of knowing that.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - food.

- que:
  - you, floyd?
  ans:
  - plenty to burn.

- que:
  - don't you know anything?

  - they know about the camera.

- que:
  - what are you thinking, jonnie?
  ans:
  - they made me do this before.

- que:
  - monsters?
  ans:
  - they're called psychlos.

- que:

  ans:
  - eight.

- que:
  - eight?
  ans:
  - eight.

- que:
  - the question is, how clever?
  ans:
  - hope is an admirable quality, but foolish isn't.

- que:
  - do you want lunch?
  ans:
  - it's obviously too much to ask a man animal...... to learn a language as sophisticated as psychlo.

- que:
  - what the hell for?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what if this one is particularly stupid?
  ans:
  - maybe we should train another one.

- que:
  - you can look at anything you want...... because there is nothing that will help you.
  ans:
  - how exactly do you plan to do that?

- que:
  - satisfied?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what about those we're leaving behind?
  ans:
  - there's nothing we can do.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - you can't defeat them.

- que:
  - you don't know her?
  ans:
  - someone knows how to speak the psychlo's language.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - she's stupid enough not to be a menace, pretty enough to be decorative.

- que:
  - don't you have some work to do?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - ker?
  ans:
  - all right, sir.

- que:

  ans:
  - we split them in half.

- que:
  - i'm gonna blow the dome?
  ans:
  - you're gonna blow the dome.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - thousands of gas drones and troops will be teleported here.

- que:
  - then what's the point?
  ans:
  - if they send more monsters to earth, we get wiped out.

- que:
  - their home planet?
  ans:
  - their home planet.

- que:
  - is everyone clear?
  ans:
  - count us in.

- que:
  - can you teach your men to fly this?
  ans:
  - i think i found one.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we don't have appendix a.

- que:
  - i thought you said nuclear fires were powerful?
  ans:
  - it's not nuclear.

- que:
  - will this be enough to blow up their whole planet?
  ans:
  - radiation reacts with their planet's atmosphere.

- que:
  - why is it in bars?
  ans:
  - i assumed, sir...... that a psychlo of your refinement wouldn't want raw ore.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - since you have had extra time...... to smelt it into bricks...... i'll expect the rest of the gold in seven days.

- que:
  - do you, ker?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i know the perfect way to celebrate.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - you can't shoot me.

- que:
  - how about giving your old teacher a clue as to who this might be?
  ans:
  - you insult yourself, sir.

- que:
  - how am i supposed to know who it is?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - greener?
  ans:
  - carlo.

  ans:
  - sure looks like it.

- que:

  ans:
  - both ears.

- que:
  - what've you got?

- que:
  - what else did reese say?
  ans:
  - i'm asking the questions here.

  - yes, azazel.

- que:
  - why does he focus in on me?
  ans:
  - you got his attention.

- que:
  - you mean like the book of the bible?

- que:
  - detective hobbes?
  ans:
  - i thought you quit.

- que:
  - you know what's going on?
  ans:
  - the police think that i did some bad things.

- que:
  - why do they think you did that?
  ans:
  - because....

- que:
  - he's not asleep, is he?
  ans:
  - no, son.

- que:
  - did it hurt?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - do you think he's gonna go to heaven?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - after the host body dies...... the demon can survive for one breath or 500 cubits, right?
  ans:
  - at the same time...... azazel says to me when he moves as spirit no man can resist.

- que:
  - will you take him somewhere...... nobody knows about?
  ans:
  - even me.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna go back to sleep...... and when i wake up everything is gonna be just the way it was.

- que:
  - you know what this means, right?
  ans:
  - i'm ready.

- que:
  - hey, jonesy, how're you doing?
  ans:
  - look, i'm worried, man.

- que:
  - be careful, okay?
  ans:
  - i'll see you, partner.

- que:
  - what am i doing?
  ans:
  - this is where things get a little tricky.

- que:
  - haven't you done enough?
  ans:
  - you made me kill an innocent man.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i didn't do any of that.

- que:
  - who'd you expect it'd be?
  ans:
  - now drop your gun, hobbes.

- que:
  - fuck you, huh?
  ans:
  - you're making me do this.

- que:
  - i don't know if i can do this.
  ans:
  - jonesy?

- que:
  - what the fuck you talking...?
  ans:
  - say hobbes disappears into the woods....

- que:
  - what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - if i kill you...... it's just the final...... pathetic chapter...... in the life of a disgraced hero.

- que:
  - can you guess...... what maximum fun is?
  ans:
  - sure you can.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - because i need more time.

- que:
  - time for what, asshole?
  ans:
  - five hundred cubits.

  - you think you're going to win?
  ans:
  - god willing.

  ans:
  - to die, the little chickenshit.

  ans:
  - oh, come on, azazel.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:

  ans:
  - we die together...... just you and me.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - the war isn't over, i promise you.

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:
  - i'm the only man ever to win the arctic flame three years running.

- que:
  - were you being coy, or is that some sick alaskan mind game?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - mr. thunder?
  ans:
  - look, maybe we started off on the wrong foot.

- que:
  - excuse me?

- que:
  - now, i'd met her a couple of times in town but we weren't what you'd call friends, you know?
  ans:
  - but cold weather brings people together in a strange way.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - to leave the country, alone.

- que:
  - who is darby shaw?
  ans:
  - that's a question for darby shaw.

- que:
  - speaking for many of our colleagues...... who are in a feeding frenzy to interview her...... where is darby shaw?
  ans:
  - that's also a question for darby shaw.

- que:
  - does that mean you don't know where she is?

  ans:
  - mr. president...

- que:
  - mr. voyles, does the fbi have any suspects?
  ans:
  - it's too soon.

- que:
  - are these killings in any way linked to the cla...... or to any other agency of the united states government?
  ans:
  - i'm shocked you'd think that.

- que:
  - bob, just look into it, okay?
  ans:
  - i suggest we meet back here at five.

- que:
  - but why kill him now, when he had so little time left?
  ans:
  - maybe they couldn't take a chance he'd last till the elections.

- que:
  - so why jensen?
  ans:
  - this president nominated him.

- que:
  - we're talking a conspiracy, then who are the conspirators?
  ans:
  - if we've let foreign terrorists in, there'll be hell to pay politically.

- que:
  - denton...... who are your suspects?
  ans:
  - this has to be kept very quiet.

- que:

  ans:
  - watch your claws.

- que:
  - did he say anything that might shed some light on these dreadful events?

- que:
  - how's that?
  ans:
  - it's all there in the brief.

- que:
  - it's amateur stuff...... but how often does something make coal sweat and run for cover?
  ans:
  - he didn't exactly sweat in front of us.

- que:
  - did he have any symptoms?
  ans:

- que:
  - why didn't i think of that?
  ans:
  - he hasn't decided whether to run again.

- que:

  ans:
  - probably, but i got to get this out... before i lose my train of thought.

  ans:
  - i don't.

- que:
  - is this against the rules?
  ans:
  - mmm.

  ans:
  - i wish.

- que:

  ans:
  - you can't reason with him.

- que:
  - all the same, i preferred to keep my bones unbroken.
  ans:
  - hello?

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - so you can eat me.

- que:
  - did you ever think that maybe you're not too big...... but maybe this town is just too small?
  ans:
  - i've heard in real cities there are buildings so tall...... you can't even see the tops of them.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - oh, i wouldn't lie to you.

- que:
  - now, you can eat a lot, can't you?

  - okay.

- que:
  - what'd she say?
  ans:
  - beats me.

- que:

  - what?
  ans:
  - i said, you're quite a catch.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - this town is more than any man could ask for.

- que:
  - how are you gonna make it without your shoes?
  ans:
  - well, i suspect it will hurt.

- que:
  - what happened to your shoes?
  ans:
  - they kind of got ahead of me.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - that's just wonderful.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - you're lucky to get four words out of them in english.

- que:
  - why not religion, dad?
  ans:
  - it's rude to talk about religion.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - oh, i was dreaming.

- que:
  - what were you dreaming about?
  ans:
  - oh, i don't usually remember...... unless they're especially portentous.

- que:
  - do you know what that word means?
  ans:
  - it means when you dream about something that's gonna happen.

- que:
  - can i take your picture?
  ans:
  - oh, you don't need a picture.

- que:
  - please?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - oh, must it all end in violence?
  ans:

- que:
  - wouldn't you agree, simba?
  ans:

  ans:
  - hey, i've got an idea.

- que:
  - why don't we tell them our story?
  ans:
  - i like the sound of that.

- que:
  - because what they don't know is how we really were there... even though they didn't know we were there, you know?
  ans:
  - couldn't have said it better myself.

- que:
  - so, does this mean we're going back to the beginning?
  ans:

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's called a skylight.

- que:
  - isn't that creative?
  ans:
  - a skylight.

- que:
  - what's the point?
  ans:
  - all we do is dig... so we can hide, and hide so we can dig.

- que:
  - what's so bad about dreaming of a better home?
  ans:
  - i want to show you something.

- que:
  - what can i say?
  ans:
  - it's nature's design.

- que:
  - but when they die, they become the grass... and we eat the grass, right?
  ans:
  - not exactly.

- que:

- que:
  - isn't that what you want?
  ans:
  - or maybe you would rather have him... go back on the digging crew.

- que:
  - now... what do we do if we see a hyena?
  ans:
  - that's right, mister... because the world out there is fraught with danger.

- que:

  ans:
  - ah, well.

- que:
  - strange but wise monkey?
  ans:
  - you know, first impressions are very important.

- que:

- que:
  - hey, what about you?
  ans:
  - you're all alone.

- que:
  - you are all alone, aren't you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - even the hungry ones?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - must be the gleam on those vicious tusks, huh?
  ans:
  - strikes fear into their hearts.

- que:

  ans:
  - to get me to a little worry free haven... out by that big pointy rock.

- que:
  - and you want me to come with you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - beyond what i see.

- que:
  - who cares?
  ans:
  - it's not important.

- que:
  - look, sire, how they kneel before the royal son.
  ans:
  - don't you know the shortest distance... between me and my dream home... is a straight line?

- que:
  - and i don't gotta share it with anybody.
  ans:
  - so, i guess that's your special power, huh?

- que:
  - lonely?
  ans:
  - we should go say hello.

- que:
  - how do you know when you're there?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you how i know.

- que:
  - beyond what you...
  ans:
  - after all... this is an elephant graveyard... this is an elephant graveyard... and who would ever come to an elephant graveyard?

- que:
  - hey, how am i supposed to look beyond what i see beyond that?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - shall we run for our lives?
  ans:
  - technically, no.

- que:
  - were you just picking your nose?
  ans:
  - no, i had an itch on the inside.

- que:
  - timon, you ok?

- que:
  - what, you're all alone in this big empty world?
  ans:
  - the truth is...

- que:
  - timon, are you crying?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - why'd we ever listen to that stupid monkey?
  ans:
  - i think maybe you're giving up too soon, timon.

- que:
  - remember that place i told you about?
  ans:
  - i'm dying here.

- que:
  - wahh ahh ahh... come again?
  ans:
  - hey, timon, i got an idea.

- que:
  - you just can't help yourself, can you?
  ans:
  - i see.

- que:
  - you used a metaphor on timon?
  ans:
  - he takes things literally.

- que:
  - nice to have a supportive family, isn't it?
  ans:
  - well, here i go.

- que:
  - this bowling for porcupines wasn't the best idea, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what do you say, one more round?
  ans:
  - oh, sure.

- que:
  - oh, please, oh, please?
  ans:
  - nah, pumbaa, i'm beat.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - one more run won't change our lives.

  ans:
  - actually, i...

- que:
  - why don't you sleep over here with us?
  ans:
  - mi pumbaa, su pumbaa.

- que:
  - had a little too much hakuna matata?
  ans:
  - sonny boy, i invented hakuna matata.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - well, i perfected it.

- que:
  - pumbaa, who holds the record... for the world's longest bug belch?
  ans:
  - that would be simba.

- que:
  - who's the champion at slug swallowing?
  ans:
  - simba again.

- que:
  - cricket crunching?
  ans:
  - simba.

- que:
  - grub gulping?
  ans:
  - simba.

- que:
  - nala?
  ans:
  - how did you...

- que:
  - like two soul mates joined across the years... by the bonds of true love?
  ans:
  - sweet, innocent little pumbaa.

- que:
  - can you feel the love tonight?
  ans:
  - that's so romantic.

- que:
  - the peace the evening brings?
  ans:
  - well, that worked like a dream.

- que:
  - can you feel the love tonight?
  ans:
  - she's making those eyes.

- que:
  - you never give up, do you?
  ans:
  - we won.

- que:
  - and that's a good thing?
  ans:
  - he seems to be taking it kind of hard.

- que:
  - what do you mean, he's gone?
  ans:
  - it's just like the baboon said.

- que:
  - you want me to go over it again?
  ans:
  - yes, please, but be a dear... and just skip to the part about simba... not that your childhood wasn't fascinating.

- que:
  - why is she toying with us?
  ans:
  - this crazy chick is going to eat us.

- que:
  - but, timon, it's not really hakuna matata without simba.
  ans:
  - don't you get it?

- que:
  - not hakuna matata?
  ans:
  - that's crazy talk... crazy talk, i tell you.

- que:
  - you're just going to walk away, give up on all this?
  ans:
  - i was about to ask you the same thing.

- que:
  - did you find hakuna matata?
  ans:
  - well, yes, i did.

- que:
  - why should i be miserable?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - would you mind?
  ans:
  - thanks.

  ans:
  - ma'am, a long time ago at st. andrew's... they had a meeting to try and figure that out.

  - setting a bad example for your son?
  ans:
  - getting little bob outdoors... has done wonders for his health.

  - because i play golf with asa kindler and bob woodruff.

- que:
  - so you're telling me that it's not your merit as a lawyer... that's advancing your career?

  ans:

- que:
  - but you know what i've learned?
  ans:

  ans:
  - he told me to go to hell.

- que:
  - robert jones, what is on your mind?
  ans:
  - because we know it ain't my cooking.

- que:
  - ln six years, have we spent even one together?
  ans:
  - well, if you're going to go... then go.

  ans:
  - it's one of your favorites.

  - i think i tried to avoid the papers for a time.

- que:
  - but you know... this is where it stops, don't you?
  ans:
  - lf you pull off this grand slam thing... then i am nothing but a footnote.

- que:
  - who's gonna be second, walter?
  ans:
  - tell me something, fellows.

- que:
  - why is it, whenever i fail to stop this amateur... the rest of you curl up and die, too?
  ans:
  - all this damn part timer has to do is show up... and the best pros in the business drop dead.

- que:
  - one of you better step up in the final round, you hear me?
  ans:
  - go to hell, hagen.

- que:
  - so, jones, when are you gonna cash in?
  ans:
  - hagen's pitching that hair tonic, which is why you never see him wear a hat.

- que:
  - they pay a man not to wear a hat, can you believe that?
  ans:
  - hair tonic, shaving cream.

- que:
  - so, what's holding up your parade, sport?
  ans:

  ans:
  - to be an amateur is to love the game.

- que:
  - so, what are you, jones, some kind of idiot?
  ans:

  - in 1978, sigmund jhn was the first german cosmonaut in space.

- que:
  - which objectives did we set, which objectives did we realize?
  ans:
  - today is our country's anniversary.

- que:
  - isn't that wonderful?
  ans:
  - not everyone wants to join in with career addiction and aggressive marketing.

- que:
  - i would never, ever...... make more than one.
  ans:
  - how do you plead?

- que:
  - show us that there is something inside you that is good.
  ans:
  - what is that monstrosity?

  - hmm?

- que:
  - uncomfortable?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - he's headed for the power...... grid.
  ans:
  - does this, uh, look infected to you?

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - i don't think he's on the ship anymore.

- que:
  - where will he exit?
  ans:
  - water.

- que:
  - how much time do we have?
  ans:
  - agent pleakley at your service.

- que:
  - the mosquito's food of choice, primitive humanoid life forms have colonies all over that planet.
  ans:
  - can we not simply destroy the island?

- que:
  - are they intelligent?
  ans:
  - no, but they're very delicate.

- que:
  - it's fascinating, isn't it?
  ans:
  - with this, i've been able to study...

- que:
  - he got away?
  ans:
  - i'm sure this comes as no surprise to you.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - and to reward you we are willing to trade your freedom for his capture.

- que:
  - who's going to control him?
  ans:
  - you will.

- que:
  - lilo, why are you all wet?
  ans:
  - it's sandwich day.

- que:
  - lilo, lilo, why is this so important?
  ans:
  - pudge controls the weather.

- que:
  - does this look infected to you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - nice to meet you, mister...?
  ans:

- que:
  - are you going to invite me in, nani?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - do you often leave your sister home alone?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:

  ans:
  - we're getting off the subject.

- que:
  - are you happy?
  ans:
  - i'm adjusted.

- que:
  - disciplined?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - bricks?
  ans:
  - uh huh, in a pillowcase.

- que:
  - thirsty?
  ans:
  - let me illuminate to you the precarious situation in which you have found yourself.

- que:
  - we're a broken family, aren't we?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and you like me better as a sister than a rabbit, right?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - you hit her?
  ans:
  - before i bit her.

- que:
  - my camera's full again.
  ans:
  - yeah?

- que:
  - maybe send me an angel... the nicest angel you have.
  ans:
  - aren't they beautiful?

- que:
  - what we when hit?
  ans:
  - there it is.

- que:
  - we're looking for something that can defend itself... something that won't die... something sturdy, you know?
  ans:
  - like a lobster.

- que:
  - do we have a lobster door?
  ans:
  - we have better dogs, dear.

- que:
  - does it have to be this dog?
  ans:
  - he's all yours.

- que:
  - he's listening for us.
  ans:
  - well, what's he doing?

- que:
  - how good is his hearing?
  ans:
  - i mean, can he...

- que:
  - okay, i got to get to work.
  ans:
  - why don't you run?

- que:
  - stick around town and stay out of the roads, okay?
  ans:
  - i'll meet you at 1:00.

- que:
  - okay, i guess we should be going.
  ans:
  - hmm?

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry i bit you and pulled your hair and punched you in the face.

- que:
  - you sure it's a dog?
  ans:
  - nah, just the stage.

- que:
  - maybe some other time, okay?
  ans:
  - don't worry.

- que:
  - is that your dog?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - well, who wants to work at this stupid... fakey luau anyway.

- que:
  - did you lose your job because of stitch and me?
  ans:
  - nah.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - he hasn't been here that long.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - o'hana means family.

- que:
  - or...?
  ans:
  - or forgotten.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - doesn't spill.

- que:
  - push that over.
  ans:
  - why not try and make something for a change?

- que:
  - it keeps staring at me, like it's going to eat me.
  ans:
  - what are you doing?

- que:
  - are you there?
  ans:
  - now, this is interesting.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - 6 2 6 was designed to be a monster but now he has nothing to destroy.

- que:
  - that's the ugly duckling.
  ans:
  - what must it be like to have nothing... not even memories to visit in the middle of the night?

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - he's sad because he's all alone and nobody wants him but on this page, his family hears him crying and they find him.

- que:
  - want to listen to the king?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - what is that thing?
  ans:
  - that's my puppy.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - thus far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience but i cannot ignore you beingjobless.

- que:
  - do i make myself clear?
  ans:
  - i am all about coffee.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - now you try.

- que:
  - howzit...
  ans:
  - really?

- que:
  - nani?
  ans:
  - we've been having a bad day.

  ans:

- que:
  - jumba?
  ans:
  - jumba, help me out here.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - oh... some lolo must have stuffed us in the barrel.

  - what happened?
  ans:
  - lilo, look at me.

- que:
  - are you hurt?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:

  ans:
  - no, david.

- que:
  - what happened to yours?
  ans:
  - i hear you cry at night.

- que:
  - do you dream about them?
  ans:
  - i know that's why you wreck things and push me.

- que:
  - have you captured 6 2 6 or not?
  ans:
  - um...

- que:
  - how soon will you be prepared to leave?
  ans:
  - immediately.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - family.

- que:
  - baby, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - stitch left.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - it's good he's gone.

- que:
  - lilo?
  ans:
  - baby, this is really important.

- que:
  - lock the door and don't answer it for anyone, okay?
  ans:
  - things are finally turning around.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you?
  ans:
  - aliens are attacking my house.

- que:
  - lilo, who was that?
  ans:
  - trust me.

- que:
  - silly me.
  ans:
  - you're one of them?

- que:
  - i know you had something to do with this.
  ans:
  - lilo?

- que:
  - okay, okay.
  ans:
  - now where is lilo?

- que:
  - where's lilo?
  ans:
  - lilo...

- que:
  - galactic command?
  ans:
  - experiment 6 2 6 is in custody.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - don't interact with her.

- que:
  - see, problem is... we're just here for him.
  ans:
  - where's lilo?

- que:
  - so she's gone?
  ans:
  - look at the bright side.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - o'hana means family.

- que:

  ans:
  - rescue.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - does stitch have to go in the ship?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - can stitch say good bye?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - this is my family.

- que:
  - does he really have to go?
  ans:
  - you know as well as i that our laws are absolute.
