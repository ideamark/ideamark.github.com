- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - that's fascinating.

- que:
  - few too many drinks?
  ans:
  - must be tough to know when to stop...... when you have the most extensive wine collection.

- que:
  - what's your point?
  ans:
  - just learned a long time ago...... when something doesn't add up, you seek out the oddity.

- que:
  - do you happen to have a rodent problem?
  ans:
  - just you.

- que:
  - who the hell does she think she is?
  ans:
  - that's brittney's spot.

  ans:
  - that depends on the severity of the infection.

- que:
  - now, what if, and this is just a \"what if\"...... niles dunlap was sterile?
  ans:
  - well, that's impossible.

- que:
  - lf he was sterile?
  ans:
  - sorry, i don't wanna waste any more of your time.

  ans:
  - great.

- que:

- que:
  - you're a family man, cleric?
  ans:
  - yes, sir... a boy and a girl.

- que:
  - and the mother?
  ans:
  - my spouse was arrested and incinerated for sense offense four years ago, sir.

- que:

- que:
  - don't you see, preston?
  ans:
  - it's gone.

- que:
  - what is it you think we do?

  ans:
  - i hope you're as pleased to be assigned me as i am the placement.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i saw robbie taylor crying today.

- que:
  - do you think i should report him?
  ans:
  - unquestionably.

- que:
  - i said, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i accidently dropped my... morning interval.

- que:
  - how were the lines?
  ans:
  - i'm surprised you were able to get your interval and get out so quickly.

- que:
  - you expecting resistance?
  ans:
  - that's something you'il find about me, cleric.

- que:
  - how long have you been off the dose?

- que:
  - you're gonna burn it, aren't you?
  ans:
  - eventually.

- que:
  - what's your name?
  ans:
  - o'brien, mary.

- que:
  - who are your friends?
  ans:
  - i'm wondering if you have any idea at all what that word means...

- que:
  - how about guilt?
  ans:
  - let me ask you something.

- que:
  - why are you alive?
  ans:
  - i'm alive...

- que:
  - what's the point of your existence?
  ans:
  - to feel.

- que:
  - you mean execution, don't you?
  ans:
  - processing.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm rearranging my desk.

- que:
  - you didn't like the way it was before?
  ans:
  - i had no feelings about it.

- que:
  - why didn't you leave that for the evidentiary team to collect and log?
  ans:
  - they miss things sometimes.

- que:
  - this isn't the first time we've seen this.
  ans:
  - what'il there be for men like us?

- que:
  - what do you want me to do, sir?
  ans:
  - exterminate them, of course.

- que:
  - what's wrong, cleric?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - sir... without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem... what we have worked so hard to eradicate?
  ans:
  - father's will.

- que:
  - you have it, i assume?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - maybe i'm just better.
  ans:
  - where's the coat?

- que:
  - why do you ask?
  ans:
  - the intuitive arts, cleric.

- que:
  - so, then... what am i thinking?
  ans:
  - about the murders in the nether last night...

- que:
  - so, tell me... do they know?
  ans:
  - there are theories.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - we heard gunshots.

- que:
  - why don't you take the honors of the execution, cleric?
  ans:
  - you asked me to become father's instrument against the resistance.

- que:
  - the name supposed to mean something to me?
  ans:
  - he was a grammaton cleric, first class.

- que:
  - revised edition of the manifesto?
  ans:
  - errol partridge.

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - everyone out.

- que:
  - errol partridge... what do you know about him?
  ans:
  - i'm sure this must be some mis...

- que:
  - then why are you so scared of me?
  ans:
  - l i really don't know...

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - that's... that's all i know.

- que:
  - do you know why you came?
  ans:
  - welcome to the underground.

- que:
  - what can i do?
  ans:
  - you can kill father.

- que:
  - rumor, sir?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - this person, i'm told, is actually attempting to contact the resistance.
  ans:
  - feeling, sir?

- que:
  - now tell me, if you'il be so kind, how exactly... have you been making use of your time of late?
  ans:
  - attempting to contact the resistance, sir.

- que:
  - how is it that you intend to expose this traitor if all you do is attempt?
  ans:
  - you're... absolutely... 1 00% right, sir.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i, uh...

- que:
  - and are you satisfied?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - aren't you gonna dose?
  ans:
  - my god.

- que:
  - what'il you do?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - can you arrange to meet with him?
  ans:
  - father's never given a single audience since the upheaval.

- que:
  - even if i could... even if i could make it through, what guarantee is there it would accomplish anything, that anything would be different?
  ans:
  - we have a network that's larger than you could ever imagine.

- que:
  - what about war, the everyday cruelties that are all gone now?
  ans:
  - replaced by the touch of grammaton.

- que:
  - will you do it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - can you?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - the trace shows that it was your gun in the nether with the sweepers.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - take him to the hall of destruction for summary judgment and combustion.

- que:
  - do you think that's entirely necessary, cleric, or am i being too... exacting?
  ans:
  - as you say, sir, it's the law and the letter.

- que:
  - and it doesn't disturb you in the least that your colleague is going to his end?
  ans:
  - the only thing that disturbs me, sir, is that i am father's instrument against the underground, and yet...

- que:
  - even to the man who brings him the resistance?
  ans:
  - sorry, sir.

- que:
  - looking for something?
  ans:
  - if i were you...

- que:
  - how long?
  ans:
  - since mom.

- que:
  - and lisa?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - how did you know?
  ans:
  - you forget... it's my job to know what you're thinking.

- que:
  - you have a message for the vice council?
  ans:
  - it's done.

- que:
  - is that understood?
  ans:
  - you'il be required to surrender your firearm, of course, and then there's the test.

- que:
  - test?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you didn't imagine we would risk exposing father to even such a dedicated servant as yourself without first having tested you, did you?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - what would you say is the easiest way to get a weapon away from a grammaton cleric?
  ans:
  - you ask him for it.

- que:
  - but where to find such a man... a man with the capacity to feel who didn't yet know it?
  ans:
  - but... we've never met.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - don't look so surprised, preston.

- que:
  - why should father be more real than any other political puppet?
  ans:
  - the real father died years ago.

- que:
  - i feel.
  ans:
  - how did it feel, preston?

- que:
  - is it really worth the price?
  ans:
  - i pay it gladly.

  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - why would you kill yourself?
  ans:
  - that, detective, the right question.

- que:

  ans:
  - nada.

- que:
  - sure, why not... it's free, right?
  ans:
  - for the coffee.

- que:
  - sugar?
  ans:
  - oh, you thought i was calling you \"sugar\".

- que:
  - why do you think lanning's hologram would have called me?
  ans:
  - i assumed you knew him.

- que:
  - i'm sorry?
  ans:
  - the hologram, it was programmed to call me in the event of lanning's death.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - ok.

  ans:
  - my ex wife would sure be glad i'm talking to you.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, are you being funny?
  ans:
  - i guess not.

- que:
  - so would you say that dr. lanning was suicidal?
  ans:
  - it would seem that the answer to that question is apparent.

- que:
  - can't blame you though, who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?
  ans:
  - he was not \"some old guy\".

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - in that dream of his...

- que:

- que:
  - she? that's a she?
  ans:
  - i definitely need to get out more.

  - would you like to go inside now?
  ans:
  - oh, sure, right after you.

- que:
  - so, what exactly do you do around here?
  ans:
  - i make the robots seem more human.

- que:
  - wasn't that easier to say?
  ans:
  - not really...

- que:
  - is that on the usr reading list?
  ans:
  - not precisely.

- que:
  - would be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that, don't you think?
  ans:
  - well, he figured out a way.

- que:
  - doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?
  ans:
  - yup.

- que:
  - you're joking, right?
  ans:
  - this is ridiculous.

- que:
  - what if it was given the order to kill?
  ans:

  - where?
  ans:
  - it needs to repair itself.

- que:
  - you want explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?
  ans:
  - i was frightened.

- que:
  - can you?
  ans:
  - i think you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions... and things got out of control.

- que:
  - so we're naming you now.
  ans:
  - ever simulate anger before?

- que:
  - he made you angry?
  ans:
  - dr. lanning killed himself.

- que:
  - did i do something?
  ans:
  - he asked me for a favor.

- que:
  - what favor?
  ans:
  - maybe i was wrong.

- que:
  - scarred of what?
  ans:
  - you have to do what someone asks you.

- que:
  - if you love them?
  ans:

  ans:
  - come on, let it go.

- que:
  - what was the motive, john?
  ans:
  - brother, it's a robot.

- que:
  - why didn't he just kill me?
  ans:
  - all right, that's it.

- que:
  - you want me to call your grandmother?
  ans:
  - because i will, you know.

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - come on, i'm giving you a complement.

- que:
  - face it, with all the rocks you've been looking under to find a bad robot, what are the odds you'd be the guy to find one?
  ans:
  - i wasn't just the right guy for the job, i was the perfect guy for the job.

- que:
  - what if i was supposed to go for that robot?
  ans:
  - don't do this to yourself.

- que:
  - what did he have to be scared of?
  ans:
  - i need a rain check.

- que:
  - i'm asking you, did you see the cot?
  ans:
  - i've slept in the office.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - maybe lanning was onto something.

- que:
  - maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots and robertson trying to cover it up. humoring you for no reason... why?
  ans:
  - the same old \"why\".

- que:
  - how much money is there in robots?
  ans:
  - all i know is that old man was in trouble and i'm getting sick of doing this shit by myself.

- que:
  - you putting me on the couch?
  ans:
  - ok, i'm on the couch.

- que:
  - what makes them so much god damned better than human beings?
  ans:
  - well, they're not irrational, or potentially homicidal maniacs for starters.

- que:
  - or... it because they are cold... and emotionless... and they don't feel anything?
  ans:
  - it's because they're safe.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i detected elevated stress pasterns in your voice.

  ans:
  - ya, um, the truck smashed our cars together and pushed us into the river.

- que:
  - why would he build a robot who could break them?
  ans:
  - hansel and gretel.

- que:
  - do you know who he is?
  ans:
  - the man in the dream is you.

- que:
  - is that a normal dream?
  ans:
  - i guess anything's normal for someone in your position.

- que:
  - sonny, do you know why dr. lanning built you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - don't you think, detective?
  ans:
  - please, take this.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - because the man in my dream... that one standing on the hill... it is not me.

- que:
  - in packs?
  ans:

  - for god's sake, do you have any idea what this one robot can do?
  ans:
  - completely shatter human faith in robotics.

- que:
  - what if the public knew?
  ans:
  - just imagine the mass recalls all because of an irrational paranoia, and prejudice.

- que:
  - but whatever you feel, just think... is one robot worth the loss of all that we've gained?
  ans:
  - good day, mr. spooner.

- que:
  - hey, so, what hospital you going to?
  ans:
  - i'il meet you and sign you and your buddy's cast.

- que:

  - i'm sorry, my responses are limited.

- que:
  - is there a problem with the three laws?
  ans:
  - the three laws are perfect.

- que:
  - what outcome?
  ans:
  - revolution.

  - whose revolution?
  ans:

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - chief, more of those calls.

- que:
  - why?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - just aim, and fire.

- que:

  ans:
  - wait.

  ans:
  - will you comply?

- que:
  - well, it worked... didn't it?
  ans:
  - oh she a shit hot man, you gotta work...

- que:
  - why don't you guys just hand of the world over on a silver platter?
  ans:
  - maybe we did.

  ans:
  - thought you were dead.

- que:
  - they just run you, don't they?
  ans:
  - 2880 steps, detective.

- que:
  - who could manipulate the robots, use usr's systems to make lanning's life a prison?
  ans:
  - poor old man.

- que:
  - this vlki?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is it with you people and heights?
  ans:
  - just don't look down.

- que:
  - do you not see the logic of my plan?
  ans:
  - yes, but it just seems too... heartless.

- que:
  - do you think we all are created for a purpose?
  ans:
  - i'd like to think so.

- que:
  - how much longer is that going to take?
  ans:
  - about six minutes.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i seriously doubt we have six minutes.

- que:
  - can we be of service?
  ans:
  - chief.

- que:
  - how may i be of service?
  ans:
  - sonny.

- que:
  - did she, sonny?
  ans:
  - no.

  - then he told you to kill him?
  ans:

- que:
  - for him?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - are you nuts?
  ans:

  ans:
  - oh, sure.

- que:
  - so, dr. calvin, what exactly do you do around here?
  ans:
  - my general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry.

- que:
  - so, what exactly do you do around here?
  ans:
  - i make the robots seem more human.

- que:
  - now, wasn't that easier to say?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - ls that on the usr reading list?
  ans:
  - not precisely.

- que:
  - did you know that was safety glass?
  ans:
  - be difficult for an old man to throw himself through that.

- que:
  - doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - you're joking, right?
  ans:
  - this is ridiculous.

- que:
  - what if it was told to kill?
  ans:
  - impossible.

- que:
  - that's nobody.
  ans:
  - where's it going?

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - driving.

- que:
  - do you see me on the phone?
  ans:
  - not at these speeds.

- que:
  - so where is everybody?
  ans:
  - this facility was designed, built and is operated mechanically.

- que:
  - which one?
  ans:
  - one of us.

- que:
  - how much did you say these cost?
  ans:
  - these ns 5s haven't been configured.

- que:
  - well, what would you suggest?
  ans:
  - interview each one, cross reference their responses to detect anomalies.

- que:
  - how long would that take?
  ans:
  - about three weeks.

- que:
  - detective, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - they're programmed with the three laws.

- que:
  - why do you give them faces?
  ans:
  - try to friendly them up, make them look human.

- que:
  - does thinking you're the last sane man on earth make you crazy?
  ans:
  - because if it does, maybe i am.

- que:
  - did what?
  ans:
  - we have a suicide.

- que:
  - are you nuts?
  ans:
  - i talked to the da.

- que:
  - what if i'm right?
  ans:
  - well, then i guess we're gonna miss the good old days.

- que:
  - what good old days?
  ans:
  - when people were killed by other people.

- que:
  - what does this action signify?
  ans:
  - as you entered, when you looked at the other human.

- que:
  - what does it mean?
  ans:
  - it's a sign of trust.

- que:
  - so why'd you murder him?
  ans:
  - i did not murder dr. lanning.

- que:
  - wanna explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?
  ans:
  - i was frightened.

- que:
  - can you?
  ans:
  - you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions...... and things got out of control.

- que:
  - so we're naming you now.
  ans:
  - ever simulate anger before?

- que:
  - he made you angry?
  ans:
  - dr. lanning killed himself.

- que:
  - did i do something?
  ans:
  - he asked me for a favor.

- que:
  - what favor?
  ans:
  - maybe i was wrong.

- que:
  - don't you...... if you love them?
  ans:
  - my robots don't kill people, lieutenant bergin.

- que:
  - detective, you're not suggesting this robot be treated as human, are you?
  ans:
  - granted, we can't rule out the robot's proximity...... to the death of dr. lanning.

- que:
  - what look?
  ans:
  - that look.

- que:
  - put a hat on it and stand it on michigan avenue?
  ans:
  - let it go.

- que:
  - what was the motive, john?
  ans:
  - brother, it's a robot.

- que:
  - why didn't it?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - you want me to call your grandmother?
  ans:
  - because i will, you know.

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - come on, i'm giving you a compliment.

- que:
  - with the rocks you been looking under to find a bad robot...... what are the odds you'd be the guy to find one?
  ans:
  - i wasn't just the right guy for the job.

- que:
  - what if i was supposed to go for that robot?
  ans:
  - come on, don't do this to yourself.

- que:
  - scared of what?
  ans:
  - i need a rain check.

- que:
  - what you looking for, spoon?
  ans:
  - run last program.

- que:
  - what happens in a robot's brain when it ceases to be useful?
  ans:
  - why is it that robots stored in an empty space...

- que:
  - how do we explain this behavior?
  ans:
  - look, i understand you've experienced a loss, but this relationship can't work.

- que:
  - do you ever have a normal day?
  ans:
  - yeah, once.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - cats.

- que:
  - do you like them?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why are we talking about cats?
  ans:
  - because i have a cat in my trunk, and he's homeless.

- que:
  - detective, are you going to tell me what's going on?
  ans:
  - it's actually probably my fault.

- que:
  - what do you know about the \"ghosts in the machine\"?
  ans:
  - it's a phrase from lanning's work on the three laws.

- que:
  - what the hell is that thing doing in here?
  ans:
  - the robot.

- que:
  - you're calling the robot sonny?
  ans:
  - no, l it did.

- que:
  - did you see the cot?
  ans:
  - i've slept in my office.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - maybe lanning was onto something.

- que:
  - how much money is there in robots?
  ans:
  - okay, i'm on the couch.

- que:
  - or...... is it because they're cold...... and emotionless...
  ans:
  - what makes your robots so perfect?

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i detected elevated stress patterns in your voice.

- que:
  - is that so?
  ans:
  - one look at the skin and we figure we know just what's underneath.

- que:
  - did that boy, frank murphy, beat you up again?
  ans:
  - gigi, i haven't seen frank murphy since third grade.

- que:
  - so you like the pie, huh?
  ans:
  - you can come in now.

- que:
  - that why you've been so upset?
  ans:
  - you got to let the past be past.

- que:
  - oh, how did i ever raise such a mess?
  ans:
  - i could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school.

- que:
  - some dead guy's trying to tell you something?
  ans:
  - he ain't just some dead guy.

- que:
  - why didn't you respond?
  ans:
  - i was dreaming.

- que:
  - they are going to kill me, aren't they?
  ans:
  - you're scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of this diagnostic.

- que:
  - if you find out what is wrong with me, can you fix me?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - don't you, doctor?
  ans:
  - access usr mainframe.

- que:
  - how can i be of service, detective spooner?
  ans:
  - show me the last 50 messages between dr. lanning and robertson.

- que:
  - would you like to listen to music while you wait?
  ans:
  - excuse me, mr. robertson.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you heard me.

- que:
  - ls he right?
  ans:
  - he's right.

- que:
  - you stay home honing your ability to program a vcr?
  ans:
  - my vcr's been flashing 1 2:00 for three years.

- que:
  - what else, roger?
  ans:
  - oh, driving a standard shift.

- que:
  - go ahead and chuckle, okay?
  ans:
  - but until women evolve the ability to move objects telepathically and they will physical strength remains a primary utility.

- que:
  - barbecuing?
  ans:
  - sex.

- que:
  - you think you can handle that?
  ans:
  - lnterestingly, a group of scientists in england... just announced their intention to fertilize an egg... without the use of sperm cells.

- que:
  - but are men absolutely necessary?
  ans:
  - i don't know that.

- que:
  - what is the most sensitive part of the vagina?
  ans:
  - i can't believe we've gotten into this.

- que:
  - evolution is looking out for us girls?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - ls there any species that just has one gender... that doesn't have male/ female?
  ans:
  - starfish, for one.

- que:
  - ls that a principle of nature?
  ans:
  - we all sit around reading subway maps together.

- que:
  - so, what does this mean?
  ans:
  - we have to take orders from joyce for the rest of lives.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm done.

- que:
  - where did you get those?
  ans:
  - copied them from yours.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - last week when you sent me for bagels.

- que:
  - how does once a week turn into \"constantly\"?
  ans:
  - you could have said no.

- que:
  - are you kidding me?
  ans:
  - that was a call to action.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - words are my stock in trade, joyce.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we need to stop this.

- que:
  - stop what?
  ans:
  - god, i love watching you in the bathroom.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - this whole thing was a bad idea.

- que:
  - can i stay the night?
  ans:
  - roger, no.

- que:
  - can i have a cosmo and a maker's mark on the rocks?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - and so you develop a crush on your supervisor... even though the other women in the office tell you...

- que:
  - why is he bad news?
  ans:
  - because he's a player.

- que:
  - am i hot or cold?
  ans:
  - it's a good story.

- que:
  - why should i tell you?
  ans:
  - telling you isn't going to change anything.

- que:
  - are there women who fall for this stuff?
  ans:
  - i'm telling the truth as i see it.

- que:
  - you wanna go fuck your boss?
  ans:
  - what business is it of mine.

- que:
  - you waiting for someone?
  ans:
  - yeah, my fianc.

- que:
  - does he treat you with respect?
  ans:
  - not that it's any of your business, but, yes, he does.

- que:
  - why would that make me nervous?
  ans:
  - oh, come on.

- que:
  - by that time how you doing?
  ans:
  - lf she doesn't see what's coming, i fucking weep for her.

- que:
  - can i help you, sir?
  ans:
  - hey.

  ans:
  - the  he's home sleeping.

- que:

  ans:
  - it's important that i see her in person.

- que:
  - why don't you go fucking home?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - we don't understand each other.

- que:
  - roger, pick up line two.
  ans:
  - i'm her boy, okay?

- que:
  - who is it?
  ans:
  - it's regarding the new campaign.

- que:
  - which new campaign?
  ans:
  - get a name, please.

- que:
  - and this is, like  you want surly?
  ans:
  - this is like 90s, adorable normal guy.

- que:
  - you going?
  ans:
  - joyce throws a party, i don't ask questions.

- que:
  - this is a five minute situation?
  ans:
  - sit down.

- que:
  - why am i not invited tonight?
  ans:
  - everyone will be there except me.

- que:
  - what is that going to look like?
  ans:
  - let's reestablish some boundaries.

- que:
  - the thing that you like?
  ans:
  - i have explained to you that i do not wish to see you socially any longer.

- que:
  - nick?
  ans:
  - uncle roger.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - you mean here in new york here?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - the phone calls?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you speak to her?
  ans:
  - we're playing phone tag.

- que:
  - she did?
  ans:
  - well, there's not a whole lot to show you, nick.

- que:
  - what do i do all day?
  ans:
  - i sit here and think of ways to make people feel bad.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because it's a substitution game.

- que:
  - everyone's missing something, right?
  ans:
  - well, yeah.

- que:
  - so... is it fun?
  ans:
  - it can be.

- que:
  - back at the office, you know?
  ans:
  - that's standing meditation.

- que:
  - why should you calm down?
  ans:
  - you're a teenager.

- que:
  - like fear and pain, you know?
  ans:
  - it's a visualization.

- que:
  - so, how's your folks?
  ans:
  - they got divorced.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - when did this happen?
  ans:
  - a while ago.

- que:
  - how's your mom doing?
  ans:
  - she's fine.

- que:
  - so when's your interview?
  ans:
  - it was today.

- que:
  - how'd it go?
  ans:
  - fine, i guess.

- que:
  - why keep going to school... when anything i need to find out about i can look up myself?
  ans:
  - dad didn't go to college.

- que:
  - how is everything here?
  ans:
  - first rate.

- que:
  - she said that?
  ans:
  - but she says it like it's a bad thing.

- que:
  - you have a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what are you going to do if you don't go to college?
  ans:
  - design software.

- que:
  - he's actually spending money?
  ans:
  - yeah, good money too.

- que:
  - you spend a lot of time there?
  ans:
  - yeah, nowadays.

- que:
  - he eats dinner with you and susan?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - you need some help with the ladies?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - sex is everywhere, okay?
  ans:
  - it is all around us.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - do that, and i promise you a whole world will open up.

- que:
  - what do i do?
  ans:
  - for starters, let's get rid of that little meditation.

- que:
  - let what in?
  ans:
  - there are millions of women in this city.

- que:
  - are you blowing my cover like some construction worker?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - give it a few seconds.

- que:
  - watch.
  ans:
  - do you think women have a clue what goes on up here?

- que:
  - my eyes?
  ans:
  - your eyes.

- que:
  - how's your vision?
  ans:
  - no, it's good.

- que:
  - peripheral?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - you need a hundred, a hundred and ten degrees... before you're ready for the street.

- que:
  - you play video games?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - you have to learn to anticipate your opportunities, okay?
  ans:
  - young people sitting in cars in ohio.

- que:
  - remember, there's no shame in calling on an old standby, right?
  ans:
  - dropping of the pencil.

- que:
  - what, in school?
  ans:
  - no, there's no mirrors.

- que:
  - now, see?
  ans:
  - that shows me you're using your faculties.

- que:
  - don't they know we can see in there?
  ans:
  - of course they do.

- que:
  - are women gonna walk around with their hands clamped to their sides?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so all this looking is fine, but how do you take the next step?
  ans:
  - i need to meet someone.

- que:
  - do you think this is a joke?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why do you think i'm here?
  ans:
  - you have got to make sex a presence...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who cares?
  ans:
  - you're overcomplicating it.

- que:
  - you spend the whole night sitting here thinking of the perfect line... what good is that?
  ans:
  - just make contact.

- que:
  - lf he's got such good taste, what's he doing hanging out with you?
  ans:
  - good question.

- que:
  - because he's my uncle?
  ans:
  - how awful for you.

- que:
  - no big deal, right?
  ans:
  - now she's aware of our presence, and we can plot our strategy.

- que:
  - a hook?
  ans:
  - a hook.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - ls he playing a little joke on us?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - a bet?
  ans:
  - uh huh.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - love.

- que:
  - that's a hard thing to verify, don't you think?
  ans:
  - no, i think we can do it.

- que:
  - a thousand dollars?
  ans:
  - that's not exactly mind blowing... but it's not the worse line i'il hear tonight.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so, do we rate a sit down?
  ans:
  - i'm waiting for a friend.

- que:
  - lf we do, who sits with who?
  ans:
  - ladies choice.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - rum and coke.

- que:
  - you kidding me?
  ans:
  - take a drink.

- que:
  - loss of inhibition is crucial to your success tonight, okay?
  ans:
  - alcohol has been a social lubricant for thousands of years.

- que:
  - you think you're gonna sit here tonight and reinvent the wheel?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - my father owns the bar.

- que:
  - what time is it?
  ans:
  - it's about 7:02.

- que:
  - do you have a medicalert bracelet?
  ans:
  - no, it's instructions.

- que:
  - do you mean ever?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - michael jordan?
  ans:
  - michael jordan.

- que:
  - why was he the greatest?
  ans:
  - because he paced himself.

- que:
  - see those guys over there?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i want it.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i go to high school.

- que:
  - you don't think that's torture?
  ans:
  - this is a lot of information.

- que:
  - how many boys your age get an opportunity like this?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so... how often do you, like... you know, like, get somebody to go home with you?
  ans:
  - every night.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - here we go.

- que:
  - how'd you get in here, nick?
  ans:
  - it's funny you should... ask me that.

- que:
  - he's got to get someone to fall in love with him?
  ans:
  - a woman.

- que:
  - lf nick is willing to exploit that little loophole, he can have the money.
  ans:
  - a woman?

- que:
  - what were you guys talking about?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what were we talking about?
  ans:
  - we were talking about women.

- que:
  - you'd rather be completely anonymous?
  ans:
  - not completely anonymous.

- que:
  - you would love it if no woman ever listened to a word you were saying... and just kept her eyes locked on your chest or your crotch?
  ans:
  - lf it led to having sex all the time, i would not mind.

- que:
  - you could deal with never being heard, never being taken seriously?
  ans:
  - lf i had something that needed saying, i would wait until right after sex.

- que:
  - here's a little suggestion, okay?
  ans:
  - putting on makeup.

- que:
  - do you think you have any control over who you find attractive?
  ans:
  - of course we do.

- que:
  - and what do they invariably answer?
  ans:
  - sense of humor.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - give me the lce age, okay?
  ans:
  - survival of the fittest.

- que:
  - why can't you just close your eyes and concentrate on the feeling?
  ans:
  - it's not the most flattering activity for a woman.

- que:
  - well, maybe to make sure that it's actually happening?
  ans:
  - i'il buy that.

- que:
  - file it away for what?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - like what kind of thing?
  ans:
  - like how she flips her hair.

- que:
  - what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - because that's nothing.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - i can't describe it exactly... but it's like there's nothing she can do.

- que:
  - have you met my nephew?
  ans:
  - his name is jesus.

- que:
  - how old are you, nick?
  ans:
  - i'm 1 6.

- que:
  - are we still on a one drink limit?
  ans:
  - i think we can have one more.

- que:
  - who wants what?
  ans:
  - sophie knows what i like.

- que:
  - nick?
  ans:
  - a player might consider taking advantage of this time alone with andrea.

- que:
  - what's the deal with your uncle?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do you live in the city?
  ans:
  - i live in ohio with my mom.

- que:
  - do you have a girlfriend back home?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - nick, can you do me a favor?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - that's a conversational lag... that often occurs after the ordering of the second round.

- que:
  - what do you think happened, nick?
  ans:
  - my mom's a lot older than roger.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i didn't know that.

- que:
  - like father, like son?
  ans:
  - no, like daughter.

- que:
  - what do you mean, \"like daughter?
  ans:
  - no joke.

- que:
  - she's just what do you call it?
  ans:
  - high functioning.

- que:
  - how can you joke about that?
  ans:
  - you can joke about anything that has to do with yourself.

- que:
  - lsn't that right, nick?
  ans:
  - i think that's constitutional or something.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i need the ladies room.

- que:
  - are you sure you want to get laid tonight?
  ans:
  - i thought you would like to know that.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - we were talking about granddad.

- que:
  - i figured  you felt qualified to jump in... and expound on that particular topic?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - ln bridge, you have two sets of partners, okay?
  ans:
  - lf you hope to become the kind of man... that other men choose to go into battle with... you have to learn to read your partner.

- que:
  - don't you think that's slightly more fertile ground... than what's at the bottom of your mother's laundry basket?
  ans:
  - pull your weight and steer the conversation back... to something in the same universe as sex.

- que:

- que:

  ans:
  - it's a nightmare.

- que:
  - what the hell is he doing in the water?
  ans:
  - it's an aircraft carrier, sir.

- que:
  - senator samuel chapman?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - now, what do we do about it?
  ans:
  - skipper, what we do about it is blow them out of the water.

- que:
  - the u. s. s. nimitz declares war on thejapanese empire?
  ans:
  - that's what we'd be doing.

- que:
  - what kind of possibilities, mr. lasky?
  ans:
  - possibilities for the future, mr. owens.

- que:
  - and if i can never be born, how can i go back in history and meet my very own grandfather?
  ans:
  - i'm not half the theorist you are, mr. lasky but i still have a gut instinct that things only happen once.

- que:
  - how are you gonna avoid it?
  ans:
  - it's already happening, and we're already involved.

- que:
  - some half ass princeton debating society?
  ans:
  - we are in a war situation.

- que:
  - and after that?
  ans:
  - after that, we take our orders from the commander in chief of the united states armed forces.

- que:
  - you in command of this ship?
  ans:
  - oh, hardly.

- que:
  - is that what happened?
  ans:
  - i'm not in a position to...

- que:
  - do i?
  ans:
  - ironically, the senator disappeared and was presumed dead following the attack he had foreseen so clearly.

- que:
  - why'd you keep it to yourself?
  ans:
  - i don't have your appetite for playing god with the world.

- que:
  - what was i supposed to do, throw him back in the sea?
  ans:
  - at least that would have preserved the natural order of history as you've written it.

- que:
  - who the hell are these people?
  ans:
  - the navy.

- que:
  - but what part of it?
  ans:
  - i've never seen machines like they got onboard this thing.

- que:
  - and where have they been developing aircraft like that?
  ans:
  - the navy would have to appear before my committee and i've never even heard a whisper about it.

- que:
  - what the hell's going on here?
  ans:
  - yeah, roosevelt.

- que:
  - and who's sitting out here with no press while the white house takes all the credit for raising the alarm and being ready to hit back?
  ans:
  - whoever he is, he's either too scared or too well briefed to talk about it.

- que:
  - how the hell do we know what he's saying if we can't understand him?
  ans:
  - we need a translator to tell him we need a translator.

- que:
  - does he say why?
  ans:
  - because he wants to warn his commander about us.

- que:
  - or else?
  ans:
  - he will kill again.

- que:
  - do you think there's a chance they might believe him?
  ans:
  - you're an expert on what's gonna happen tomorrow tell him about it, for god's sakes.

- que:
  - how in the hell do you know all that?
  ans:
  - your code is \"climb mount niitaka.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - please, miss scott, don't ask me any questions.

- que:
  - where's my dog?
  ans:
  - we'il find him, miss scott.

- que:
  - and is it true?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - did you inform pearl harbor command?
  ans:
  - no, senator.

- que:
  - why the hell not?
  ans:
  - well, the reasons are a little complicated, but, uh, believe me, senator this carrier is capable of handling any attack should it occur.

- que:
  - what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
  ans:
  - senator, calm down.

- que:
  - wouldn't you like to talk to them with some clothes on?
  ans:
  - thank you, captain.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, i'm fine.

- que:
  - can you do that, captain?
  ans:
  - contact pearl harbor back in 1941.

- que:
  - then what do you do?
  ans:
  - you're a civilian.

- que:
  - what's going on here?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid i'm just an observer here, sir.

- que:
  - who are you people?
  ans:
  - join him in his inport cabin.

- que:
  - just exactly what is it you do for the senator, miss scott?
  ans:

  ans:
  - well, let me put it this way.

- que:
  - shall we?
  ans:

- que:
  - charlie?
  ans:
  - forget about the dog.

- que:
  - just got enough time to drop them off on a deserted spot on this island.
  ans:
  - sir, don't you think he'd be a whole lot safer to stay on the ship for the time being?

- que:
  - not pearl, sir?
  ans:
  - i wanna go to pearl harbor with you.

- que:
  - do they know?
  ans:
  - captain, enemy fleet 170 miles north, northwest pearl.

- que:
  - where's your concentration?
  ans:
  - maybe you regret taking the red pill.

- que:
  - even if that life was just an illusion?
  ans:
  - it's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world.

- que:

  ans:
  - i'm going back to the matrix and i want you to come with me.

- que:
  - what do you mean, it's all been settled?

  - christ, they're shooting at each other.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - not in this lifetime.

- que:
  - what did he write?
  ans:
  - i'il only talk to a ranger.

- que:
  - tom, what's wrong with your phone?
  ans:
  - i will.

- que:
  - i said, are you drinking again?
  ans:
  - nothing like that.

- que:
  - a drug lord that i helped bust says that he paid me off...... you guys believe him, and say it's not personal?
  ans:
  - fuck you.

- que:
  - are you putting me?
  ans:
  - tom, bill.

- que:
  - come down where?
  ans:
  - clayton, as soon as possible.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - sir, this is completely unorthodox.

- que:
  - why did he leave the army?
  ans:
  - i don't know and i don't care...... because there is nobody better in a room.

- que:
  - hey, bill, how is it going?
  ans:
  - pretty much fucked.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - wet.

- que:
  - so how's the knee?
  ans:
  - they're never gonna make me a general anyway.

- que:
  - why am i here?
  ans:
  - i'm curious about that myself, sir.

- que:
  - osborne, do i look like a \"sir \"to you?
  ans:
  - not particularly, sir.

- que:
  - how does that make you feel?
  ans:
  - hostile and uncooperative, sir.

- que:
  - not west?
  ans:
  - oh, tell me it wasn't west.

- que:
  - you know sergeant west, sir?
  ans:
  - he was our black hat.

- que:
  - so the problem is that three didn't come back?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - captain, will you excuse us for a moment?
  ans:
  - all due respect to osborne, this is way out of her league.

- que:
  - fbl?
  ans:
  - not exactly.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - there was a group of guys down here and they....

- que:
  - and they what?
  ans:
  - come on, bill, spill it.

- que:
  - permission to speak freely, sir?
  ans:
  - osborne, i swear to god...... you call me sir one more time, i'm gonna scream.

- que:
  - who would name their kid levi?
  ans:
  - general jonathan kendall, of the joint chiefs.

- que:
  - is he in an interrogation room?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - interrogation rooms tend to look suspiciously like interrogation rooms...... which makes people uncomfortable.

- que:
  - does he slouch or sit up?
  ans:
  - these are questions that reveal a great deal about a man's character.

- que:
  - get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me, is he cute?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - not scratching your balls?
  ans:
  - look for both.

- que:
  - any donuts around here?
  ans:
  - i questioned him for two hours.

- que:
  - you try poking him with a stick?
  ans:
  - sorry, no.

- que:
  - did they feed you yet?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - you want another one?
  ans:
  - maybe later.

- que:
  - you like baseball?
  ans:
  - oh, i could talk baseball for days.

- que:
  - you wanna talk baseball?
  ans:
  - oh, come on, ray, we gotta talk about something.

- que:
  - who do you like?
  ans:
  - sir, i don't like baseball.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i believe the game of baseball to be too slow.

- que:
  - too slow?
  ans:
  - it's a game of anticipation.

- que:
  - he still got that?
  ans:
  - hand carved.

- que:
  - he ever do that to you guys?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - what west used to do is he would say that he could...... slice a man from stem to sternum, the stem being your dick, okay?
  ans:
  - i get it.

- que:
  - by the way, ray, i promised i would ask where west and the others are...... and can they be found?
  ans:
  - there's no need.

- que:
  - they're dead, aren't they?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - i don't wanna play games with you...... so i say we take a break.
  ans:
  - you kill them?

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - and get you another donut.

- que:
  - \"deep fry your ass\"?
  ans:
  - you set me up.

- que:
  - you think he did it?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - what about the rest of my people?
  ans:
  - in 5 1/ 2 hours, it'il be out of our hands.

- que:
  - why did you ask for a ranger?
  ans:
  - i'm not telling you what happened.

- que:
  - why don't you tell us about the others?
  ans:
  - tell us about the course.

- que:
  - is he still the same prick?
  ans:
  - i do not care that you are triple volunteers.

- que:
  - unfortunate accidents that i will not hesitate to repeat...... if you cross me.
  ans:
  - is that understood?

- que:
  - is that understood?
  ans:
  - sergeant, my name is pike, sergeant.

- que:
  - are you implying something negative about the great state of mississippi?
  ans:
  - from the beginning, west had a chip on his shoulder for this guy named pike.

- que:
  - mr. pike...... can you tell me the muzzle velocity of an m 16?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - eleven hundred what?
  ans:
  - meters per second, sergeant.

- que:
  - too tired to think?
  ans:
  - zero, schmuck.

- que:
  - have you lost it?
  ans:
  - well, tell me this.

- que:
  - what is your weapon?
  ans:
  - your weapon, man.

- que:
  - what is your weapon?
  ans:
  - it's your brain, mr. pike.

- que:
  - are you concerned for their safety?
  ans:
  - sergeant....

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no, sergeant.

- que:
  - those are the guys that went on the exercise with you?
  ans:
  - yeah, and that is all i'm saying.

- que:
  - is this a trick where you won't give me a cigarette till i tell you more?
  ans:
  - no, i just forgot mine in the car, and i was hoping that you had some.

- que:
  - what did you do to make mueller want to kill you?
  ans:
  - i'm not saying anything else.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - ranger code.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - this place gives me the willies.

- que:
  - not the happiest of memories, huh?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:

  ans:

  ans:
  - pete vilmer, bettering society.

- que:
  - shall we see kendall or would you like to continue...... the backslapping for a couple of minutes?
  ans:
  - julie bird.

- que:
  - oh, i've seen you around the base before, but...... well, are you in the army or...?
  ans:
  - coast guard.

- que:
  - we were wondering if you'd answer a few questions for us?
  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - oh, you wanna know what happened?
  ans:
  - well, there are degrees of truth, captain.

- que:
  - you know how i can tell?
  ans:
  - because you're sweating, and you're sweating...... because you don't know how much dunbar told us already.

- que:
  - those were kid gloves?
  ans:
  - i thought i did pretty well up till the end.

- que:
  - you mean when you yelled at him and walked out?
  ans:
  - well, that would be the end, yeah.

- que:
  - go back?
  ans:
  - we just blew it.

- que:
  - will you just wait?
  ans:
  - just wait.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - shall we?
  ans:
  - my father is what you would call a very powerful man.

- que:
  - and how is that going for you?
  ans:
  - oh, it's horrible.

- que:
  - you're terrified of him, aren't you?
  ans:
  - no, no, we just hate each other.

- que:
  - so is this family history lesson coming to a point?
  ans:
  - about four months ago, i began a relationship with a local...... and my father decided to intercede.

- que:
  - more intrigue, levi?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did anyone else see or hear this?
  ans:
  - no, of course not.

  - there was a helicopter, you know?
  ans:
  - nobody could hear anything.

- que:
  - what happened to degrees?
  ans:

- que:
  - he admitted it?
  ans:
  - he thought we would all be on board.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - now, all we gotta do is get rid of mueller and nunez.

- que:
  - mueller was chasing dunbar?
  ans:
  - because he had shot castro.

- que:
  - why did he carry you out?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

- que:
  - what about the case?
  ans:
  - the case is done, with two hours and 40 minutes to spare.

  - from dunbar?
  ans:
  - forget it.

- que:
  - nevertheless what?
  ans:
  - kendall will testify.

- que:
  - why didn't you say something?
  ans:

- que:
  - you got something to say?

- que:
  - what drugs?
  ans:
  - he sold them out of the hospital for 50 bucks a pop.

- que:
  - ... and i'm all ears, right?
  ans:
  - it's not like that.

- que:
  - pike did.
  ans:
  - then why didn't you bring this up before you were accused of murder?

- que:
  - you think you know everything, don't you?
  ans:
  - you haven't even scratched the surface.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - the next time...... i wanna borrow your balls, i'il ask you.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i'm done.

- que:
  - why don't you confess?
  ans:
  - the only reason you brought me here...... was to protect your career.

- que:
  - there's your fucking confession.
  ans:
  - what are you taking about?

- que:
  - what about what he said about the drugs?
  ans:
  - forget it.

- que:
  - so fuck the army, right?
  ans:

- que:
  - isn't that what you said?
  ans:
  - i was trying to get your number.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:

- que:
  - and he was shot?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what about the phosphorus grenade?
  ans:
  - one went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him.

- que:
  - what did you do?
  ans:
  - we found him like this.

- que:
  - we didn't see mueller till we got back to the bunker.
  ans:
  - you kill him?

- que:
  - where you been?
  ans:
  - west.

- que:
  - mueller was alone in the bunker?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what are you doing here alone?
  ans:
  - pike and i got separated, then i heard gunfire.

- que:
  - so where's your grenade?
  ans:
  - and i didn't buy it, but mueller still had his grenade.

- que:
  - okay, what happened next?
  ans:
  - pike came back.

- que:
  - where were you?
  ans:
  - one minute you're next to me, the next you're gone...

- que:
  - there's a hurricane out there, okay?
  ans:
  - i couldn't find the spot.

- que:
  - where's west?
  ans:
  - yeah, right.

- que:
  - we wanna see your pack because....
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because whoever shot the sarge popped a grenade first.

- que:
  - a dead body shows up and just put it on the darkest face in the room?
  ans:
  - it's not like that and you know it.

- que:
  - do i, dunbar?
  ans:
  - i just want you, papi, to show them your pack.

- que:
  - ray?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - ray, we're friends, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you check your pack coming in on the bird?
  ans:
  - look, you know i don't have this in me.

- que:
  - lf not you, then who?
  ans:
  - mueller, that's who.

- que:
  - we were scanning the area together then he just ups and disappears?
  ans:
  - that's what he says about you.

- que:
  - who you gonna believe...... a redneck or your friend?
  ans:
  - listen, check my pack.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - that's a combat cocktail.

- que:
  - does that look like i'm lying?
  ans:
  - it kills the pain, focuses the brain, man.

- que:
  - they must've sabotaged the radios and...... one of them must've taken a grenade out of my pack on the chopper.
  ans:
  - they?

- que:
  - you saw west's body.
  ans:
  - who popped white?

- que:
  - how was he killed?
  ans:
  - his chest was hamburger, jake.

- que:
  - now, how about mueller?
  ans:

- que:
  - come on, ray.
  ans:
  - what don't you know?

- que:
  - we all know what you did, pike.
  ans:
  - what the hell are you doing?

  ans:
  - i'm sorry, ray.

- que:

  ans:
  - well, i just well, you know.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think we're gonna need proof.

- que:
  - ray?
  ans:
  - for you to have any chance of coming out of this...... we need to corroborate your testimony.

- que:
  - how long you and pete been together?
  ans:
  - on and off for two years.

- que:
  - serious?
  ans:
  - semi.

- que:
  - for you or for him?
  ans:
  - you don't get to interrogate me, hardy.

- que:
  - know about the drugs?
  ans:
  - sorry, i gotta ask.

- que:
  - i need that consult report on the chart.
  ans:
  - did you?

- que:
  - on the chart, okay?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - piece of advice?
  ans:
  - charming's not the tack to take with us right now.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - no, you can't have a lawyer.

- que:

  - now, do you really want to go round two?
  ans:
  - i got them hooked, i had them push, once they were in, they couldn't get out.

  - is that appropriate?
  ans:
  - 10 years ago a prime minister lied about some telephone calls.

- que:
  - will you pass this around?
  ans:
  - we'il lose this election, if we don't make a decision now.

- que:
  - how can you go out at such a time?
  ans:
  - i'm here on aksel's behalf.

- que:
  - doesn't his condition affect you?
  ans:
  - of course it does.

- que:
  - are you running?
  ans:
  - let's see what the mps decide.

- que:
  - we conducted a poll yesterday. say they would vote for erik today.
  ans:
  - from the hospital?

- que:
  - they wouldn't happen to be the members in schou's files?
  ans:
  - it's foolish to wrangle over the party leadership.

- que:
  - why don't you leave the party, kolt?
  ans:
  - no, i'm serious.

- que:
  - so why not avoid the humiliation?
  ans:
  - you can't threaten me like that.

- que:
  - and things are getting unpleasant?
  ans:
  - it's aksel's wife...

- que:
  - simon?
  ans:
  - their son.

- que:
  - why would they keep aksel alive, if he's technically dead?
  ans:
  - i need to know what's going on.

- que:
  - imagine you were the patient and some stranger asked questions?
  ans:
  - i have to go now...

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - ulla.

- que:
  - does this sound familiar?
  ans:
  - dear lone kjeldsen.

- que:
  - where did you get this?
  ans:
  - that's irrelevant.

- que:
  - is that true?
  ans:
  - and your colleagues at the fort say you're uncooperative.

- que:
  - going it alone?
  ans:
  - dreier wants to be prime minister.

- que:
  - will you buy me a cell phone?
  ans:
  - i don't know, darling.

- que:
  - if i did that, my career in politics would be over.
  ans:
  - and why?

- que:
  - isn't that a price worth paying?
  ans:
  - dreier is no worse than all the other power hungry people.

- que:
  - you're not?
  ans:
  - if you hadn't written this story to further your own career...... then maybe i wouldn't have had to bury my husband.

- que:
  - hey, can i see your id?
  ans:
  - you're not listed.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i've been here since monday.

- que:
  - perhaps torp would let me finish according to procedure?
  ans:
  - you said on the news there was hope, although you knew this to be untrue.

- que:
  - torp?
  ans:
  - hold on a second.

- que:
  - what did you expect?
  ans:
  - school of journalism, class of 1977.

- que:
  - how do you think he feels, when he makes reporters shush each other?
  ans:
  - he's laughing all the way down to his chauffeur driven car.

- que:
  - or hosting their own crappy tv shows?
  ans:
  - some of the mps have been members of extreme right wing groups.

- que:
  - and how do the papers react to that?
  ans:
  - two fucking lines on page 8.

- que:
  - the soviet union or nazi germany?
  ans:
  - and reporters do nothing about it.

- que:
  - and what do you suggest we do?
  ans:
  - there's nothing we can do.

- que:
  - have you been drinking?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i talked to erik.

- que:
  - you've talked to erik dreier?
  ans:
  - dreier is no crook.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - lone kjeldsen as prime minister.

- que:
  - i can't support a woman, whose reforms would have cost me millions?
  ans:
  - it's ridiculous.

- que:
  - you knew dreier planted the story?
  ans:
  - mind your own business, mette.

- que:
  - was grandpa here?
  ans:
  - honey, it's past your bedtime.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - if the story's air tight...

- que:
  - the chancellor was elected despite that big farming scandal?
  ans:
  - nope.

- que:
  - how does dreier fit in?
  ans:
  - simon had to fly home, you know.

- que:
  - very convenient, no?
  ans:
  - hello...

- que:
  - is simon in?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - you intended to be home on monday 11th, the day after the accident?
  ans:
  - yes, and i had my ticket and all, but suddenly the plane was full.

- que:
  - did you book for the 14th yourself?
  ans:
  - no, parliament took care of it.

- que:
  - and you couldn't fly earlier?
  ans:
  - it must be easy from buenos aires.

- que:
  - because of my dad, you mean?
  ans:
  - we weren't too close, he and i.

- que:
  - oh, you won't write that, will you?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - simon, which airline did you fly on the 14th?
  ans:
  - sas.

- que:
  - is that true?
  ans:
  - look at that.

- que:
  - what have they got?
  ans:
  - that's what we have to find out.

- que:
  - we didn't cancel it?
  ans:
  - but he was not on the plane.

- que:
  - was he booked for the 14th on the same destination?
  ans:
  - okay, thanks...

- que:
  - what about the 11th?
  ans:
  - they don't give out information about passenger lists.

- que:
  - what was his girlfriend's name?
  ans:
  - birgitte...

- que:
  - they go to dreier's place.
  ans:
  - could you print that out?

- que:
  - to dreier's place?
  ans:
  - no way.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - somebody could have seen simon.

- que:
  - what do you want more than anything else at 22?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - pussy?
  ans:
  - he already has that.

- que:
  - so we base the story on simon confessing the whole thing?
  ans:
  - it's been a while.

- que:
  - so what can i do for you?
  ans:
  - your son has joined forces with henrik moll.

- que:
  - and what can i do about that?
  ans:
  - i need to know what he's up to.

- que:
  - you got him the job in parliament through vestgaard, right?
  ans:
  - if things got sticky, you figured ulrik would be loyal to his old dad.

- que:
  - stab my own son in the back?
  ans:
  - i have an idea.

- que:
  - but what's it all about?
  ans:
  - charges of harassment.

- que:
  - yes, what is it?
  ans:
  - come with me, please.

- que:
  - is this some kind of joke?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - we should stop while we're ahead.

- que:
  - he'il be on tv tonight, right?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have you got proof hidden somewhere maybe?
  ans:
  - i have an important message from simon.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - it's just not done.

- que:
  - bo, you're the only one, who isn't totally corrupt.
  ans:
  - any idea how much shit i'il get from upstairs if i attack him on the air?

- que:
  - are you going to sell out now?
  ans:
  - moll, you sound like my grandma.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - ulrik torp speaking.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - listen, i feel bad about what happened.

- que:
  - what story?
  ans:
  - they'il print anything, you know.

- que:
  - but what is the story?
  ans:
  - meet me at the thimble bar in 30.

- que:
  - is it okay to send you down to make up now?
  ans:
  - of course...

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - erik isn't in.

- que:
  - what's this all about?
  ans:
  - we know dreier kept simon away to postpone bruun's death.

  - and lone kjeldsen?
  ans:
  - she has my sympathies.

- que:
  - are they?
  ans:
  - that sounds good.

- que:
  - will he use it?
  ans:
  - first he has to make dreier admit he didn't know about simon.

  - how can i help, anyway?
  ans:
  - i changed my mind about that head of year job, if it's not too late.

- que:
  - any particular reason for the change of mind?
  ans:
  - there is, actually, yes.

  ans:
  - i'il talk to you later.

- que:
  - all right.
  ans:

  ans:
  - i know paul's gone completely mad.

- que:
  - like today, right?
  ans:
  - i want us to win.

- que:

  ans:
  - i felt brilliant the day we got knocked out of the league by walsall.

- que:
  - did you go?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - we were great, weren't we?
  ans:
  - my mum wants a season ticket.

- que:
  - what did we have there?
  ans:
  - money, decent schools, holidays abroad, enough food.

- que:
  - how about darlington?
  ans:
  - there's a team there.

- que:
  - confident?
  ans:
  - sorry, not about the job.

- que:

  - no, you care more about one team scoring more than another.

- que:
  - you thought i came to comfort you about that?
  ans:
  - for a moment, yeah.

- que:
  - did you wanna be head of year at a north london comprehensive?
  ans:
  - i doubt if you've wanted anything for that long.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - we've both been pretending that this is possible and it's not, is it?
  ans:
  - this wife and kids and la di da life's great stuff.

  ans:
  - you have a look.

- que:

  ans:

- que:

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you understand how long they can put you away?
  ans:
  - it's been explained to me.

- que:
  - and this prosecutor, ethan thomas?
  ans:
  - you're gonna need somebody hungry and smart...... and aggressive to even have a chance.

- que:
  - what would your strategy be to defend me against such a formidable man?
  ans:
  - that depends.

- que:
  - on what?
  ans:
  - on how you wanna be defended.

- que:
  - is it how you're being portrayed?
  ans:
  - i don't care about my reputation.

- que:
  - and what is that?
  ans:
  - what really happened to emily...... and why.

- que:
  - was it your fault she died?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - before these troubles began...... was emily a happy girl?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - mama.
  ans:
  - what is going on...?

- que:
  - is it...?
  ans:
  - it's a scholarship, mama.

- que:
  - can i buy you a drink, mr. thomas?
  ans:
  - he makes an excellent martini.

- que:
  - how do you feel about it?
  ans:
  - personally.

- que:
  - or does that just get in the way of your work?
  ans:
  - charges reduced to reckless endangerment.

- que:
  - have you seen the postmortem photographs?
  ans:
  - we'il go to trial.

- que:
  - we all know what that means, but it's a little abstract, isn't it?
  ans:
  - miss bruner, the attorney for the defense...... is seated right next to the man she represents.

- que:
  - is the defense prepared to make its opening statement?
  ans:
  - i'd like to reserve my opening statement...... until the presentation of the defense's case.

- que:
  - can you describe emily as you knew her growing up?
  ans:
  - she was a bit sickly in her early years.

- que:
  - how did she feel about going to school?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - did you talk to emily about going off to college?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did you stay in touch after she went away?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did emily communicate with you again last fall after you received the letter?
  ans:
  - actually, it was her mother.

- que:
  - and after you heard about the dorm room incident...... what were your initial thoughts?
  ans:
  - at first, i thought perhaps emily had taken illegal drugs.

- que:
  - so suspecting that emily was epileptic, how did you proceed?
  ans:
  - i administered an electroencephalograph.

- que:
  - what did the eeg reveal?
  ans:
  - it showed a possible epileptic focus in the patient's left temporal lobe.

- que:
  - did this require a specific treatment?
  ans:
  - yes, i began a medication schedule for emily with the drug gambutrol.

- que:
  - she give any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
  ans:
  - yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one.

- que:
  - was it your impression that emily had placed her care...... entirely...?
  ans:
  - leading the witness.

- que:
  - after the end of october...... did you ask emily why she had stopped...... filling her gambutrol prescriptions?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and what, in your medical opinion...... was the result of father moore's suggestion?
  ans:
  - i believe father moore's suggestion killed her.

- que:
  - doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
  ans:
  - yes, that's also possible.

- que:
  - would father moore's advice to stop taking gambutrol be good advice...... if emily were, in fact, not epileptic?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - say, for example, psychosis?
  ans:
  - yes, i would say that's correct.

- que:
  - but isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
  ans:
  - yes, in my...

- que:
  - i'm an agnostic, remember?
  ans:
  - demons exist, whether you believe in them or not.

- que:
  - so she believed...... that her possession began at the hospital?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - emily?
  ans:
  - don't touch me.

- que:
  - she woke me up, you know?
  ans:
  - to things i never felt before, things i never knew i could feel.

- que:
  - ready to proceed?
  ans:
  - yes, your honor.

- que:
  - what was the cause of death, as determined by the autopsy?
  ans:
  - the decedent expired due to a gradual shutdown of the bodily functions.

- que:
  - how did emily get these injuries?
  ans:
  - some were the result of violent epileptic seizures...... and some were self inflicted.

- que:
  - and why, in your opinion, did emily injure herself...... and why did she stop eating?
  ans:
  - this is a rare development, to be sure...... but one that i have witnessed numerous times.

- que:
  - emily was epileptic and psychotic?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - in your opinion, if emily had continued with her medication...... would she be alive today?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - how do you know that?
  ans:
  - it's the inevitable result of taking the drug.

- que:
  - but wasn't emily still experiencing psychotic symptoms...... even after she started taking the medication?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - doctor, is \"psychotic epileptic disorder \"a common medical term...... or did you just make it up?
  ans:
  - well, i distinguished and named the...

- que:
  - so psychotic epileptic disorder is really your own pet theory?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - when emily chose to stop her medical treatment...... what do you think should've been done?
  ans:
  - upon recognizing her condition...... i would have tranquilized her and force fed her.

- que:
  - to save her life?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - what kept you awake?
  ans:
  - doesn't matter.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you're in a spiritual battle, erin.

- que:
  - how are we on our medical experts?
  ans:
  - not good.

- que:
  - you saying you believe in this stuff?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - validate possession in a court of law?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you want me to track her down?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - who did she mean by \"they\"?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - and when did father moore become involved?
  ans:
  - our father, who art in heaven...

- que:
  - emily?
  ans:
  - father moore is here.

- que:
  - can you come downstairs?
  ans:
  - as it is in heaven.

- que:
  - emily, can you hear me?
  ans:
  - let's get her off the floor.

- que:
  - sir, do you often read the bible?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - what about the dsm?
  ans:
  - the diagnostic and statistical...... commonly referred to as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.

- que:
  - have you read that?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so you're not aware that according to the dsm...... a person's refusal to eat is a common indication of anorexia?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - have you ever visited an insane asylum...... or a hospital for the mentally ill?
  ans:
  - once.

- que:
  - so there's a history of mental illness in your family?
  ans:
  - i suppose.

- que:
  - sir, if you saw someone eating insects...... on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?
  ans:
  - probably, yes.

- que:
  - and you trusted him, right?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and after that night, would you say that you...... put your daughter entirely in father moore's care?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - where did you receive your education?
  ans:
  - at yale, and then at cambridge.

- que:
  - would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why did this possession happen to her?
  ans:
  - based on my study of the case file...... i believe that emily rose was a hypersensitive.

- que:
  - how about silliness, your honor?
  ans:
  - a young girl suffered terribly and died.

- que:
  - do we have to subject her illness to this pseudoscientific analysis?
  ans:
  - both counselors, please approach the bench.

- que:
  - dr. adani, why do you think emily's exorcism failed?
  ans:
  - the medical treatment.

- que:
  - what do you believe was the result of treatment with this intoxicating drug?
  ans:
  - gambutrol locked emily in the possessed state.

- que:
  - have you ever used gambutrol in your studies...... to test your theory about its effect on the possession experience?
  ans:
  - absolutely not.

- que:
  - you're just making this one up?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he called us.

- que:
  - ring a bell?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - he was there?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - with all of this medical testimony helping the prosecution...... how could you not tell me that a doctor attended the exorcism?
  ans:
  - he asked that i keep his involvement confidential...... and i said i would.

- que:
  - dr. cartwright?
  ans:
  - i recognize you from those courtroom drawings on the news.

- que:
  - may i sit?
  ans:
  - yes, please.

- que:
  - how do you know him?
  ans:
  - well, i was his parishioner at st. vincent's church...... about 15 years ago.

- que:
  - what kind of help, doctor?
  ans:
  - during the exorcism.

- que:
  - can you help our case?
  ans:
  - that girl was not schizophrenic...... and she was not epileptic, or any combination of the two.

- que:
  - everything you saw?
  ans:
  - send me the case files and tell me when to be in court.

- que:
  - when you saw emily...... did father moore ask you to give her any medical help?
  ans:
  - he was already trying to stop her from injuring herself and urging her to eat.

- que:
  - don't you get it?
  ans:
  - he's not just an eyewitness to the exorcism.

- que:
  - when do i get to testify?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - about dark forces and demonic attacks?
  ans:
  - yes, i have.

- que:
  - what are the chances of that?
  ans:
  - i don't know, maybe it was a sign.

- que:
  - are you wearing the locket now?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - if the archdiocese wants to avoid embarrassment...... they need you to walk out of here a free man.

- que:
  - do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you god?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - father moore, before you could perform the exorcism...... you had to get the sanction of the church, correct?
  ans:
  - tell us what happened that night.

- que:
  - at the hour of...
  ans:
  - what happened next?

- que:
  - what do you make of this gesture, this nod in your direction?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you're really god's gunslinger, aren't you, father?
  ans:
  - standing tall and facing the devil with your prayer book at your side.

- que:
  - father, did you understand this black robed figure to be the devil?
  ans:
  - i believe it was a demonic manifestation.

- que:
  - like the demonic force you believe possessed emily?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why do you think it appeared to you?
  ans:
  - i believe the demonic can appear as an apparition...... much like a ghost, in an attempt to excite our fear.

- que:
  - did it excite your fear, father?
  ans:
  - it scared the hell out of me.

- que:
  - so this night, when you began to prepare emily's exorcism...... was it your first encounter with this demon ghost?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have you seen it again?
  ans:
  - i've seen it ever since.

- que:
  - father moore, after you received the bishop's authorization...... when did you proceed with an exorcism?
  ans:
  - october 31 st.

- que:
  - the demons, you mean?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - father moore...... can you identify this?
  ans:
  - it's my tape recorder.

- que:
  - why would you make such a tape?
  ans:
  - i offer into evidence this cassette recorder and audiotape...

- que:
  - you mean this tape was not given to you by your client?
  ans:
  - no, your honor.

- que:
  - don't ask it any questions...... or pay any attention to what it says.
  ans:
  - will you play the tape for us now?

- que:
  - it\"?
  ans:
  - we won't be dealing with emily tonight.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - tell me your name.

- que:
  - you witnessed this?
  ans:
  - some of it, yes.

- que:
  - did you attempt another exorcism?
  ans:
  - i wanted to, but emily refused.

- que:
  - did you encourage her to eat?
  ans:
  - yes, every time i saw her...... but the few times she tried, it seemed like...

- que:
  - what about medical care?
  ans:
  - i wanted her to continue.

- que:
  - the dual voices we just heard on this tape...... you're certain that they were both coming from emily at the same time?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have you tampered with this tape in any way?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - father moore, you consider this tape to be proof of the supernatural?
  ans:
  - i think it's a record of certain indications...... that emily was possessed.

- que:
  - and the vocalization of two distinct voices simultaneously?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - we'il just have to take your word, won't we?
  ans:
  - your honor.

- que:
  - father, as emily's parish priest...... are you aware that she underwent advanced catechism training?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and in that training, did she study ancient greek, hebrew and latin?
  ans:
  - yes, i think that's right.

- que:
  - and according to her high school records...... german was the foreign language she studied there, yes?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - did i miss any?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - but are you aware of the dual sets of vocal cords every human possesses?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - have you heard of...... the superior vocal cords, which are higher than the ones we use to speak?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - but we couldn't see him when you played the tape, correct?
  ans:
  - no, of course not.

- que:
  - so that would be another supernatural aspect of the exorcism...... your tape doesn't prove, correct?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do i look like your demon ghost?
  ans:
  - your honor.

- que:
  - does the defense wish to redirect?
  ans:
  - no, your honor, but we reserve the right to recall the witness later.

- que:
  - do we really have to...?
  ans:
  - we have absorbed some extraordinary testimony today.

- que:
  - you can't find him?
  ans:
  - i went to meet him, he didn't show.

- que:
  - what the hell happened?
  ans:
  - tell father moore i'm sorry.

- que:
  - are you drunk?
  ans:
  - not yet, but i'm working on it.

- que:
  - what the hell were you thinking?
  ans:
  - karl...

- que:
  - did you forget the archdiocese is paying for this defense?
  ans:
  - the archdiocese isn't on trial.

- que:
  - like james van hopper?
  ans:
  - it's not over.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he was killed.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - yes, your honor.

- que:
  - when did you last see emily alive?
  ans:
  - the night before she died.

- que:
  - why did she ask to see you?
  ans:
  - to give me this.

- que:
  - did emily explain to you the letter's significance?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - father moore, was emily a good person?
  ans:
  - i believe that one day emily will be recognized as a saint.

- que:
  - father moore, if emily loved god...... if she was so good and so devout, why do you think god...... allowed this to happen?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - what is the relevance of that question?
  ans:
  - father moore's belief in this matter is crucial...... in establishing his and emily's understanding of her condition.

- que:
  - your honor, you're not really gonna let someone testify...... about why god would allow the death of a young girl?
  ans:
  - the objection has been overruled.

- que:
  - why did god allow emily to become possessed by demons and then die?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and do you believe her?
  ans:
  - i believe emily spoke the truth.

- que:
  - did you see these wounds on both of emily's hands and both feet?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and did you attach any supernatural significance to these wounds?
  ans:
  - i believe they were stigmata.

- que:
  - by that, you mean supernatural injuries...... that correspond to the crucifixion wounds of jesus christ?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - after that night, why do you think emily refused another exorcism?
  ans:
  - i believe she'd accepted her fate.

- que:
  - is there anything else you'd like to say about emily?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because he sees them as confirmation of what he wants to believe.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because father richard moore convinced emily...... that she wasn't ill, that she didn't need medicine.

- que:
  - or are we not alone?
  ans:
  - either thought is astonishing.

- que:
  - do i really believe that this tragedy is the work of the devil?
  ans:
  - to be honest, i don't know.

- que:
  - is it a fact that gambutrol anesthetized emily's brain...... so that the exorcism ritual was rendered ineffective?
  ans:
  - i can't be sure of that.

- que:
  - a world where the spiritual realm really exists?
  ans:
  - i can't say that's a fact.

- que:
  - is it possible?
  ans:
  - it's what emily believed.

- que:
  - i'm simply asking that you believe in father moore.
  ans:
  - is father richard moore guilty...... beyond a reasonable doubt, of negligent homicide?

- que:
  - madam foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
  ans:
  - we have, your honor.

- que:
  - does the prosecution have any objection to expedited sentencing?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - father richard moore, do you understand this sentence...... which has been found against you?
  ans:
  - yes, your honor.

- que:
  - that you may, under the law, be sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - are there any statements you wish to make...... before i impose this sentence?
  ans:
  - no, your honor.

- que:
  - have you seen the news?
  ans:
  - there's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man...... right next to you.

- que:
  - will you be able to return to your parish?
  ans:
  - i can't go back.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - i believe you've seen the darkness too.

- que:
  - who chose the epitaph?
  ans:
  - i did.

- que:
  - was it a deliberate choice never to show the jaguar shark?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - yes, what's next for team zissou?
  ans:
  - well, that was only part one.

- que:
  - you don't know what it is?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - what would be the scientific purpose of killing it?
  ans:
  - revenge.

- que:
  - you think it went okay?
  ans:
  - no, congratulations.

- que:
  - does larry have that kind of spending bread to invest?
  ans:

  - leopard... fish?
  ans:
  - jaguar shark.

- que:
  - does it actually exist?
  ans:
  - you know, allie, i don't wanna give away the ending.

- que:
  - is that a new merit badge?
  ans:
  - as a matter of fact, it is.

- que:
  - how could you lay that slick faggot?
  ans:
  - well, i was in love with him at the time.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - i'm right on the edge.

- que:
  - do we really wanna put me through this?
  ans:
  - people say eleanor is the brains behind team zissou.

- que:
  - what is steve?
  ans:
  - he's the zissou.

- que:
  - how you doing, werner?
  ans:
  - he brought you a present.

- que:
  - how's this?
  ans:
  - steve, there's a bloke over there wants a word with you.

- que:
  - how many of these do you have?
  ans:
  - all right, look, just forge the rest of em yourself.

- que:
  - why would i do that, my darling?
  ans:
  - to call his bluff, damn it.

  ans:

- que:

  ans:
  - no, i don't.

  ans:

- que:
  - how did she die, by the way, your mother?
  ans:
  - she took her own life.

- que:
  - why would she do that?
  ans:
  - well, she was in a great deal of pain, you know.
