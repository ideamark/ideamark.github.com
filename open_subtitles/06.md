  ans:
  - it's hard when you're made to feel you're the almighty.

- que:

- que:
  - why are we stopping?
  ans:
  - i told you i was in a hurry.

- que:
  - what can i do for you, ma'am?
  ans:
  - i would like some water, if it's no trouble.

- que:
  - water?
  ans:
  - that word is poison around these parts ever since the days of the great flood.

- que:
  - only three people have used it this morning.
  ans:
  - you mean you never wash?

- que:
  - used it one at a time or all together?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you know how to blow music from that?
  ans:
  - pick it up.

- que:
  - you interested in fashions, harmonica?
  ans:
  - i saw three of these dusters a short time ago.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - inside the men, there were three bullets.

- que:
  - that surprise you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - like so?
  ans:
  - i found this collar on a nail by the door.

- que:
  - but why?
  ans:
  - don't worry, mrs mcbain.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - this is my home.

- que:
  - did you make coffee?
  ans:
  - make it.

- que:
  - what the hell?
  ans:
  - i'll kill anything, but never a kid.

- que:
  - so this here's where i was supposed to do all the killing?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what if there were a whole heap of whys?
  ans:
  - round.

- que:
  - by the way, you know anything about a man going around playing a harmonica?
  ans:
  - he's somebody you'd remember.

- que:
  - tell me, was it necessary that you kill all of them?
  ans:
  - i only told you to scare them.

- que:
  - and can you tell me what good was your stupid massacre?
  ans:
  - now, a mrs mcbain has turned up.

- que:
  - how does it feel sitting behind that desk, frank?
  ans:
  - it's almost like holding a gun.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because there are many things you'll never understand.

- que:
  - now, shall we get back to our little problem?
  ans:
  - my weapons might look simple to you, mr morton, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems.

- que:
  - what the hell?
  ans:
  - well, god rest your soul, brett mcbain.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - cheyenne's right.

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:

  ans:
  - i don't know him.

- que:
  - you never thought it wasn't a trick?
  ans:
  - sure, but you know i'm mighty careful.

- que:
  - how can you trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders?
  ans:
  - the man can't even trust his own pants.

- que:
  - so, nobody followed you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did logan and jim take care of the woman?
  ans:

  ans:
  - ok, maybe it's more like two things i haven't tried.

- que:
  - well, what have you tried?
  ans:
  - i have very unsubtly implied how i feel about her.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:

  - when i was a child, my mother thought me devine, my father weak.

- que:
  - and what's the point alexander?
  ans:
  - just take her as your concubine.

- que:
  - exactly, what can be won alexander?
  ans:
  - we came here to asia to punish them for their crimes.

- que:
  - to give these people cities?
  ans:
  - to found cities, and expand our reach is not to drift parmenion.

  ans:
  - we'll be divided.

- que:
  - or the mountains of the hindu kush...... when we crossed a 100, 000 man army into india...?
  ans:
  - he was a god, cadmos...... or as close as anything i've ever seen.

- que:
  - what do they know of the world, these schoolboys?
  ans:
  - it takes strong men to rule.

- que:
  - how can i tell you what it was like...... to be young, and to dream big dreams?
  ans:
  - to believe when alexander looked you in the eye, you could do anything.

- que:
  - if you hesitate, she will strike.

  ans:
  - india, where herakles and dionysus traveled...... all these men who went east, theseus...... jason, achilles, were victorious.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - unless there was truth to them.

- que:
  - tales of amazons?
  ans:
  - no, alexander.

- que:
  - but if we are superior to the persians, as you say, why do we not rule them?
  ans:
  - it is...

- que:
  - why are the persians so cruel?
  ans:
  - when men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions...... and does nothing for the excellence in us.

- que:

  ans:
  - is that the best you can do, cleitus?

- que:
  - it's time.
  ans:
  - and if you don't?

- que:
  - you don't like your shadow, do you?
  ans:
  - it's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

- que:
  - and his fate?
  ans:
  - that he must die young, but with great glory.

- que:
  - miserable fate.
  ans:
  - did he have a choice?

- que:
  - who knows these things?
  ans:
  - anyway...

- que:
  - when i'm king like you one day, father?

- que:
  - would you prefer a seat, cleitus?
  ans:
  - i'll sleep in my grave, hephaistion.

- que:
  - who's your new friend?
  ans:
  - he can't even make it from one couch to the next.

- que:
  - you'll never get within a hundred paces of him.
  ans:
  - kill darius?

- que:
  - have you seen the sheer size of his force?
  ans:
  - not if you hold them on the left, my brave parmenion...... with your son philotas, for just one, two hours tomorrow.

- que:
  - when has a greek ever been given such honors?
  ans:
  - these are not honors, parmenion.

- que:
  - to whom do you pray?
  ans:
  - phobos.

- que:
  - fear?
  ans:
  - it's been too long coming, if you ask me.

- que:
  - did patroclus doubt achilles when they stood side by side at the siege of troy?
  ans:
  - i don't know, majesty.

- que:
  - you bleed free, my lord.
  ans:
  - where is he?

- que:
  - may i tend to your wounds?
  ans:
  - no, hermolaus, not now.

- que:
  - wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
  ans:
  - what shall i call you?

- que:
  - not for the men who fought, i trust?
  ans:
  - we'll pay them well, antigonous... but not as mercenaries for future services.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - i advise you not to touch, leonnatus.

- que:
  - do these images fool us with their beauty and degrade our souls?
  ans:
  - as i am... a princess.

- que:
  - have you any other requests for me, my noble princess?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why won't you ever believe me?
  ans:
  - it is only a dark mind like mine...... that can know these secrets of the heart.

- que:
  - when i'm the cracked mirror of her dreams?
  ans:
  - stay with me tonight, hephaistion.

- que:
  - how so?
  ans:
  - but as alexander's army, they can go where they never thought possible.

- que:
  - is there not love in your life...... alexander?
  ans:
  - i wonder sometimes, if it's not your mother you run from.

- que:
  - who knows these things?
  ans:
  - when i was a child, my mother thought me divine, my father weak.

- que:
  - weak or divine?
  ans:
  - just take her as your concubine.

- que:
  - what can be won, alexander?
  ans:
  - to found cities and expand our reach is not to drift.

- que:
  - share our rewards?
  ans:
  - you remember what aristotle said.

- que:
  - better than you really are?
  ans:
  - in you and those like you is this.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - he is hephaistion.

- que:
  - with your breeding?
  ans:
  - i have given you ample proof.

- que:
  - what to do with parmenion and his 20, 000 troops guarding our supply lines...... was a far more delicate matter.
  ans:
  - who did this?

- que:
  - was he innocent in this...... or had he decided to act before age further withered his power?
  ans:
  - they'll be divided.

- que:
  - you remember what aristotle told us of these mountains?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - have you found your home, ptolemy?
  ans:
  - more and more, i think it will be alexandria.

- que:
  - where has our eagle gone?
  ans:
  - we must go on, ptolemy...... until we find an end.

- que:
  - do they speak?
  ans:
  - only when offered.

- que:
  - you bow before herakles, do you not?
  ans:
  - and he was mortal...... but a son of zeus.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i remember a time when we could talk as men, straight to the eye.

- que:
  - who's with him?
  ans:
  - you made me do your foul deed.

- que:
  - cleitus?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - he doesn't.
  ans:
  - cleitus?

- que:
  - and he needs you?
  ans:
  - hephaistion, you make a mistake.

- que:
  - have i become so arrogant that i am blind?
  ans:
  - sometimes...... to expect the best of everyone is arrogance.

- que:
  - weren't you told?
  ans:
  - i go in alone.

- que:
  - go.
  ans:
  - is that what she wants?

- que:
  - how can you behave so shamelessly in public?
  ans:
  - because it was meant to be.

- que:
  - tell me, or shall i put you on trial for his murder?
  ans:
  - no, never.

- que:
  - why would i?
  ans:
  - even if it was the wish of your heart.

- que:
  - what do you know of philip?
  ans:
  - no, alexander.

- que:
  - have you learned nothing from philip?
  ans:
  - one day, you will understand this...... but i have only you in my heart...

- que:
  - your majesty?
  ans:
  - you break my heart.

- que:
  - you men, afraid?
  ans:
  - my king.

- que:
  - and now when i look around, how many of them faces do i see?
  ans:
  - it was the bloodiest of his battles.

- que:
  - typhus, of india?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't tax yourself, your majesty.

- que:
  - and then what happened?
  ans:
  - ours is a myth only young men believe.

- que:
  - who do you want, alexander?
  ans:
  - fear not.

- que:
  - pray tell us, who?
  ans:
  - it is i who love you more than any.

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - to the best.

- que:
  - why would he say crateros?
  ans:
  - babylon, persia june 323 b. c.

- que:
  - his?
  ans:
  - a burden.

- que:
  - but wasn't it really about alexander, and another population ready to obey him?
  ans:
  - i never believed in his dream.

  ans:
  - oh, i couldn't wait to see you.

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - well, what then?
  ans:
  - i can't swim.

- que:
  - so, you're afraid you'll drown, right?

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - you like the feeling?
  ans:
  - i love it.

- que:
  - you are looking for trouble, aren't you, mister?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, i sure am.

- que:
  - you hear that?
  ans:
  - tuck says it's the most melancholy sound in all of nature.

- que:
  - you want to spend forever with me, winnie?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - the reason you don't want anyone to find out about you?
  ans:
  - i knew it.

- que:
  - you remember when i told you i was 104 years old?
  ans:
  - well... it's the honest truth.

- que:
  - did he tell you immortality isn't all the preachers crack it up to be?
  ans:
  - hey, leave her alone, miles.

- que:
  - then tuck got bitten by a rattlesnake, and you know what?
  ans:
  - he didn't die...... but the cat did of old age.

- que:
  - do you want to stay stuck as you are right now, forever?
  ans:
  - i've just got to make you understand.

- que:
  - is that wrong?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you detect in me a playful mood?
  ans:

- que:
  - wh what is it you want?
  ans:
  - you want your daughter.

- que:

  ans:
  - you're involved in this, aren't you?

- que:
  - nice to have things legal and tidy, don't you agree?
  ans:
  - you're an intelligent, reasonable man, mr. foster.

- que:
  - what kind of horrible people must these kidnappers be?
  ans:
  - there is evil in the world, mr. foster.

- que:
  - how am i going to take you home when i can't make my feet move from this spot?
  ans:
  - if i could die tomorrow, i'd do it... just to spend one more night with you.

- que:
  - you know this man?
  ans:
  - i met him once.

- que:
  - tell me, is it a relief... to finally be discovered?
  ans:
  - over a century of hiding out must have taken its toll on you.

- que:
  - and how do you know so much about us?
  ans:
  - i first heard about your family from my grandmother.

- que:
  - what was it, now?
  ans:
  - anna.

- que:
  - i'm sure you know it, mrs. tuck?
  ans:
  - you have no right... to come to our home... and bring us such pain.

  - what is it you want?
  ans:
  - well, you see, the fosters have given me these woods in exchange for bringing young winifred back home to them.

- que:
  - cooperative?
  ans:
  - i want you to take me to the spring.

- que:
  - they're my friends.
  ans:
  - is that so?

- que:
  - if they didn't kidnap you, why on earth did that woman club that man over the head with a shotgun?
  ans:
  - because mae tuck was protecting me.

- que:
  - i'll come back for you.
  ans:
  - who's after you?

- que:
  - i have to show you the eiffel tower, don't i?
  ans:

  - what did you do and what did you think?
  ans:
  - we said no questions.

- que:
  - why there is no other man in my life?
  ans:
  - that's easy.

- que:
  - ten years ago?
  ans:
  - let's see....

- que:
  - where were you?
  ans:
  - looking for a job.

- que:
  - or my heart pounding?
  ans:
  - it's the german 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

- que:
  - why don't we marry in marseilles?
  ans:
  - that's too far ahead to plan.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i love you so much.

- que:
  - have you seen her?
  ans:
  - i can't find her.

- que:
  - do you hear me?
  ans:
  - come on, mr. richard.

- que:
  - why did you have to come to casablanca?
  ans:
  - there are other places.

- que:
  - how long was it we had, honey?
  ans:
  - i didn't count the days.

- que:
  - can i tell you a story, rick?
  ans:
  - i don't know the finish yet.

- que:
  - was it laszlo, or were there others in between...... or aren't you the kind that tells?
  ans:
  - i suspect ugarte left the letters of transit with mr. blaine.

- que:
  - did you rest well?
  ans:
  - i slept well.

- que:
  - may we proceed with the business?
  ans:
  - with pleasure.

- que:
  - is it possible herr laszlo will receive a visa?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid not.

- que:
  - and mademoiselle?
  ans:
  - you needn't be concerned about me.

- que:
  - is that all you wish to tell us?
  ans:
  - don't be in a hurry.

- que:
  - and that is?
  ans:
  - you know the leader of the underground movement in paris, in prague...... in brussels, in amsterdam, in oslo, in belgrade, in athens....

- que:
  - what if you murdered us all?
  ans:
  - from every corner of europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places.

- que:
  - may i speak to him now?
  ans:
  - you would find the conversation a trifle one sided.

- que:
  - are you finished with us?
  ans:
  - for the time being.

- que:
  - ferrari?
  ans:
  - it can be most helpful to know ferrari.

- que:
  - and the carrying charges?
  ans:
  - naturally, there will be a few incidental expenses.

- que:
  - did i say 700 francs?
  ans:
  - you can have it for 200.

- que:
  - did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the station?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i got stuck with the railway ticket.

- que:
  - hiding from the police, running away all the time?
  ans:
  - believe that if you want to.

- que:
  - you mean for me to go on alone?
  ans:
  - and only alone.

- que:
  - if the situation were different...... if i had to stay and there was only one visa...... would you take it?
  ans:
  - yes, i would.

- que:
  - when i was sick in marseilles for two weeks and you were in danger...... why didn't you leave me?
  ans:
  - i meant to.

- que:
  - you know you're being shadowed?
  ans:
  - it becomes instinct.

- que:
  - have you heard about the letters of transit?
  ans:
  - yes, something.

- que:
  - you know where they are?
  ans:
  - not for sure.

- que:
  - louis, are you pro vichy or free french?
  ans:
  - serves me right for asking a direct question.

- que:
  - would you repeat it?
  ans:
  - what i said is not your business.

- que:
  - you see, captain?
  ans:
  - the situation is not under control.

- que:
  - are you certain which side you're on?
  ans:
  - i have no conviction.

- que:
  - surely the reich doesn't admit that possibility?
  ans:
  - we're concerned about more than casablanca.

- que:
  - like laszlo?
  ans:
  - i have been thinking.

- que:
  - what watch?
  ans:
  - ten watch.

- que:
  - such much?
  ans:
  - you'll get along beautifully in america.

- que:
  - how is lady luck treating you?
  ans:
  - oh, too bad.

- que:
  - how'd you get in?
  ans:
  - you're underage.

- que:
  - he is?
  ans:
  - renault's getting broad minded.

- que:
  - have a drink?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - monsieur rick, what kind of a man is capt. renault?
  ans:
  - he did.

- que:
  - where's your husband?
  ans:
  - at the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas.

- que:
  - how long have you been married?
  ans:
  - eight weeks.

- que:
  - does he know that?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and he's still willing to give you a visa?
  ans:
  - you want to know....

- que:
  - will he keep his word?
  ans:
  - he always has.

- que:
  - you want my advice?
  ans:
  - yes, please.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - here we are again.

- que:
  - could we have a table close to him?
  ans:
  - and as far away from strasser as possible.

- que:
  - do you wish to place another bet, sir?
  ans:
  - no, i guess not.

- que:
  - have you tried 22 tonight?
  ans:
  - leave it there.

- que:
  - honest?
  ans:
  - as honest as the day is long.

- que:
  - how are we doing tonight?
  ans:
  - a couple of thousand less than i thought there would be.

- que:
  - monsieur rick, may i get you a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - no thanks, carl.

- que:
  - why interfere with my little romances?
  ans:
  - put it down as a gesture to love.

- que:
  - i wonder if i could talk to you?
  ans:
  - go ahead.

- que:
  - isn't there some other place?
  ans:
  - it's rather confidential, what i have to say.

- que:
  - isn't it strange you always seem to fight with the underdog?
  ans:
  - i found that an expensive hobby.

- que:
  - are you enough of a businessman to appreciate 100, 000 francs?
  ans:
  - i appreciate it, but i don't accept it.

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - i said, ask your wife.

- que:
  - my wife?
  ans:
  - i'm shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.

- que:
  - occupied france?
  ans:
  - under safe conduct from me.

- que:
  - of what value is that?
  ans:
  - remember what german guarantees have been worth in the past.

- que:
  - what are they?
  ans:
  - french authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

- que:
  - the other alternative?
  ans:
  - perhaps you have already observed that, in casablanca, human life is cheap.

- que:
  - what happened with rick?
  ans:
  - we'll discuss it later.

- que:
  - or carry on the best i can?
  ans:
  - whatever i'd say, you would carry on.

- que:
  - what did you find out?
  ans:
  - apparently he has the letters.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - but he won't sell them.

- que:
  - did he give you any reason?
  ans:
  - he suggested i ask you.

- que:
  - ask me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - when i was in the concentration camp...... were you lonely in paris?
  ans:
  - yes, victor.

- que:
  - is there anything you wish to tell me?
  ans:
  - no, victor.

- que:
  - yes, dear?
  ans:
  - be careful.

- que:
  - how long can i afford to stay closed?
  ans:
  - two weeks, maybe three.

- que:
  - you finish locking up, will you?
  ans:
  - i will.

- que:
  - how did you get in?
  ans:
  - the stairs from the street.

- que:
  - won't you sit down?
  ans:
  - richard, i had to see you.

- que:
  - your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?
  ans:
  - as long as i have them, i'll never be lonely.

- que:
  - do i have to hear again how great your husband is...... what an important cause he's fighting for?
  ans:
  - it was your cause too.

- que:
  - you want to feel sorry for yourself?
  ans:
  - with so much at stake, all you can think of is your own feeling.

- que:
  - what of it?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna die in casablanca.

- que:
  - and then?
  ans:
  - it wasn't long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia.

- que:
  - why keep your marriage a secret?
  ans:
  - it wasn't my secret, richard.

- que:
  - when did you first find out he was alive?
  ans:
  - just before you and i were to leave paris.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you'll help him now, won't you?
  ans:
  - you'll see that he gets out.

- que:
  - carl, what happened?
  ans:
  - the police break up our meeting.

- que:
  - had a close one?
  ans:
  - yes, rather.

- que:
  - don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?
  ans:
  - i mean, what you're fighting for.

- que:
  - what of it?
  ans:
  - then it'll be out of its misery.

- que:
  - you know how you sound?
  ans:
  - like a man who's convincing himself of something he doesn't believe.

- que:
  - you love her that much?
  ans:
  - apparently, you think of me only as the leader of a cause.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - come with us.

- que:
  - on what charge?
  ans:
  - because, one, you bet 10, 000 francs he'd escape.

- que:
  - what friend?
  ans:
  - ilsa lund.

- que:
  - why do you still care what happens to laszlo?
  ans:
  - i'm not.

- que:
  - why do you think we want to hold you?
  ans:
  - ilsa is laszlo's wife.

- que:
  - how do i know you'll keep your bargain?
  ans:
  - i'll make the arrangements with laszlo in the visitor's pen.

- que:
  - should we draw it up, or is a handshake good enough?
  ans:
  - certainly not good enough.

- que:
  - is everything ready?
  ans:
  - i have the letters here.

- que:
  - when we searched the place, where were they?
  ans:
  - sam's piano.

- que:
  - haven't you told him?
  ans:
  - not yet.

- que:
  - but it's all right, isn't it?
  ans:
  - everything's quite all right.

- que:
  - you won't have trouble in lisbon?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you're surprised about ricky?
  ans:
  - the explanation is simple.

- que:
  - have you taken leave of your senses?
  ans:
  - i have.

- que:
  - i wonder if you realize what this means?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - hello? ls that the airport?
  ans:
  - capt. renault speaking.

- que:
  - hello, radio tower?
  ans:
  - lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway.

- que:
  - you think of everything, don't you?
  ans:
  - the names are mr. and mrs. victor laszlo.

- que:
  - but...... why my name?
  ans:
  - you're getting on that plane.

- que:
  - but what about you?
  ans:
  - i'm staying here till the plane gets away.

- que:
  - what's happened to you?
  ans:
  - last night we said a great many things.

- que:
  - do you know what you'd have to look forward to here?
  ans:
  - we'd both wind up in a concentration camp.

- que:
  - isn't that true?
  ans:
  - maj. strasser would insist.

- que:
  - but what about us?
  ans:
  - we'll always have paris.

- que:
  - isn't that true?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - are you ready?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm ready.

- que:
  - what was the meaning of that phone call?
  ans:
  - victor laszlo is on that plane.

- que:
  - why not stop him?
  ans:
  - ask monsieur rick.

- que:
  - my letter of transit?
  ans:
  - i could use a trip.

- que:
  - did you translate the markings?
  ans:
  - it's a slav dialect.

- que:
  - so, what should we say in terms of resale value?
  ans:
  - i am not interested in the resale.

- que:
  - we turn a profit, do we not?
  ans:
  - i will keep what i wish.

- que:
  - will you be needing anything?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - why not, solina?
  ans:
  - one reason.

  - what about artwork or diamonds or gold?
  ans:
  - fucking crucifixes and coffee cups.

- que:
  - you really sure we want to do do this?
  ans:
  - if it's worth locking, it's worth taking.

- que:
  - what... the hell is that?
  ans:
  - she said money.

- que:
  - fucking thousand year old silverware?
  ans:
  - probably got his goddamn mother in that thing.

- que:
  - if you make a killing, why hide it in a safe...
  ans:
  - marcus?

- que:
  - this look like an old wood box to you guys?
  ans:
  - the holy grail, the golden fleece... the crown fucking jewels, whatever it is, it's inside.

- que:
  - right.
  ans:
  - you want to get paid?

- que:
  - why do you build this?
  ans:
  - all right, you guys.

- que:
  - i just won't let it get to me.
  ans:
  - what are you looking at?

- que:
  - so, what do you think it is?
  ans:
  - you tell me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - we were robbed, simon.

- que:
  - what did they take?
  ans:
  - my private holdings.

- que:
  - why aren't they all over?
  ans:
  - there's no need to inform the police.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - well, i must tend to this matter myself.

- que:
  - matthew, what did they take?
  ans:
  - matthew.

- que:

  ans:
  - just sit down.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - oh, man.

- que:
  - shade?
  ans:
  - shade, quit fucking around.

- que:
  - shade, you back there?
  ans:
  - it was probably just turbulence.

- que:

  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:

  ans:
  - uhh.

- que:
  - mary?
  ans:
  - mary, wake up.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - mary.

- que:
  - why are you asking me this?
  ans:
  - she was afraid of something.

- que:
  - do i have some terrible secret?
  ans:
  - her confession would've been confidential.

- que:
  - remember?
  ans:
  - we went to school together.

- que:
  - the tits?
  ans:
  - it's the talent that matters, val.

- que:
  - i screwed up, didn't i?
  ans:
  - didn't even notice.

- que:
  - now we lost the sun, didn't we?
  ans:
  - i have to go out.

- que:

- que:
  - oh, mr. van helsing, haven't you been selfish?
  ans:
  - jesus.

- que:
  - who the hell was that?
  ans:
  - he meant to kill us.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - that was solina.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - shoot it in the heart or cut off its head.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - they are the undead.

- que:
  - i'm an atheist.
  ans:
  - the undead?

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - god loves you anyway.

- que:
  - oh, ah... you know why you never had me, simon?
  ans:
  - finish her, simon.

- que:
  - they are nosferatu vampires.
  ans:
  - won't you have a lot to explain?

- que:
  - and you're all right with this?
  ans:
  - i had them destroyed, eradicated... all but one my secret in the abbey.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - dracula... not myth... no ravings of a mad irish novelist.

- que:
  - what do you mean, can't?
  ans:
  - for each act that destroys a vampire... he survives.

- que:
  - he is, quite simply... beyond the reach of death, but why?
  ans:
  - that is the question that has plagued me... for over a century.

- que:
  - who is this creature that walks as a man... yet casts no reflection?
  ans:
  - i made a promise a long time ago... that if dracula could not die, then nor would i.

- que:
  - matthew, abraham, whoever you are... what else have you never told me?
  ans:
  - for the first time, i believe... that there is someone else in the world like him... and he senses it.

- que:
  - how did you feel?
  ans:
  - scared, but a little bit drawn.

- que:
  - do you have a sense of that?
  ans:
  - he wants me.

- que:
  - do you understand me, mary?
  ans:
  - you've got to fight back.

- que:
  - well, what if i can't?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - now, how does one become a vampire, solina?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how does one become a lover?
  ans:
  - well, i don't know.

- que:
  - whoa.
  ans:
  - you see that?

- que:
  - can i help you?
  ans:
  - i'm here for mary.

- que:
  - mary?
  ans:
  - she's...

- que:
  - mare?
  ans:
  - no luck.

- que:
  - you want to come in?
  ans:
  - you can wait.

- que:
  - oh, what's the word?
  ans:
  - catholic.

- que:
  - hey, can i get you some coffee or something?
  ans:
  - i don't drink... coffee.

- que:
  - why don't you make yourself comfortable?
  ans:
  - i'll be right back down.

- que:
  - yes, lucy?
  ans:
  - i was named after the peanuts character.

- que:
  - have you seen her?
  ans:
  - she cut out early.

- que:
  - problem?
  ans:
  - oh, no problem.

- que:
  - mary heller?
  ans:
  - my name's simon sheppard.

- que:
  - is there somewhere we could speak?
  ans:
  - my father and i have not had contact in over 12 years.

- que:
  - she never told you the reason, did she?
  ans:
  - i saw what it did to her.

- que:
  - buy a brother a drink?
  ans:
  - sorry, mate.

- que:
  - never, ever fuck with an antiques dealer.
  ans:
  - how's this for a concept?

- que:
  - mary?
  ans:
  - if you harm my daughter...

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - hey, mare.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - i'm with your father.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - ahh...

- que:
  - father?
  ans:
  - my unholy addiction has corrupted mary's blood...

- que:
  - you knew about this?
  ans:
  - not until tonight.

- que:
  - so, what now, simon?
  ans:
  - we need a sacred place.

- que:
  - it's what all this is about, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i'm his.

- que:
  - why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - well, let's just say...

- que:
  - fate?
  ans:
  - your father kept us all safe from this evil... for a hundred years.

- que:
  - father kept him locked up in some kind of dungeon?
  ans:
  - he tried to keep him from the world, mary... but most of all, he tried to keep him from you.

- que:
  - why silver?
  ans:
  - it's not uniquely christian.

- que:
  - is that hebrew?
  ans:
  - aramaic.

- que:
  - aramaic?
  ans:
  - that's been a dead language for almost 2, 000 years.

- que:
  - you know aramaic?
  ans:
  - no, but he does.

- que:
  - simon?
  ans:
  - mary's his.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i can't die.

- que:
  - he still loves you.
  ans:
  - did you ever ask?

- que:
  - how fast?
  ans:
  - 4:32.

- que:
  - or did your lips just slip?
  ans:
  - it's not that i didn't like it but i don't know what to think anymore.

- que:
  - is it clearer now?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - how many are there?
  ans:
  - pizza cops.

- que:
  - oil?
  ans:
  - yeah, it's my apartment but it's also kind of a garage.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - we've known each other for two years now.

- que:
  - why did you wait until the day you quit to show me your apartment?
  ans:
  - i take a long time to decide.

- que:
  - and what made you decide?
  ans:
  - your cleavage.

- que:
  - it's nice, eh?
  ans:
  - the dress is brand new.

- que:
  - are you sure it's okay after all these years of friendship?
  ans:
  - we prepared the ground well, it's time to build on it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's 6 o'clock.

- que:
  - you just stopped working last night, you didn't find a job during the night, did you?
  ans:
  - no, it's for my future job...... a kind of meeting i booked a long time ago.

- que:
  - how long have you been a driver?
  ans:
  - 25 years yesterday.

- que:
  - that's all?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you want me to sing the national anthem?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i use super unleaded.

- que:
  - still wearing the moustache!?
  ans:
  - go, paulo.

- que:
  - hey girls, going to the beach?
  ans:
  - today it's free.

- que:
  - coming?
  ans:
  - the driver is really nice.

- que:
  - you see the pink house over there, with a big door?
  ans:
  - yes, i see it.

- que:
  - do you prefer a route in particular?
  ans:
  - put all that in the kitchen, i'll organise it later.

- que:
  - he eats all that in one meal?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - can't you tell right from left?
  ans:

  ans:
  - oh yeah?

  - i think you're quite...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - welcome to deadwood.
  ans:
  - is it any wonder that i couldn't face reality?

- que:
  - is she allowed to say that?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - have you ever seen sidarthur in person?
  ans:
  - no, but i think stu wolff is the greatest poet since shakespeare.

- que:
  - my father is stu wolff's lawyer.
  ans:
  - you do?

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - your dad must have been in the same room as him and everything.

- que:
  - aren't you the girl who just moved into the swenska house?
  ans:
  - well, i'm lola steppe.

- que:
  - is that supposed to be that famous new york sense of humor?
  ans:
  - new yorkers learn to laugh at themselves and everything else when they're very young.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - we have a new girl from new york city.

- que:
  - she doesn't really have your potential, now, does she?
  ans:
  - look at her.

- que:
  - and what about those glasses?
  ans:
  - oh, no, that's fine.

- que:
  - so what's with the great santini?
  ans:
  - she's beautiful.

- que:
  - who's that guy smiling at us?
  ans:
  - that's sam.

- que:
  - it's your first day here, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why doesn't your mother like me?
  ans:
  - she likes you.

- que:
  - not important?
  ans:
  - she's the woman who gave me life.

- que:
  - ironic, isn't it?
  ans:
  - your parents think my mother is the destroyer of our social order.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - not stick to the exquisite words of mr. george bernard shaw?
  ans:
  - we're not english, and this isn't the 19th century, so i think we should adapt the classics to reflect our times.

- que:
  - you're gonna be playing eliza?
  ans:
  - well, of course.

- que:
  - that's gonna give the play new resonance and immediacy for today.
  ans:
  - was carla santini going to stand in the way of that birth?

- que:
  - you mean it was your idea?
  ans:
  - yes, lola, it's my idea.

- que:
  - then how are we to proceed?
  ans:
  - i guess i'll try, of course.

- que:
  - why had i been so certain i was going to get the lead?
  ans:
  - miss baggoli didn't say anything encouraging.

- que:
  - is that a threat?
  ans:
  - you heard it here first.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i can't breathe.

- que:
  - can you believe this?
  ans:
  - one of the most catastrophic events in the history of the universe has occurred, and everyone's acting as if nothing has happened.

- que:
  - so, who's next?
  ans:
  - me.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - carla's the all time champion.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - there's gonna be a new all time champion.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - what he told me isn't available to the public yet.

- que:
  - and guess who already has an invitation?
  ans:
  - it just so happens that ella and i do.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - yeah, really.

- que:
  - how'd you manage that?
  ans:
  - same way you did.

- que:
  - what connections do you have other than the phone?
  ans:
  - well, on whether we go.

- que:
  - in new york?
  ans:
  - and the party.

- que:
  - are you partially insane?
  ans:
  - you know, we have to go.

- que:
  - is there something wrong with the salmon?
  ans:
  - no, just not very hungry.

- que:
  - how can you treat me like this?
  ans:
  - i was your firstborn.

- que:
  - what did ella's mother say?
  ans:
  - she didn't ask her.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - om.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - okay, how about this?
  ans:
  - daddy drops you off at the concert and picks you up after.

- que:
  - is there no end to the humiliation you want to heap upon me, mom?
  ans:
  - we're heaping humiliation.

- que:
  - is mary going to die?
  ans:
  - she's not gonna die.

- que:
  - what is that smell?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - can't you take it away next month or september?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so, did you get yours yet?
  ans:
  - actually, mine came in the mail yesterday, but i'm nice enough not to flaunt them.

- que:
  - why don't you admit you don't have tickets or an invite and get it over with?
  ans:
  - i'm sure there's gonna be a lot of photographers there.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i guess.

- que:
  - you sure we have enough?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - so, do you think you could look absolutely perfect in something that you already own?
  ans:
  - sure, i'll try and find something.

- que:
  - yeah, they love us, right?
  ans:
  - they really love us.

- que:
  - wait here one second, okay?
  ans:
  - don't cry.

- que:
  - you must see these sidarthur people?
  ans:
  - it's their last performance.

- que:
  - well, why didn't you just ask, pumpkin?
  ans:
  - i didn't know i could.

- que:
  - i mean, what does one wear to stu wolff's party?
  ans:
  - there's gonna be so many famous people there.

- que:
  - i know it's not like me to be unprofessional, but how can i concentrate when sam is risking his life for me?
  ans:
  - oof.

- que:
  - lola and carla, do you have to talk?
  ans:
  - that's odd.

- que:
  - why isn't this locked?
  ans:
  - oh, my goodness.

- que:
  - well, i have no idea, do l?
  ans:
  - you know, i just want to talk to you about my lines.

- que:
  - you don't know your lines?
  ans:
  - at this time, i don't even want to discuss this.

- que:
  - you know what i think?
  ans:
  - i've never really relaxed before.

- que:
  - trying?
  ans:
  - take a look under the hood.

- que:
  - are you kidding me?
  ans:
  - hurry, i don't want to miss the train.

- que:
  - you mean you asked if it was okay?
  ans:
  - borrowed it.

- que:
  - you take the money, okay?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - you have your tickets and your money?
  ans:
  - we have the money.

- que:
  - isn't there a stall or something?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - ella, it's not here.

- que:
  - when did you last see it?
  ans:
  - in the train.

- que:
  - you mean sneak in?
  ans:
  - sneaking would be beneath us, but i can't think of a better word for what we're about to do.

- que:
  - this is a little tricky, so just follow my lead, okay?
  ans:
  - i wonder what song they'll do.

- que:
  - can i have another look at your ticket, please?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - you can see him outside.

- que:
  - and miss the concert?
  ans:
  - yeah, i don't think so.

- que:
  - ella, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm going back to the hotel.

- que:
  - what if everyone gave up, ella?
  ans:
  - there'd be no america, no electricity, no tivo.

- que:
  - don't you want to see the look on carla's face when we show up at that party?
  ans:
  - yeah, i do.

- que:
  - where in soho?
  ans:
  - we don't even know where stu lives.

  - yeah, remember?
  ans:
  - he's been trouble all over the world.

- que:
  - would you please relax?
  ans:
  - i'd rather lose him than lose my life.

- que:
  - where do you think he's going?
  ans:
  - someplace great.

- que:
  - this for you is great?
  ans:
  - i'm getting really scared being out here all alone, lola.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - come with me.

- que:
  - do you believe how lucky we are?
  ans:
  - i almost hear them praying that we don't sit near them.

- que:
  - do you think anybody really knows who i am?
  ans:
  - i don't even know who i am.

- que:
  - do you think i have any real friends?
  ans:
  - we'll just have coffee.

- que:
  - is that too difficult?
  ans:
  - you two better keep him in line.

- que:
  - stu, do you have any cash on you?
  ans:
  - we sort of left ours on the train.

- que:
  - can you believe this?
  ans:
  - we're actually having coffee with stu wolff.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - the fates have sort of brought us together.

- que:
  - ella what?
  ans:
  - ella gerard.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - lola steppe.

- que:
  - why did you lie like that to the police?
  ans:
  - they're gonna find out that your father is dead.

- que:
  - i'm resigned to what life may bring, but why did you give a false address?
  ans:
  - you know, ella, i think your true soul and spirit are finally beginning to emerge.

- que:
  - why did you lie?
  ans:
  - i didn't lie.

- que:
  - a little?
  ans:
  - exaggerating a little is saying you're a little taller.

- que:
  - can we talk about this later?
  ans:
  - we should tell stu what happened first.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - i had a reason.

- que:
  - the truth?
  ans:
  - just give me a moment.

- que:
  - more interesting?
  ans:
  - we are 1, 000 miles from home in a new york police station with a drunken rock star waiting for your dead father to show up.

- que:
  - more interesting than what?
  ans:
  - you know, you just don't understand.

- que:
  - ella, come on.

  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - can i have your autograph?

- que:
  - right, well, now that that's settled, would anyone like to come to a party with me?
  ans:
  - i would.

- que:
  - forgive me, please?
  ans:
  - i am in no way ready to forgive you.

- que:
  - don't you want to enjoy it?
  ans:
  - i'm not really in a partying mood.

- que:
  - why are you still out here?
  ans:
  - we just don't feel like going in right now.

  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - am i right?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because, mr. wolff, you're a drunk.

- que:
  - did you have fun?
  ans:
  - well, if it isn't the great pretender.

- que:
  - why would we want to hear what you have to say?
  ans:
  - ella and i were there.

- que:
  - did you hear that?
  ans:
  - she said they were there.

- que:
  - what dad?
  ans:
  - you don't have a dad.

- que:
  - do you think because we're not from new york that we're stupid?
  ans:
  - you saw us there.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i had to wear it to the sidarthur party.

- que:

  ans:
  - i sunk into a depression that only hamlet would recognize.

  - why?
  ans:
  - because i don't like it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's a farm auction, ladies.

- que:
  - what's going to happen to the cow who lived there?
  ans:
  - she'll be ok.

- que:
  - this was your farm?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - alameda slim happened.

- que:
  - mmm?
  ans:
  - ohh...

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - just ignore them, and perhaps they'll go away.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - look, lover bull, we're here strictly on business.

- que:
  - what kind of business?
  ans:
  - we're looking for a cattle rustler named alameda slim.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - it must be slim and the willies.

- que:
  - slim and the willies?
  ans:
  - i'll protect you.

- que:
  - with what?
  ans:
  - howdy, slim.

- que:
  - you boys see anything before i got here?
  ans:
  - yeah, we sure did there, rico.

- que:
  - you guys ok?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - singing?
  ans:
  - that didn't sound like singing to me.

- que:
  - you boys headed back to town?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - machine?
  ans:
  - well, there it is, then.

- que:
  - hey, watch it.
  ans:
  - why don't i?

- que:
  - where are you going, hotfoot?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna go nab that rustler... and show rico i got what it takes... so say good bye to your farm, girls, because slim is mine.

- que:
  - how can we compete with that?
  ans:
  - look at the bright side, mrs. c.

- que:
  - who better to catch a cattle thief than a cow?
  ans:
  - yeah, even you can't argue with that kind of logic.

- que:
  - how about a song?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna get you for this.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - big mike donald had a farm?
  ans:
  - put up your dukes, mr. fancy britches.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - this here is the disguise i use... to sneak into all them auctions... and buy all the land, you brainless monotone monkeys.

- que:
  - my singing?
  ans:
  - songbirds sing.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - why, it's one of the funniest, cornball, goofy, silly sounds... in the whole west.

- que:
  - but it's just a little old dirt farm.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - ah, what's the difference?
  ans:
  - when you're talking revenge, every last acre counts.

- que:
  - daddy, what's going to happen if they don't come back?
  ans:
  - oh, but they are coming back.

- que:
  - it doesn't take a cow to figure out... they saw the writing on the wall... and flown the coop while the getting was good.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - excuse me!
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - audrey, remember when grace helped you figure out... why you crossed the road?
  ans:
  - and, jeb, miss caloway knew just what to do... when your head got stuck in that spittoon.

- que:
  - what trail?
  ans:
  - i can't see anything.

- que:
  - but what about catching slim and collecting the reward?
  ans:
  - we never had a prayer... of catching slim in the first place.

- que:
  - what's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - strutting around with your vulgar show cow behavior.

- que:
  - will the sun ever shine again?
  ans:
  - mmm...

- que:
  - where will you go?
  ans:
  - oh, probably check out the grand canyon.

- que:
  - where's grace?
  ans:
  - hi, there.

- que:
  - where did all this come from?
  ans:
  - hey, it's green, it's leafy, and it's free.

- que:
  - now, where was i?
  ans:
  - without a doubt.

- que:
  - maggie, what are you thinking?
  ans:
  - look, i got a score to settle with that rhinestone fat boy... and nothing to lose.

- que:
  - deal?
  ans:
  - your powers of persuasion are uncanny.

- que:
  - can't you stupid sack of hammers get it right?
  ans:
  - oh, the ever punctual mr. weaseley.

- que:
  - so, slim, what do you say we get a move on... and load these cash cows onto the train a. s. a. p., huh?
  ans:
  - let's go.

- que:
  - how come they got to go through?
  ans:
  - buck...

- que:
  - so what's the plan?
  ans:
  - well, let's see...

  ans:
  - maybe she wasn't an art lover.

- que:
  - mother of mercy.
  ans:
  - huh?

- que:
  - is this the end of rico?
  ans:
  - uh... ha...

- que:
  - the whole territory belongs to me.
  ans:

  ans:
  - five cents for these chicks.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - where's maggie?
  ans:
  - i can't believe she just left.

- que:
  - she risked her life for us, and who are we but strangers?
  ans:
  - we were privileged to know her.

- que:
  - well, it's your call, caloway.
  ans:
  - how about forever?

- que:
  - is this barnyard big enough for the both of us?
  ans:
  - full house.

- que:
  - sure you don't want me to wait?
  ans:
  - no, thanks.

  ans:
  - that was not part of the date.

- que:
  - how could they order you to go?
  ans:
  - they didn't order me.

- que:
  - and now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go?
  ans:
  - it's not your responsibility, not your choice.

- que:
  - you analysts got it all figured out, don't you?
  ans:
  - the smart enemy hits you... exactly where you think you're safe.

  ans:
  - well, it's what i would do.

  - life is good, ain't it, danny?
  ans:
  - you know, you're a rotten drunk.

- que:
  - oh, i have to get used to it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - captain low, mr. president.

- que:
  - and where is god in all this?
  ans:

  - get rid of it.

- que:
  - taking army bombers off navy carriers?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - well, sir, is it even possible to land... a b 25 on an aircraft carrier deck?
  ans:
  - that won't matter.

- que:
  - but without them, where do we land?
  ans:
  - i have a phrase i want you to memorize.

- que:
  - fellas?
  ans:
  - sir.

- que:
  - what are they?
  ans:
  - friendship medals the japanese gave us... when they were pretending to want peace.

- que:
  - what'll you do with them?
  ans:
  - wire them to the bombs and give them back.

- que:
  - so what's going on?
  ans:
  - well, sir, we only have sixteen planes.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - when the japs hit us, they had more than 300.

- que:
  - how much difference can we make?
  ans:
  - it's not that we're afraid, sir.

- que:
  - colonel?
  ans:
  - i need a minute.

- que:
  - do you remember me?
  ans:
  - oh, sure i do.

- que:
  - how the hell do you know about this mission?
  ans:
  - let's call it an inadvertent disclosure.

- que:
  - you know how i know?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what if the beacons are switched off?
  ans:
  - bring her down any way you can... and do your best to avoid capture.

- que:
  - what if we have to bail out over japan?
  ans:
  - well, in that situation, i can't tell you what to do.

- que:
  - what would you do, colonel?
  ans:
  - i wasn't built to be a prisoner... so i would have my crew bail out.

- que:
  - how many yards?
  ans:
  - 400 yards and closing, sir.

- que:
  - how far are we?
  ans:
  - colonel, i don't know if the planes... can carry enough fuel to make it to china.

- que:
  - what are you doing to my plane?
  ans:
  - tell your crew to take a piss before they take off.

- que:
  - danny, be careful, you hear me?
  ans:
  - i will.

- que:
  - are you nervous?
  ans:
  - no yes, sir.

- que:
  - when did you find religion?
  ans:
  - when you assigned me to this mission, sir.

- que:
  - what's that, colonel?
  ans:
  - pray for both of us.

- que:
  - thank you, george.
  ans:
  - ripley, you gota target in sight?

- que:
  - what is it, general?
  ans:
  - colonel doolittle had to advance his execution order... by twelve hours, mr. president.

- que:
  - is this all you got?
  ans:
  - that's all we got, red.

- que:
  - how about now?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - where's gooz?
  ans:
  - he's fine.

- que:
  - can you have someone else write my name on the tombstone?
  ans:
  - danny.

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:
  - you're gonna be a daddy.

- que:
  - the times tried our souls... and through the trial, we overcame.
  ans:
  - danny?

- que:
  - hey, danny... how'd you like to go flying?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - what destiny, to live like a crab in a shell?
  ans:
  - we live well.

- que:
  - but how can we, when every harbor is an enemy's?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm sick of your crazy dreams.

- que:
  - ... but to excel at swordplay and boxing?
  ans:
  - yes, sire.

- que:
  - do the gods approve the day and the hour?
  ans:
  - the omens are good and also the prophecies, with but one exception.

- que:
  - how can i, mother?
  ans:
  - oh, i wish it hadn't been given me...... this agony i live with.

- que:
  - elysium?
  ans:
  - far from it.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - oh, just a quickening of the breeze.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - some ship had bad luck.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the fairest goddess.

- que:
  - what was your ship?
  ans:
  - cover him up, quickly.

- que:
  - yes.
  ans:
  - a man, my lady?

- que:
  - what if he's a warrior and only pretending?
  ans:
  - you must be careful.

- que:
  - to whom am i indebted for this gallant defense?
  ans:
  - nobody of importance.

- que:
  - did i mention that?
  ans:
  - my memory is clouded.

- que:
  - you're addressing a slave of the palace, andros.
  ans:
  - you're a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are, a slave?

- que:
  - of what importance is that?
  ans:
  - i tell you truly, i am prince paris.

- que:
  - and why should that worry you?
  ans:
  - never mind.

- que:
  - do you know her?
  ans:
  - she owns me.

- que:
  - not even the king?
  ans:
  - great power doesn't need knowledge.

- que:
  - so you still hope i won't go to the palace?
  ans:
  - more than ever.

- que:
  - when will they be in council?
  ans:
  - tomorrow, perhaps.

- que:
  - see what i brought you?
  ans:
  - my dear little slave girl...... i don't want what you steal from the palace.

- que:
  - don't you believe i could love a slave?
  ans:
  - yes, i believe.

- que:
  - are you sure ulysses is coming?
  ans:
  - his ship was not far behind mine.

- que:
  - paris is anyone's equal with a cestus, bow and javelin.
  ans:
  - you think the trojans built a citadel for peace lovers?

- que:
  - you believe they want peace?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - lead us, achilles?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - i, ajax.

- que:
  - you are king menelaus?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how'd you know we were here?
  ans:
  - i beg my lord's indulgence, i know.

- que:
  - troy does not plan war?
  ans:
  - you are wrong, menelaus.

- que:
  - where'd you find this impostor?
  ans:
  - he came to the palace.

- que:
  - what do you do besides this royal imposture?
  ans:
  - it seems i try to do the impossible.

- que:
  - you heard, ajax, achilles?
  ans:
  - achilles is weary from travel.

- que:
  - if i come fairly out of this fight, will you believe that i am paris...... and hear the trojan peace terms?
  ans:
  - if your head's still on your shoulders, yes.

- que:
  - to study our arts and culture?
  ans:
  - the man can neither speak nor hear.

- que:
  - what did you think of the trojan?
  ans:
  - you saw what i thought.

- que:
  - what is this game you're playing?
  ans:
  - i might do many things with him.

- que:
  - why did you marry him?
  ans:
  - when a king takes spoils, he robs no one.

- que:
  - the queen's handmaiden, eh?
  ans:
  - the king commands me to entertain his guests.

- que:
  - a fine greek custom, but guest?
  ans:
  - he's in a prison, if he only knew it.

- que:
  - must king menelaus command you himself to admit me?
  ans:
  - the royal temper's already running a fever.

- que:
  - shall i tell the king you said that?
  ans:
  - get to your business, you little troublemaker.

- que:
  - those two soldiers on watch down there...... are they going to help me too?
  ans:
  - you're a captive.

- que:
  - then what chance have i?
  ans:
  - a cup of wine.

- que:
  - does he think the man will swim?
  ans:
  - he'd be deep in the forest by now.

- que:
  - why do you wait?
  ans:
  - it was just a foolish hope.

- que:
  - here?
  ans:
  - she sent you garments...... arranged for a phoenician ship to take you home.

- que:
  - what more, trojan?
  ans:
  - i didn't really expect her to come.

- que:
  - you made clear to adelphus what i said?
  ans:
  - he is far off by this time.

- que:
  - and destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and always young, paris, remember?
  ans:
  - what is remembered is forever young.

- que:
  - ulysses, why do you sit?
  ans:
  - menelaus, we will reclaim her, and with her, all the loot of troy.

- que:
  - leader?
  ans:
  - i'll see no one but achilles as leader.

- que:
  - who are they?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but i know the color of their gold.

- que:
  - what will they call us there?
  ans:
  - a woman who left her husband.

- que:
  - what else can we ever be?
  ans:
  - two people in love.

- que:
  - you know the island of pelagos?
  ans:
  - it's far southward...

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - we have decided otherwise.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - you'll have to see, lord aeneas.

- que:
  - how could one so tender have managed it?
  ans:
  - postpone your questions.

- que:
  - by what name, my lady, shall we know you?
  ans:
  - my name is her name is death.

- que:
  - you were going to say?
  ans:
  - i am helen, queen of sparta.

- que:
  - the wife of king menelaus?
  ans:
  - his wife no more.

- que:
  - and what have you brought?
  ans:
  - dishonor.

- que:
  - you reject every word of wisdom?
  ans:
  - my love has no logic.

- que:
  - the coward's way to avoid the fight?
  ans:
  - you exceed the rights of a brother.

- que:
  - pelagos?
  ans:
  - go home and search your hearts, trojans...... for all this must be answered soon.

- que:
  - without you?
  ans:
  - i've gained a victory of a sort tonight.

- que:
  - here?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, even here.

- que:
  - what shall we pay?
  ans:
  - aeneas, bring them here.

- que:
  - see what you have brought upon us?
  ans:
  - father.

- que:
  - hector, where is my place?
  ans:
  - beside your spartan woman.

- que:
  - no trojans to greet us?
  ans:
  - i had hoped they'd be foolish enough to scatter their forces.

- que:
  - camp?
  ans:
  - no, onwards.

- que:
  - against troy's walls, achilles?
  ans:
  - she's mine.

- que:
  - the girl you fell in love with?
  ans:
  - always keep that image with you, paris.

- que:
  - then it can't be lost, can it?
  ans:
  - what has been lived and shared is never lost.

- que:
  - but if you should lose me...... could you resign yourself to that?
  ans:
  - don't worry, nothing will happen to you.

- que:
  - to our island, paris?
  ans:
  - oh, goddess come to earth, make me immortal with your kiss...... and we'll live on nectar and ambrosia.

- que:
  - how many years, fellow trojans, shall we suffer?
  ans:
  - our only respite, a truce to burn our dead.

- que:
  - how long will they accuse me?
  ans:
  - they lost many loved ones, my lady.

- que:
  - how, then, could i blame you for this war?
  ans:
  - i could stop it.

- que:
  - go back to someone you so despise?
  ans:
  - if it brings an end to war and restores paris to the love of the trojans....

- que:
  - and could i ever leave him?
  ans:
  - you must help me to decide.

- que:
  - would you defy the fates?
  ans:
  - no mortal should attempt so much, helen.

- que:
  - lovely?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you hear that, brother?
  ans:
  - i've heard it often.

- que:
  - with helen returned, integrity satisfied?
  ans:
  - you are too outspoken, brother.

- que:
  - helen?
  ans:
  - helen.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - she's not here, paris.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - she's gone to the camp of the greeks.

- que:
  - to menelaus?
  ans:
  - she was determined to end the destruction...... and restore you to the hearts of the trojans.

- que:
  - debt?
  ans:
  - we recognize no claim of debt.

- que:
  - then who pays for the greek blood shed on this plain?
  ans:

- que:
  - what say you, my brother?

- que:
  - but it is possible to love them.
  ans:
  - have you been bouncing?

- que:
  - paris?
  ans:
  - father asked to see you.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because he wants you to take a message to the new king menelaus, younger brother of high king agamemnon of mycenae.

- que:
  - some sort of supreme ruler, is he?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because we control access to the silks and spices of byzantium.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i just can't believe people go to war over nutmeg.

- que:
  - where is he now, this high king of theirs?
  ans:
  - don't know.

- que:
  - am i close?
  ans:
  - you're being a fool.

- que:
  - why aren't you fighting now?
  ans:
  - i've caused such grief and destruction.

- que:
  - why do you have to do this?
  ans:
  - menelaus commands it.

- que:
  - how can you let them treat you like this?
  ans:
  - they can look all they want, but they'll never see me.

- que:
  - to whom is it addressed?
  ans:
  - do not shame me, brother.

- que:
  - how can you say that?
  ans:
  - when i'm there with them, i feel nothing.

- que:
  - what's happened to you?
  ans:
  - i've become visible.

- que:
  - what's going to happen?
  ans:
  - i heard agamemnon and menelaus talk of troy.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - tomorrow they will ask the envoy about his city.

- que:
  - why is he here?
  ans:
  - that makes no matter.

- que:
  - did he come bearing tribute?
  ans:
  - there is no tribute that compares with you.

- que:
  - you mean stealing's not a crime in sparta?
  ans:
  - being caught is the crime, always.

- que:
  - is this really true?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - iphigenia, where are you?
  ans:
  - my wife tells me... that no man can claim the world.

- que:
  - what say the gods?
  ans:
  - olympus favors the high king... who one day will rule the entire aegean.

- que:
  - the greeks have other ideas.
  ans:
  - is that understood?

- que:
  - what sort of ideas?
  ans:
  - like cut off our heads, put them on pikes, let birds eat our eyes.

- que:
  - without you?
  ans:
  - you have my love.

- que:
  - what makes you think the kings will unite behind you?
  ans:
  - the gods have written it.

- que:
  - my lord.
  ans:

  - really?
  ans:
  - hiert's online all day long.

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you have a number for him?
  ans:
  - yeah, definitely.

- que:

  - you weren't in restil's home, with the jukt executives?
  ans:
  - no, i didn't mean to imply that i had been.

- que:
  - did the fax come through okay?
  ans:
  - yes, it did.

- que:
  - you want to read it back to me?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - i'm sorry?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - why would a major software company put their website where only aol members can access it, as opposed to the entire web?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - how so?
  ans:
  - quite frankly, it doesn't look like a real website.

- que:
  - could somebody do that?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - do you still want that number for jim ghort?
  ans:
  - i found it in my notes.

- que:
  - sorry?

  - lf you like.

- que:
  - i mean, why didn't you back me up?
  ans:
  - i mean, i'm the editor.

- que:
  - just editor to editor?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - completely off the record, and really almost human being to human being?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - so given everything that's happened, how strongly are you going to stand behind the story?
  ans:
  - i'm looking into it.

- que:
  - what about?
  ans:
  - let's do it in private.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - these forbes guys want to come down on you.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:

  - i can back them off for a day or two, okay?
  ans:
  - okay.

  - here?
  ans:
  - yeah, they moved in and out.

- que:
  - excuse me sir, can i help you?
  ans:
  - yes, you can.

- que:

  ans:
  - yes, we're sure.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - building's closed on sunday.

- que:
  - that's why the restils only stayed a few minutes, okay?
  ans:
  - because it was such a dumb place to squeeze into.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - people at the dinner.

- que:
  - how many?
  ans:
  - about 10, i think, including me.

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - for dinner?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - but it was a couple of minutes before 3:00, and lan looked like he was about ready to cry, and so they said okay.

- que:
  - but for dinner?
  ans:
  - go in and ask them yourself, chuck.

- que:
  - i'm sorry i yelled at you back there.
  ans:
  - you're supposed to support me, and you're taking their word against mine?

- que:
  - okay.
  ans:
  - chuck?

- que:
  - you weren't at the conference?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - and i wanted the piece to have an eyewitness feel to it, for color so...

- que:
  - and everything we just told the forbes guys?
  ans:
  - i'm so sorry, chuck.

- que:
  - can you do that?
  ans:
  - there might be facets of this that you're not considering.

- que:
  - why are you defending him?
  ans:
  - nobody's defending him, chuck.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - he sat down, and he hand wrote a bunch of phony quotes and handed them in as source material for the fact check.

- que:
  - doesn't that offend you?
  ans:
  - of course it does.

- que:
  - how's he doing?
  ans:
  - well, he's a wreck, of course.

- que:
  - so...?
  ans:
  - obviously he needs some help.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i'm so dead.

- que:
  - nobody's ever going to hire me again, are they?
  ans:
  - l was so sloppy, trusting my sources like that.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - a couple of times,

- que:
  - now who's going to hire me?
  ans:
  - steve, i have to ask you something.

- que:
  - was that true?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - ls there a problem?
  ans:
  - well, i don't know.

- que:
  - david, what is the problem?
  ans:
  - he asked me if i would drive him out to dulles later tonight.

- que:
  - did he say where he was going?
  ans:
  - yeah, he said he'd be staying with his family for a while.

- que:
  - his parents live in highland park, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i'm sorry?
  ans:
  - his brother, at stanford.

  ans:
  - for just a day.

- que:
  - you can understand that, can't you?
  ans:
  - you're fired, steve.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're fired.

- que:
  - chuck... will you please take me to the airport?
  ans:

- que:
  - you've always been a smart, thorough reporter.

  - would you take his word for it?

- que:
  - why can't you be one now?
  ans:
  - because what you're telling me is impossible, chuck.

- que:
  - and make me chicken fingers?
  ans:
  - me.

- que:
  - and give me a bath?
  ans:
  - me.

- que:

- que:
  - is aunt helen older than you, audrey?
  ans:
  - get farther down.

- que:
  - is she playing hide and go seek?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - aunt helen, can we go to the statue of liberty tomorrow?
  ans:
  - no, because we won't be here...

- que:
  - where's henry?
  ans:
  - he said he'd be right back.

- que:
  - i go to the bathroom for five seconds, and he's gone?
  ans:
  - with mustard.

- que:
  - you don't want mustard?
  ans:
  - aunt helen.

- que:
  - can you pay aaron, please?
  ans:
  - and we'll all go together.

- que:
  - where are we going to dinner?
  ans:
  - this is dinner.

- que:
  - sleepless sally gets really upset when the kids aren't going to sleep.
  ans:
  - how many beds do you have in your apartment, aunt helen?

- que:
  - sarah?
  ans:
  - this was great.

- que:
  - more time?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what about them?
  ans:
  - they've got school.

- que:
  - that's your plan, jenny.
  ans:
  - are you happy now?

- que:
  - all right, well, what about the idea of not selling lindsay's house?
  ans:
  - i know you guys offered to pay the mortgage, but it's enormous.

- que:
  - besides being my idea, what's wrong with moving down the block?
  ans:
  - i mean, i think the calm of the familiar is better than the overwhelming hustle bustle of the city.

- que:
  - guys, can you please keep the coloring on the eggs and not each other?
  ans:
  - oh, no, no, no.

- que:
  - why are you being a brat?
  ans:
  - you're a brat.

- que:
  - we need to help aunt helen.
  ans:
  - you know what?

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - that's the girl looking at 4b.

- que:
  - i'll put you on a waiting list if a two opens up.
  ans:
  - that's it?

- que:
  - and look at this flower power, huh?
  ans:
  - so i guess audrey can have the back room and henry and sarah can share the middle one and i'll just sleep on a pull out couch.

- que:
  - how does that work?
  ans:
  - when somebody buzzes, you stick your head out the window and you look down.

- que:
  - don't chew on the windowsills, all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so, it's not that bad, right, jen?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - hello.
  ans:
  - so i see you have kids too, so maybe a play date sometime?

- que:
  - can i ask you a special favor?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - these aren't her kids?
  ans:
  - our sister passed.

- que:
  - which they will, no?
  ans:
  - you could...

- que:
  - so, helen, where have you decided to send the kids to school?
  ans:
  - got it covered.

- que:
  - i mean, right, kids?
  ans:
  - hippo wants to be a lutheran, too.

- que:
  - i mean, isn't that right, father?
  ans:
  - pastor.

- que:
  - blood tests?
  ans:
  - make sure they're really lutheran.

- que:
  - why would i joke about hemophilia?
  ans:
  - there's no blood test.

- que:
  - shall we take a look around?
  ans:
  - so we have space available.

- que:
  - can you handle the tuition?
  ans:
  - not a problem.

- que:
  - pretty much the standard heaven, hell, purgatory thing?
  ans:
  - pretty much.

- que:

  ans:
  - no, i'm gonna go play tetherball.

- que:

  ans:
  - here, let me help you.

- que:

  ans:
  - let me help you.

- que:
  - what's the secret?
  ans:
  - it's a surprise.

  ans:
  - you're a rare challenge, mr. bond.

  ans:
  - now, look...

  - so where is this cutting edge stuff?
  ans:
  - i'm trying to get to it.

  ans:
  - she was right under your nose.

- que:

  ans:
  - now s good.

- que:
  - wasn t me.
  ans:
  - sir, what the hell was that?

- que:

  ans:
  - the exceptional flying of major john sheppard.

- que:
  - what say we cut to the part where you start talking real fast?
  ans:
  - ah, weir s in here.

- que:
  - in their flying city?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - flying city?
  ans:
  - well, uh, keep in mind this is the race that built the stargates they did everything big.

- que:
  - um who knows?
  ans:
  - we know the ancients on earth were suffering from a plague.

- que:
  - but isn t that reason enough to go?
  ans:
  - well i ve been choosing members for this expedition for months, dr.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the z. p. m. he s, uh, he s canadian.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - you re the one who fired that thing at me.

- que:
  - you mean the drone?
  ans:
  - the weapon the ancients built to defend this outpost.

- que:
  - you do have security clearance to be here?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, general o neill just gave it to me.

- que:
  - the what?
  ans:
  - jack, you know that gating to another galaxy requires an enormous amount of power.

- que:
  - you think there are more of these zed things in atlantis?
  ans:
  - i said don t touch anything.

- que:
  - did i do that?
  ans:
  - we could be on our way to discovering an entirely new ancient civilization.

- que:
  - oh, don t you have a dozen or so people already who can use the ancient technology?
  ans:
  - yeah, with concentration and training they can make it work.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - this isn t a long trip so i il be as succinct as possible.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - with all due respect, sir, we were just attacked by an alien missile.

- que:
  - why d you become a pilot?
  ans:
  - i think people that don t wanna fly are crazy.

- que:
  - does anyone else here speak the language these guy's are speaking?
  ans:
  - i just need a couple of minutes to finish my work, and you're not helping by standing there.

- que:
  - we there yet?
  ans:
  - we re just waiting on dr. mckay.

- que:
  - can i have everyone s attention please?
  ans:
  - all right, here we go.

- que:
  - that would be dr. weir, right?
  ans:
  - chevron three encoded.

- que:
  - what is it we re looking at?
  ans:
  - switching to zero locks.

- que:
  - it s structurally in tact?
  ans:
  - the climactic sensors say there s oxygen, no measurable toxins ; we have viable life support.

- que:
  - what does it feel like?
  ans:
  - hurts like hell, sir.

- que:
  - security teams, any alien contact?
  ans:
  - negative, sir.

- que:
  - can you come down and meet me please?
  ans:
  - we re three levels down, come in.

- que:
  - so it might really be the lost city of atlantis?
  ans:
  - not much. could travel between the stars, exchanging knowledge and friendship.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - that if we don t stop everything we re doing right now, we are dead.

- que:
  - what if it fails completely?
  ans:
  - it s a matter of when, not if.

- que:
  - all right, well how much time do we have?
  ans:
  - it s hard to say.

- que:
  - what about our own power generators?
  ans:
  - we re working on that, but with our most advanced naquada power generators, the equations are coming up far short.

- que:
  - well how do we do that if we can t search the city?
  ans:
  - if there were more here, we d be able to detect them.

- que:
  - can we use the stargate?
  ans:
  - there s nowhere near enough power to open a wormhole back to earth.

- que:
  - everything okay here, sheppard?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, just a couple of kids.

- que:
  - are you here to trade?
  ans:
  - trade, yes.

- que:
  - now how many times have i told you not to play in the forest after dark?
  ans:
  - i m just glad you re safe.

- que:
  - what was that mask you had on?
  ans:
  - helps you see in the dark, check it out.

- que:
  - this?
  ans:
  - the wraith.

- que:
  - can we go there?
  ans:
  - afraid not, i come from a galaxy far, far away.

- que:
  - is that a fact?
  ans:
  - well then, we il just uh, we il have to get to know each other.

- que:
  - will you join us?
  ans:
  - i love a good cup of tea.

- que:
  - who are these wraith?
  ans:
  - we have never met anyone who did not know.

- que:
  - what if the wraith are the enemy the ancient hologram lady is talking about?
  ans:
  - all the more reason for us to have a defensible position should we need to abandon atlantis.

- que:
  - do i?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - then there is something you should see.
  ans:
  - you truly cannot return to your world?

- que:
  - how much further is this place?
  ans:
  - not far.

- que:
  - what s this?
  ans:
  - i lost this years ago.

- que:
  - someone s been busy, huh?
  ans:
  - the drawings in the caves are extensive.

- que:
  - does this represent the destruction of your city?
  ans:
  - this drawing far predates that.

- que:
  - someone knew it was gonna happen?
  ans:
  - i believe it happens again, and again.

- que:
  - where the hell is he?
  ans:
  - they are not really there.

- que:
  - what am i looking for?
  ans:
  - there another part of the force field just failed.

- que:
  - the city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain these main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.
  ans:
  - how are we doing?

- que:
  - to save it for whom?
  ans:
  - survivors from the settlement ; we were attacked.

- que:
  - what s going on?
  ans:
  - we are in no position to help anyone right now.

- que:
  - what the hell s going on here?
  ans:
  - we were about to abandon the city.

- que:
  - jinto, you have any other address where we can gate to?
  ans:
  - yes, many.

- que:
  - so now could our naquada generators supply enough power to the shield for defensive purposes?
  ans:
  - not even close.

- que:
  - all right, just shut up and listen to me for a moment, all right?
  ans:
  - come on, what do we know about the wraith.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don t need to answer your question because the people in charge didn t consider the ramifications before they reacted.

- que:
  - how am i supposed to react?
  ans:
  - and we re defenseless, you said so yourself.

- que:
  - how do you know going off on some half assed rescue mission isn t going to bring them all right back here to our doorstep?
  ans:
  - maybe it will, but it s the right thing to do.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because it is.

- que:
  - do you know what that means?
  ans:
  - it s just a matter of time before the wraith figure out that this is the base of our operations.

- que:
  - we weren t there for more than a few hours before they showed up.
  ans:
  - i mean who knows?

- que:
  - and that one of these people you brought back here with you tipped them off?
  ans:
  - it s possible.

- que:
  - any idea what to expect?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how do i know he s not the one who told them?
  ans:
  - someone comes.

- que:
  - we re the ones you re after, right?
  ans:
  - i m their leader.

- que:
  - wait, what was that?
  ans:
  - rotate the camera.

- que:
  - you re sure this is the right address?
  ans:
  - it s the only one we could get a lock on.

- que:
  - dr. beckett, what was it you wanted me to see?
  ans:
  - these cells have none of the normal human inhibiting proteins whatsoever.

- que:
  - i say that anything he saw was caused by a residual command language in the severed nerve endings.
  ans:
  - what about the movement major sheppard saw?

- que:
  - very, very old.
  ans:
  - all right, anything else?

- que:
  - i don t blame ya.
  ans:
  - how old?

- que:
  - what is that noise?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - a little puddle jumper like this?
  ans:
  - it s a ship, it goes through the gate.

- que:
  - i thought we were going with gate ship?
  ans:
  - negative, flight.

- que:
  - did you do that?
  ans:
  - i was just wondering where we go from here.

- que:
  - so how do we find them once we land?
  ans:
  - well i ve been thinking about that too.

- que:
  - is my son alive?
  ans:
  - he s well and waiting for you.

- que:
  - where s colonel sumner?
  ans:
  - he was taken by the wraith.

- que:
  - how about when?
  ans:
  - not long.

- que:
  - how bout a diversion a little bit?
  ans:
  - we re gonna need to make some noise out there.

- que:
  - rig up the c4 to blow a hole and get these people out of here on my signal, all right?
  ans:
  - i can find the colonel with this, there aren t that many wraith around.

- que:
  - what do you call yourself?
  ans:
  - colonel marshall sumner, united states marine corps.

- que:
  - is it valor or ignorance?
  ans:
  - we traveled through the stargate as peaceful explorers.

- que:
  - feeding ground?
  ans:
  - all living things must eat.

- que:
  - why do you care?
  ans:
  - hunger is distasteful.

- que:
  - what do you call your world?
  ans:
  - earth.

- que:
  - more?
  ans:
  - our feeding ground has not been so rich in ten thousand years.

- que:
  - is that the kind of treatment i can expect for myself and my people?
  ans:
  - as i have said, all living things must eat.

- que:
  - where is this new feeding ground?
  ans:
  - i won t...

- que:
  - how s the hand feeling?
  ans:
  - much better.

- que:
  - how did this come to you?
  ans:
  - i don t remember.

- que:
  - how d you find me?
  ans:
  - tread marks, standard issue.

- que:
  - how many are left?
  ans:
  - sir, we need to leave.

- que:
  - colonel sumner?
  ans:
  - we are well enough.

- que:
  - what can we do?
  ans:
  - we re safe as long as they can t see us.

- que:
  - then how can we get through?
  ans:
  - we have to draw them away from the gate and double back.

- que:
  - you see anything like a weapons console over there?
  ans:
  - try and go invisible again.

- que:
  - do we have an identification code?
  ans:
  - nothing yet.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - look around you.

- que:
  - how come i never make friends like that?
  ans:
  - you need to get out more.

- que:
  - is there lemon in this?
  ans:
  - one more thing major.

- que:
  - well you are the ranking military officer now, or do you need to be reminded of that?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yes, i did.

- que:
  - what's she like?

- que:
  - can you tell us...
  ans:
  - what kind of sign?

- que:
  - how are we supposed to address the fhrer?
  ans:
  - heil, mein fhrer.

- que:
  - and the nazi salute?

  ans:

- que:
  - where did they come from?
  ans:
  - we don't know yet.

- que:
  - koller, do you know berlin is under artillery fire?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - can't you hear the shooting?
  ans:
  - no, i'm in wildpark werder.

- que:
  - are the russians that close?
  ans:
  - they should hang the entire luftwaffe leadership.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - you're married to the sister of eva braun.

  ans:
  - absolutely not.

  - look at that.

- que:
  - leaving already, gentlemen?
  ans:
  - i wanted to talk to you.

- que:
  - speer...... what do you think?
  ans:
  - you have to be on the stage when the curtain falls.

- que:
  - to play at war?
  ans:
  - go home.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i want my son.

- que:
  - at which front did you fight?
  ans:
  - i haven't had the honour yet.

- que:
  - which position?
  ans:
  - this is not a position, it's a trap.

- que:
  - what with?
  ans:
  - with the anti aircraft guns.

- que:
  - do you really think you'll last even five minutes?
  ans:
  - we promised the fhrer.

- que:
  - don't you understand?
  ans:
  - the war is lost.

- que:
  - using which units?
  ans:
  - steiner will attack from the north and join the 9th army.

- que:
  - do you doubt my orders?
  ans:
  - i think i've been clear enough.

- que:
  - with all due respect, what will happen to the women and children...... and the thousands of wounded and elderly?
  ans:
  - in a war such as this one, there are no civilians.

- que:
  - but why don't you tell him that?
  ans:
  - he doesn't listen to reason.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - he'll throw us out.

- que:
  - where were you?
  ans:
  - none of your business.

- que:
  - what will happen to us?
  ans:
  - i could go if i wanted to.

- que:
  - we can't all go, can we?
  ans:
  - i can't go either.

- que:
  - life will go on.
  ans:
  - life will go on.

- que:
  - what do you think, herr oberst?
  ans:
  - we have to go.

- que:
  - go where?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - if the war is lost, what does it matter that the people are lost too?
  ans:
  - the primary necessities of life of the german people aren't relevant, right now.

- que:
  - care to dance, frulein braun?
  ans:
  - i'd love to.

- que:
  - may i?
  ans:
  - go ahead.

- que:
  - what's wrong?

- que:
  - can somebody play some music?
  ans:
  - i want to dance.

- que:

  ans:
  - as long as it swings.

- que:
  - how so?
  ans:
  - i'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.

- que:
  - and, general?
  ans:
  - i'll be executed.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - they think i moved my command post to the west.

- que:
  - you're a doctor, aren't you?
  ans:
  - yes, an internist.

- que:
  - what about?
  ans:
  - i'm going to be executed.

- que:
  - why am i going to be executed?
  ans:
  - you know that any evasive manoeuvre towards the west is forbidden.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - my troops have been fighting for days.

- que:
  - do you see this?
  ans:
  - i don't want you to use that tone with me.

- que:
  - how should i know?
  ans:
  - i'm going to have a look.

- que:
  - see that?
  ans:
  - that's where the reich ends.

- que:
  - may i?
  ans:
  - he's damned stubborn.

- que:
  - why doesn't he let me do that?
  ans:
  - i should have been back by now.

- que:
  - are you sure the fhrer still needs me?
  ans:
  - drink.

- que:
  - but you don't think steiner will attack, do you?
  ans:
  - i doubt whether steiner is able to do anything...... but you probably know that better than i do.

- que:
  - is it german artillery that i hear?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid not.

- que:
  - but hasn't steiner's attack started?
  ans:
  - you have to go as fast as you can.

- que:
  - what does he have to lose?
  ans:
  - i don't believe a word of it.

- que:
  - is this what it came to?
  ans:
  - the military, everybody lied to me.

- que:
  - how can i be a leader under these circumstances?
  ans:
  - it's over.

- que:
  - the fhrer wasn't serious about killing himself, was he?
  ans:
  - frau junge, frau christian.

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - time to end this charade.

- que:
  - do you want us to stop fighting?
  ans:
  - that's inconceivable.

- que:
  - and then what?
  ans:
  - no capitulation.

- que:
  - what will happen to us?
  ans:
  - gnsche says there's a tunnel that goes under the russian lines.

- que:
  - why did you say you wanted to stay with him?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - where do they come from?
  ans:
  - volkssturm.

- que:
  - what is all this?
  ans:
  - a greifkommando.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - you have no authority here.

- que:
  - you maybe?
  ans:
  - stop it.

- que:
  - can you operate?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - can you look after them for a moment?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - brigade fhrer, what can i do for you?
  ans:
  - your volkssturm is an easy prey for the russians.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - i decided not to die in berlin.

- que:
  - does my sister know where you are?
  ans:
  - think about it.

- que:
  - do you remember the song?
  ans:
  - the best thing to do is to shoot yourself in the mouth.

- que:
  - can i have one too?
  ans:
  - me too.

- que:
  - any questions?
  ans:
  - no, mein fhrer.

- que:
  - ... do you agree that i take charge...... with complete freedom of action?
  ans:
  - if i receive no reply by 2200 hours...... i'll assume you have been incapacitated.

- que:
  - how dare he say i'm incapacitated?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - how did you get into berlin?
  ans:
  - it wasn't easy, but i must speak to the fhrer.

- que:
  - what did he turn that into?
  ans:
  - for that alone, he should be executed.

- que:
  - is there any hope left?
  ans:
  - frau junge, leave from here before it's too late.

- que:
  - we can't leave him behind, can we?
  ans:
  - he doesn't need anybody for what awaits him.

- que:
  - and go where?
  ans:
  - i can arrange for you to be taken to schwanenwerder by barge.

- que:
  - did he ever doubt that?
  ans:
  - lately, he often thought you were against him too.

- que:
  - has he gone insane?
  ans:
  - he must have told them i'm sick.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he's himmler's assistant.

- que:
  - do you think i'll sit and wait until those jewish swine slaughter me?
  ans:
  - this is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre.

- que:
  - you also request to leave berlin?
  ans:
  - mein fhrer, as you know, all medical departments...... that fall under the ss and himmler, have left berlin.

- que:
  - what, you can't find fegelein?
  ans:
  - keep searching.

- que:
  - ernst, is something wrong?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - gruppenfhrer, you're under arrest.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're suspected of desertion.

- que:
  - you can't have hermann executed, can you?
  ans:
  - there's no doubt.

- que:
  - what does it matter?
  ans:
  - everything's over.

- que:
  - what's the point of that?
  ans:
  - it is my wish.

- que:

- que:
  - all my brother does is jam crayons up his nose.
  ans:
  - inside the house?

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - stuart's just flying in the house.

- que:
  - flying in the house?
  ans:
  - i'm okay.

- que:
  - fine?
  ans:
  - stuart, you destroyed it.

- que:
  - why don't you take the boys home?
  ans:
  - i think stuart and i need to have a talk.

- que:
  - doesn't that make them kind of heavy?
  ans:
  - no, it's an expression, stuart.

- que:
  - then what?
  ans:
  - one step at a time.

- que:
  - tony, would you like to come over to my house this afternoon?
  ans:
  - sorry, pal.

- que:
  - can i come?
  ans:
  - my wing.

- que:
  - do we really want to antagonize him?
  ans:
  - oh, boy, we've got a problem.

- que:
  - so, who do i have to thank?
  ans:
  - forgive me.

- que:
  - are you an athlete?
  ans:
  - well, yeah.

- que:
  - hey, why don't we try your scarf?
  ans:
  - good idea.

- que:
  - how's that?
  ans:
  - that's much better, thank you.

- que:
  - so tell me, stuart little, do you actually live here?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - so, where do you live?
  ans:
  - you know, here and there.

- que:
  - you mean you don't have a home?
  ans:
  - once, we lived in a box.

- que:
  - i couldn't impose.
  ans:
  - a jewelry box?

- que:
  - i mean, you'd really do that for me?
  ans:
  - sure, i have just the thing.

- que:
  - you have a cat?
  ans:
  - that's a laugh.

- que:
  - hear that?
  ans:
  - that was a laugh.

- que:
  - are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - you can't just drag stray birds in here.

- que:
  - do you think this is a halfway house?
  ans:
  - look, she's filthy.

- que:
  - and how do you know she's not a vagrant or a thief?
  ans:
  - get rid of her.

- que:
  - what the heck was that?
  ans:
  - that's just how we greet each other.

- que:
  - found me?
  ans:
  - he saved my life.

- que:
  - he did?
  ans:
  - from a falcon.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.

- que:
  - a falcon?
  ans:
  - they are fierce creatures.

- que:
  - why does the city have falcons?
  ans:
  - that shouldn't be allowed.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - silver lining.

- que:
  - isn't it nice that stuart has a friend?
  ans:
  - i don't think stuart thinks of her as a friend.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i mean he's smitten.

- que:
  - frederick, did you have many crushes?
  ans:
  - i'm still having one.

- que:
  - pop you a tart?
  ans:
  - stuart, i'm full.

- que:
  - full?
  ans:
  - you eat like a bird.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - see, my mom just kind of one day...... wasn't there anymore.

- que:
  - so you've been completely on your own all your life?
  ans:
  - you bet.

- que:
  - can i bring you anything?
  ans:
  - no, thanks.

- que:
  - remember me?
  ans:
  - you scared me.

- que:
  - what can i say?
  ans:
  - i'm a scary guy.

- que:
  - any valuables?
  ans:
  - come on, thrill me.

- que:
  - what else have they got?
  ans:
  - well, you know, not that much.

- que:
  - why don't we just try somewhere else?
  ans:
  - because you're set up here.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - well, to tell you the truth, i've never flown south.

- que:
  - then how come you haven't gone?
  ans:
  - something's always stopping me.

- que:
  - want some more popcorn?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - my pin.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - my ring.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - i can do it.

- que:
  - go where?
  ans:
  - down the drain.

- que:
  - how's it so far?
  ans:
  - wet.

- que:
  - what does it look like?
  ans:
  - like the inside of your nose.

- que:
  - can you see the bottom yet?
  ans:
  - no, just more pipe.

- que:
  - is that a new top?
  ans:
  - you know, you have such taste.

- que:
  - this string?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - stuart?
  ans:
  - good guess, mom.

- que:
  - you let our son go down the kitchen drain?
  ans:
  - now, eleanor, don't be upset.

- que:
  - there is no more.
  ans:
  - are you okay?

- que:
  - spaghetti?
  ans:
  - we're out of spaghetti.

- que:
  - well, do we have macaroni?
  ans:
  - don't scare me like that.

- que:
  - what if someone had accidentally turned on the garbage disposal?
  ans:
  - i would not have let that happen.

- que:
  - if martha wanted to go up the chimney...... or george wanted to go into the toilet, would you let them?
  ans:
  - i love stuart as much as you do.

- que:
  - what were you going to say?
  ans:
  - i forget.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you people sure like your meat loaf.

- que:
  - you find the ring?
  ans:
  - everything but.

- que:
  - has anyone seen margalo?
  ans:
  - i can't find her anywhere.

- que:
  - but why'd she leave me her pin?
  ans:
  - oh, you know, stuart...... margalo is kind of a free spirit.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i think i know what happened.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - i'm going to find her.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - you can't go out there.

- que:
  - because i'm too small?
  ans:
  - let me tell you something, you're as big as you feel.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - make something up.

- que:
  - is that a trick question?
  ans:
  - it's important.

- que:
  - and why would i do that?
  ans:
  - well, because we're family...... and because i'd do the same for you.

- que:
  - you know something?
  ans:
  - everybody thinks you're so nice.

- que:
  - where's stuart?
  ans:
  - he already left.

- que:
  - without eating breakfast?
  ans:
  - he had to get to school early...... because he's in a school play.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why didn't he tell us?
  ans:
  - he forgot.

- que:
  - oh, why not?
  ans:
  - giving up is fun.

- que:
  - he's not home?
  ans:
  - oh, i just remembered.

- que:
  - on a school night?
  ans:
  - hey, that's what he said.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - hey, will.

- que:
  - if my mom calls, stuart's at your house, okay?
  ans:
  - hold on a second.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - will, hi.

- que:
  - stuart?
  ans:
  - you know, my son.

- que:
  - you mean now?
  ans:
  - well, now is when i'm calling.

- que:
  - well, then, is your mother there?
  ans:
  - hold on a second.

- que:
  - did she buy it?
  ans:
  - yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mom.

- que:
  - what will i tell her?
  ans:
  - make something up.

- que:
  - now will you tell me what's going on?
  ans:
  - it's too complicated.

- que:
  - boys home?
  ans:
  - well, george is.

- que:
  - he's going without george?
  ans:
  - i think it'll give him room to grow.

- que:
  - how about the alley?
  ans:
  - i'm a house cat.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - we've been looking all over for you.

- que:
  - hey, snow, are you two still friends or can i eat him?
  ans:
  - no, monty, you can't eat him.

- que:
  - falcon?
  ans:
  - oh, that's a bad guy.

- que:
  - where would we find him?
  ans:
  - you don't want to find him.

- que:
  - snowbell, are you all right?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - stay on track, will you?
  ans:
  - i'm nervous.

- que:
  - george?
  ans:
  - george doesn't know poop from applesauce.

- que:
  - can you speak louder?
  ans:
  - george, it's me, stuart.

- que:
  - when'll you be home?
  ans:
  - mom and dad are asking lots of questions.

- que:
  - but where are you?
  ans:
  - now, listen closely.

- que:
  - is that stuart?
  ans:
  - let me think.

- que:
  - found what?
  ans:
  - the calculator.

- que:
  - will, where's stuart?
  ans:
  - it's okay.

- que:
  - i just need to get the calculator?
  ans:
  - to figure out how long to rehearse.

- que:
  - what are you planning to do, mighty mouse, scale the wall?
  ans:
  - i'll think of something.

- que:
  - is anybody here?
  ans:
  - tell me right now.

- que:
  - fly away while i've got him covered.
  ans:
  - is she all right?

- que:
  - what are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - this kid's priceless.

- que:
  - tell me, cheese face, does this sound familiar?
  ans:
  - oh, my wing.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i can't drill through the wood.

- que:
  - margalo, what does he mean?
  ans:
  - okay, now it's getting sad.

- que:
  - but, margalo, why?
  ans:
  - don't be upset, mouse boy.

- que:
  - a real friend?
  ans:
  - i didn't lie about that, stuart.

- que:
  - was that your best shot?
  ans:
  - now, let me show you mine.

- que:
  - what have i done?
  ans:
  - i'll bet something terrible has happened.

- que:
  - who am i kidding?
  ans:
  - i have to get up there.

- que:
  - but how?
  ans:
  - i hope i live to regret this.

- que:
  - yoo hoo?
  ans:
  - come out, come out wherever you are.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - ln the can.

- que:
  - is this some kind of trick?
  ans:
  - just get me out.

- que:
  - is stuart in there, too?
  ans:
  - no, snowbell, he's dead.

- que:
  - stuart is dead?
  ans:
  - falcon killed him.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - george and will?
  ans:
  - this is terrible.

- que:
  - what have i done?
  ans:
  - and this time, the truth.

- que:
  - is it okay to break a promise to your brother?
  ans:
  - it's wrong to promise your brother you'll lie to your parents.

- que:
  - how would we all feel if anything happened to stuart?
  ans:
  - he's at the pishkin building.

- que:
  - am i in trouble?
  ans:
  - no, son.

- que:
  - who would do this?
  ans:
  - or else you'll lose this.

- que:
  - oh, and what do you think you'll be without me?
  ans:
  - i think this is it.

- que:
  - going up?
  ans:
  - frederick, i feel so helpless.

- que:
  - party's over, fur face.
  ans:
  - what do you mean?

- que:
  - got you.
  ans:
  - what's he doing?

- que:
  - can't i get a decent meal in this city?
  ans:
  - i am now.

- que:
  - what did you think you were doing?
  ans:
  - you almost gave me a heart attack.

- que:
  - then why am i so proud of you?
  ans:
  - mrs. little, this belongs to you.

- que:
  - snowbell, where have you been?
  ans:
  - you wouldn't believe what stuart and margalo have been through.

- que:
  - tuna?
  ans:
  - i guess.

- que:
  - you've always dreamed of going, haven't you?
  ans:
  - but falcon never let you.

- que:
  - you're sure of the way?
  ans:
  - we can call aaa.

- que:
  - only what, dear?
  ans:
  - well, now it's not just talk.

- que:
  - are you scared?
  ans:
  - the world's pretty big, and i'm pretty small.

- que:
  - what's the silver lining this time?
  ans:
  - she'll be back in the spring.

- que:
  - when she can fall from a tree and land on her feet, then i'll be impressed.
  ans:
  - did you hear that?

- que:
  - honey, are you all right?
  ans:
  - you're dreaming.

- que:
  - is that better?
  ans:
  - my poor baby.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the one you told me about.

- que:
  - who is she?
  ans:
  - nobody.

- que:
  - what's her name?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

  ans:
  - let's do it.

- que:

  ans:
  - just think about it.

- que:
  - you believe him?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - lori, move. that you've closed the pyramid mine... because you found alien artifacts inside?
  ans:
  - there's a lot better places than mars.

- que:
  - don't you wanna see saturn?
  ans:
  - i wish we could find some artifacts.

- que:
  - have you found kuato yet?
  ans:
  - we don't even know what he looks like.

- que:
  - what do you say?
  ans:
  - that's the news.

- que:
  - don't you understand?
  ans:
  - i feel like i was made for something more than this.

- que:
  - she was hauser's wife?
  ans:
  - forget that i said wife.

- que:
  - why would i lie to you?
  ans:
  - because you're still working for cohaagen.

- que:
  - inside what?
  ans:

- que:
  - how much is cohaagen paying you for this?
  ans:
  - think about it.

- que:
  - brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure?
  ans:
  - just as you specified.

- que:
  - is that coincidence?
  ans:
  - she's real.

- que:
  - she's real because you dreamed her?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - would you mind opening the door?
  ans:
  - you open it.

- que:
  - sweetheart?
  ans:
  - come in, mrs. quaid.

  - then what?
  ans:
  - swallow this.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it's a symbol of your desire to return to reality.

  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - did he have a secret hiding place?
  ans:
  - no, i don't know.

  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - would that be an accurate statement?

- que:
  - why don't we get some coffee?
  ans:
  - you must be somebody's something special.

- que:
  - getting them to reassign me to a case that i'd been so resoundedly removed from?

- que:
  - you think those assholes upstairs give a shit and a shake about michael calvess?
  ans:
  - they didn't know him, they don't care about him, and they can't forget about him fast enough.

- que:
  - can't do both.
  ans:
  - why do you suppose that is?

- que:
  - are you mrs. dudley?

  ans:
  - i love it.

- que:
  - aren't they great?
  ans:
  - prada.

- que:
  - what do you do, eleanor?
  ans:
  - i'm between jobs right now.
