- que:
  - but it's the fact...
  ans:
  - still sleeping... perhaps wrong dosage?

- que:
  - so there is no winner after this world war?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - this is the war, right?
  ans:
  - but it's different here.

- que:
  - why brought me here?

- que:
  - did we meet before?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - athena you arranged that attack, right?
  ans:
  - it's impossible for the mercenaries to confront with eswat.

- que:
  - we should protect people like sheep not wolves, shouldn't we?
  ans:
  - indeed that's the principle for our first generation bioriod.

- que:
  - beautiful, isn't it?
  ans:
  - remember yesterday, it's like a dream.

- que:
  - bioriod?
  ans:
  - man made human.

- que:
  - clone?
  ans:
  - no, not the simple clone, but the elite human clone.

- que:
  - does it mean that the city is controlled by clone?
  ans:
  - it's not polite to say\" clone\".

- que:
  - ultravibrate gravity?
  ans:
  - yes, like flying.

- que:
  - but can you control the car by that wheel?
  ans:
  - because of the automation, this wheel is\" for the people\".

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - city planners used to say that.

- que:
  - i. n?
  ans:
  - means\" intellectual network control central system\". aka.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - human has emotions.

- que:
  - who is he?
  ans:
  - general commander of olympus military.

- que:
  - you know her?
  ans:
  - guess not.

- que:
  - scared, right?
  ans:
  - until now the eswat under athena is growing bigger.

- que:
  - something wrong?
  ans:
  - we've got company.

- que:
  - hitomi, are you ok?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - are you hurt?
  ans:
  - i am ok. and i bring you deunan.

- que:
  - the legislative institute and administrative institute began to confront each other. on the issues of bioriod population increasing, etc.
  ans:
  - you know my father?

- que:
  - it's carl's daughter that athena wanted, right?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - degree of the information source?
  ans:
  - it's 5.

- que:
  - what did you fight for?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - hitomi, are you late for the life prolong process?
  ans:
  - no problem, i will go there in two days.

- que:
  - such as\" how have you been?
  ans:
  - nice to meet you again\".

- que:
  - but who are they?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what's apple seed?
  ans:
  - no idea.

- que:
  - may i sit here?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - deunan, how about your father carl?
  ans:
  - he died before the great war.

- que:
  - your mother?
  ans:
  - i cannot remember anything about her.

- que:
  - you and briareos were lovers, right?
  ans:
  - when he was human.

- que:
  - ahh?
  ans:
  - you know bioriod's emotions are restrained.

- que:
  - woman in love, how is that?
  ans:
  - the feeling to love someone.

- que:
  - all secured?
  ans:
  - yes, no problem.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - this is the only option under martial law.

- que:
  - regardless of our olympus military?
  ans:
  - i only chose the best option.

- que:
  - are you sure she could be saved?
  ans:
  - as long as we find the lost apple seed.

- que:
  - do you know dr. gilliam?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is it true that the first generation bioroids was born in this research center?
  ans:
  - yes, according to my superior.

- que:
  - why did dr. gilliam try to restrain the procreative ability of bioroids?
  ans:
  - deunan, this mission is dangerous.

- que:
  - can i ask you a question?
  ans:
  - i can't believe it...

- que:
  - i had to hide it.
  ans:
  - what's wrong, deunan?

- que:
  - bad guys?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you're dr. gilliam?
  ans:
  - don't move from there please.

- que:
  - but to trusting your men is always your weakness, briareos.
  ans:
  - how did they know we were here?

- que:
  - briareos, what's going on?
  ans:
  - let me tell you deunan.

- que:
  - remember my land mate got away from him?
  ans:
  - because of him, many bioroids died.

- que:
  - but the information in your hand will destroy our plan.
  ans:
  - is that true?

- que:
  - could you please give it to me?
  ans:
  - i refuse.

- que:
  - general, isn't it rather strange?
  ans:
  - seven old men want the apple seed.

- que:
  - did you have my mom killed?
  ans:
  - deunan please forgive us.

- que:
  - why did mom hide apple seed?
  ans:
  - dr. gilliam gave us our only hope.

- que:
  - step out?
  ans:
  - we humans must pass the future of earth over to the bioroids.

- que:
  - a virus developed by my mom?
  ans:
  - yes, on the top of tartarus.

- que:
  - what do you want, athena?
  ans:
  - to prevent the perdition of human race, bioroids were created.

- que:
  - have you forgotten that?
  ans:
  - bioroids were set to obey the orders of humans.

- que:
  - general uranus?
  ans:
  - gaea should have known all these things.

- que:
  - the defense system of the d tank is unbreakable, right?
  ans:
  - if hit by a spider cannon at point blank, it will break.

- que:
  - a powerful sword and a perfect shield, which will win?
  ans:
  - we are trying.

- que:
  - why not let the new humans bear the sin of the human race?
  ans:
  - let it go.

- que:
  - we can't stop it.
  ans:
  - how about no. 8?

- que:
  - deunan, hitomi.
  ans:
  - how come?

- que:
  - where are the old men?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - utopia, eh...
  ans:
  - about what happened to your body?

- que:
  - did we get the landing permit from olympus a5?
  ans:
  - don't get too close before id is confirmed or the multi legged cannon will fire at us.

- que:
  - but this is the truth...
  ans:
  - still sleeping... perhaps wrong dosage of anesthesia?

- que:
  - so after such a large scale world war, there is no winner?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - that's how war is, isn't it?
  ans:
  - but it's different here.

- que:
  - why brought me here?
  ans:
  - because you are an elite soldier.

- que:
  - eswat?
  ans:
  - i know you must have lots of questions.

- que:
  - haven't slept on a soft bed for a long time, haven't you?
  ans:
  - i'il pick you up at 10 am tomorrow.

- que:
  - you are hitomi, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - haven't we meet before?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - athena you arranged that attack, didn't you?
  ans:
  - it's impossible for the mercenaries to confront with eswat.

- que:
  - now, bioriod won't be able to do as they wishes.
  ans:
  - did you forget the mission of bioriod?

- que:
  - we should not be protecting wolves. instead we should protect the sheep like human, shouldn't we?
  ans:
  - indeed that's the principle for our first generation bioriod.

- que:
  - beautiful city, isn't it?
  ans:
  - comparing with where i was yesterday, it's like a dream.

- que:
  - bioriod?
  ans:
  - man made human.

- que:
  - clones?
  ans:
  - no, not simple clones, but man made human with carefully selected human gene.

- que:
  - does it mean that the city is controlled by clones?
  ans:
  - it's not polite to say\" clone\".

- que:
  - ultravibrate gravity?
  ans:
  - yes, like hovering.

- que:
  - but, you control the car by that steering wheel?
  ans:
  - in this city, the use of automation technology has reached such level, this wheel is a symbol of the\" for the people\" idea.

- que:
  - what's that all about?
  ans:
  - city planners used to say that.

- que:
  - i. n.?
  ans:
  - means\" intellectual network\".

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - human has emotions.

- que:
  - who is general uranus?
  ans:
  - general commander of olympus military.

- que:
  - you know her?
  ans:
  - probably not.

- que:
  - scary, right?
  ans:
  - recently the eswat under athena's control is growing bigger.

- que:
  - something wrong?
  ans:
  - we've got company.

- que:
  - hitomi, are you okay?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - are you hurt?
  ans:
  - i am okay.

- que:
  - the legislative institute and administrative institute began to confront each other over the issues of bioriod population increasing, etc.
  ans:
  - you know my father?

- que:
  - athena is really targeting carl's daughter?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - degree of the information source?
  ans:
  - it's level 5.

- que:
  - what did you fight for?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - hitomi, aren't you late for the life prolonging procedure?
  ans:
  - no problem, i will have it done there soon.

- que:
  - such as\" how have you been in two years?
  ans:
  - or\" nice to meet you again\".

- que:
  - but why would any one be interested in me, and who are these people?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what is\" apple seed\"?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - may i sit here?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - deunan, how about your father carl knute?
  ans:
  - he died before the great war.

- que:

  ans:
  - ahh...

  - not my conference.

- que:
  - hardly a routine meeting, would you say?
  ans:
  - and look, cal, we won't buy the committee getting you v. i. p. s together for a cocktail party.

  ans:
  - boston, wasn't it?

- que:
  - the club?
  ans:
  - that's what we call it.

- que:
  - not exactly what you expected, dr. meacham, is it?
  ans:
  - that's brack, one of exeter's assistants.

- que:
  - what language do they speak?
  ans:
  - english, hindustani, congoese.

- que:
  - may i use you as exhibit\" a\"?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid dr. meacham isn't too happy with me.

- que:
  - nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
  ans:
  - however, let me assure you, doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such, we can accomplish wonders.

- que:
  - well, what do you think of us?
  ans:
  - this all sounds great, mr.

- que:
  - exeter, but why me?
  ans:
  - dr. meacham, we happen to know that you're on the threshold...

- que:
  - suppose when i do, i find i can't go along with you?
  ans:
  - naturally, we'il expect you to be discreet about what you've seen here.

- que:
  - conserving energy is one of our primary concerns, isn't it, doctor?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - any reason why you can't start in the morning, doctor?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - other units?
  ans:
  - yes, we have several at strategic points throughout the world.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - why schedule as planned.

- que:
  - mozart, exeter?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid i don't know the chap.

- que:
  - composer?
  ans:
  - he belongs to the world.

- que:
  - you, dr. carlson?
  ans:
  - show him the grounds.

- que:
  - what are you getting at?
  ans:
  - i seem to remember that was part of exeter's pitch.

- que:
  - how about you and dr. adams showing me my laboratory instead?
  ans:
  - after all i've heard today, i can hardly wait to add my little contribution... to the good work.

- que:
  - well, what do you think of it?
  ans:
  - it's not bad.

- que:
  - what's your opinion, doctors?
  ans:
  - all right, i'il spell it out for you.

- que:
  - we have a right to throw a few questions at you. what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - look, i received a darn fool catalog.

- que:
  - sunlamp?
  ans:
  - that's what it looks like.

- que:
  - what about the others?
  ans:
  - try talking to them.

- que:
  - who's exeter working for?
  ans:
  - we don't know.

- que:
  - why did you wait, brack?
  ans:
  - you should have told me.

- que:
  - if you're so concerned, why don't you let me use the transformer?
  ans:
  - the transformer is not the only answer.

- que:
  - it may be true, but are you sure?
  ans:
  - we're 30 miles from nowhere.

- que:
  - and if we did get out, who'd believe all this?
  ans:
  - i don't blame you doctors for being excited about working for exeter.

- que:
  - why not, brack?
  ans:
  - and perhaps you'd like me to step in with him.

- que:
  - notice that section of lead plate behind you?
  ans:
  - please bring it forward about eight feet.

- que:
  - neutrino rays?
  ans:
  - you've just observed one in action.

- que:
  - do you notice...
  ans:
  - the green light?

- que:
  - the peculiar indentations in both their foreheads?
  ans:
  - coincidental, no doubt.

- que:
  - are you prepared to leave?
  ans:
  - we have been since your last communication, although meacham and adams are achieving positive results.

- que:
  - can you give us another time period?
  ans:
  - impossible.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - something i've seen before.

- que:
  - is it flyable?
  ans:
  - it should be.

- que:
  - like the others in that house?
  ans:
  - what happened was beyond my control.

- que:
  - where are we going?
  ans:
  - to a planet we call metaluna.

- que:
  - metaluna?
  ans:
  - there's no such planet in the solar system.

- que:
  - how are you controlling the fantastic temperature on this ship?
  ans:
  - what's to prevent us from floating around like balloons...

- que:
  - once we leave earth's gravity?
  ans:
  - to answer the last question first, we create our own gravitational field.

- que:
  - what are you doing to them?
  ans:
  - metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like that in your greatest oceans.

- que:
  - brack?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and you?
  ans:
  - feel like a new toothbrush.

- que:
  - what don't you understand, doctor?
  ans:
  - those two objects.

- que:
  - is zahgon a planet?
  ans:
  - a planet that was once a comet.

- que:
  - to where?
  ans:
  - to your earth.

- que:
  - then why haven't your superior brains solved the problem of synthesizing uranium?
  ans:
  - most of our scientists are dead, our major laboratories destroyed.

- que:
  - do you still insist, exeter, that we can allow any of these earth creatures to have free minds?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - in there?
  ans:
  - my mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it.

- que:
  - do you believe him, cal?
  ans:
  - the spaceship.

- que:
  - don't you understand?
  ans:
  - i'il be all right.

- que:
  - will we be able to get out?
  ans:
  - depends on the amount of energy we have left.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - i'il use the third tube.

- que:
  - exeter, are these tubes strong enough to keep him out?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - our universe is vast, full of wonders.

  - what s it matter?
  ans:
  - he s home now.

- que:

  ans:
  - i don t care.

- que:

- que:

- que:
  - do we have the hamburgers yet?

- que:
  - we pick them up?
  ans:
  - he was interested in having the wto come speak at the economics department.

- que:
  - can you do it?
  ans:
  - i'm thinking that you probably shouldn't be associated with the hamburgers.

- que:
  - and... who is to say whether people in the third world want a burger?
  ans:
  - we're culturally different.

- que:
  - like... if you saw have you ever seen starving people?
  ans:
  - in pictures.

- que:
  - this is a money maker, correct?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how are you going to get around the cultural and legal implications of cannibalism and basically asking us to recycle shit?
  ans:
  - the reality is that we already treat people in the third world far worse than we treat our domestic animals.

- que:
  - hello. how are you?
  ans:
  - good, thanks.

  - where are you now?
  ans:

- que:
  - so were you and your son close?
  ans:
  - no, not of late, anyway.

- que:
  - what did he say on the message?
  ans:
  - not much, really.

- que:
  - so, what did he do around here?
  ans:

  - all right?
  ans:
  - let's go back to work.

  - where'd you get pruitt's?
  ans:
  - they're on computer file.

- que:
  - and left the other two intact?
  ans:
  - no, he definitely dropped...... that. 38 by accident at the struggle.

- que:
  - why'd someone want him dead so bad they beat him to death?
  ans:
  - man has a gun on you, you'd do whatever he says...... even let him knock you around.

- que:
  - why take the time to beat him?
  ans:
  - that's my point.

  ans:
  - we should check him out some more.

- que:
  - dr. leeds?
  ans:
  - you need to check with lab processing.

- que:

  ans:
  - i can't be sure.

- que:

- que:
  - what's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - come on, detective.

- que:
  - what's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - i guess you'd have to be, passing your detective exam so young and all.

  ans:
  - such a lovely place.

- que:
  - don't you think it's lovely, mary poppins?
  ans:
  - now's the time, mary poppins.

- que:
  - do what?
  ans:
  - bit of magic.

- que:
  - a bit of magic?
  ans:
  - it's easy.

- que:
  - why do you always complicate things that are really quite simple?
  ans:
  - give my your hand, please, michael.

- que:
  - do you really think so?
  ans:
  - cross my heart you do.

- que:
  - very nice, indeed... if you don't wanna go nowhere.
  ans:
  - down the road behind the hill, remember?

  ans:
  - who says we're not going anywhere?

- que:
  - come on, my lad.
  ans:
  - do you hear that, mate?

- que:
  - is that the best you can do?
  ans:
  - hurry up, boy.

- que:
  - now hang on.
  ans:
  - view halloo?

- que:
  - would you look at that now?
  ans:

  - uh, how does it feel, mary poppins, winning the race?
  ans:
  - oh, well i...

- que:
  - am i right, bert?
  ans:
  - tell 'em what it is.

- que:
  - but that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
  ans:
  - indubitably.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - people who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine.

- que:
  - do you have a handkerchief under your pillow?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - easily made, easily broken.
  ans:
  - will you stay if we promise to be good?

- que:
  - whatever would we do without you?
  ans:
  - i shall stay until the wind changes.

- que:
  - but, mary poppins, how long will that be?
  ans:
  - silence, please.

- que:
  - a respectable person like me in a horse race?
  ans:
  - how dare you suggest such a thing.

- que:
  - put in a double charge of powder.
  ans:
  - is that clear?

- que:
  - a double charge?
  ans:
  - aye, aye, sir.

- que:
  - shake things up a bit, what?
  ans:
  - lovely, lovely morning, ellen.

- que:
  - have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - what's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?
  ans:
  - it's cook singing.

- que:
  - what's wrong with her?
  ans:
  - she's happy as a cricket.

- que:
  - is that so?
  ans:
  - take ellen for instance.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - well, that is extraordinary.

- que:
  - who said i'm not feeling well?
  ans:
  - i don't think there's anything to explain.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - it's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.

- que:
  - yes, dear?
  ans:
  - i suggest you have this piano repaired.

- que:
  - dig for buried treasure?
  ans:
  - we're going to buy some fish.

- que:
  - and thank you very much.
  ans:
  - again?

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - he said,\" you're welcome\".

- que:
  - what else did he say?
  ans:
  - i don't think he said anything.

- que:
  - why don't you go home and put your feet up?
  ans:
  - oh, bert, i'm glad you're here.

- que:
  - well, how is he?
  ans:
  - it's contagious, you know.

- que:
  - shall we get spots?
  ans:
  - oh, highly unlikely.

- que:
  - but i so enjoy laughing, you know?
  ans:
  - and, well...

- que:
  - speaking of names, i know a man with a wooden leg named smith.
  ans:
  - in a watch factory?

- que:
  - wasn't that funny?
  ans:
  - yes, please.

- que:
  - uh, bert?
  ans:
  - uh, no, no, thank you.

- que:
  - nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - the shopkeeper said to him,\" how long do you want it?
  ans:
  - your tea, uncle albert.

- que:
  - and the lady said,\" that's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?
  ans:
  - you know, people come to see me all the time, you know.

- que:
  - uh, keep an eye on uncle albert, will you, bert?
  ans:
  - i'il sit with him a while.

- que:
  - would you like to hear it?
  ans:
  - i'd be so grateful.

- que:
  - well, it's about me granddad, see?
  ans:
  - and one night, he had a nightmare, he did.

- que:
  - \" how do you feel, granddad?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - want to hear a joke?
  ans:
  - we had the most wonderful afternoon with mary poppins.

- que:
  - smith?
  ans:
  - we don't know anyone called smith.

- que:
  - oh.
  ans:
  - and there was a second chap, and the second chap says,\" what's the name of his other leg?

- que:
  - oh, mary poppins said that, did she?
  ans:
  - will you please return to your room.

- que:
  - mary poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?
  ans:
  - as you wish.

- que:
  - is anything the matter?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid there is.

- que:
  - george, are you certain you know what you're doing?
  ans:
  - i believe i do, winifred.

- que:
  - but tea parties on the ceiling?
  ans:
  - i ask you.

- que:
  - where are we going?
  ans:
  - to the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

- que:
  - i proposed?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - winifred, did i say that i was going to take the children to the bank?
  ans:
  - it certainly sounded that way, dear.

- que:
  - kindly stop spinning about me.
  ans:
  - and why not?

- que:
  - but?
  ans:
  - goats butt, birds fly... and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep.

- que:
  - an outing with father?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - manage what?
  ans:
  - to the bank.

- que:
  - past the end of his nose?
  ans:
  - the bird woman.

- que:
  - you do see her, don't you, father?
  ans:
  - well, of course i can see her.

- que:
  - do you think i can't see past the end of my nose?
  ans:
  - listen, father, she's saying it.

- que:
  - whatever for?
  ans:
  - i have tuppence from my money box.

- que:
  - waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds?
  ans:
  - certainly not.

- que:
  - what's all this about?
  ans:
  - these are my children, mr dawes.

- que:
  - but why are they here?
  ans:
  - they wish to open an account, sir.

- que:
  - oh, indeed?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and just how much money do you have, young man?
  ans:
  - tuppence.

- que:
  - tuppence?
  ans:
  - precisely how i started.

- que:
  - a giant?
  ans:
  - shh, shh, shh.

- que:
  - oh, they do, do they, boy?
  ans:
  - excellent.

- que:
  - may i be permitted to see it?
  ans:
  - all for the lack of...

- que:
  - now, who's after you?
  ans:
  - father is.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he brought us to see his bank.

- que:
  - well, now that don't seem likely, does it?
  ans:
  - it's true.

- que:
  - father in a cage?
  ans:
  - they makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

- que:
  - oh, sure about that, are you?
  ans:
  - look at it this way.

- que:
  - who looks after your father?
  ans:
  - tell me that.

- que:
  - when something terrible happens, what does he do?
  ans:
  - fends for himself, he does.

- que:
  - michael, be quiet.
  ans:
  - who does he tell about it?

- que:
  - bert, do you think father really needs our help?
  ans:
  - well, not my place to say.

- que:
  - you haven't been running off again, have you?
  ans:
  - you know how terribly it upsets me.

- que:
  - well, will you ask mrs brill?
  ans:
  - you've been so kind in looking after the children.

- que:
  - uh, me, ma'am?
  ans:
  - w well, well, i i i have to be moving along.

- que:
  - you see how wrong people can be?
  ans:
  - that there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

- que:
  - it's like i got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it?
  ans:
  - well, that's a bit awkward.

- que:
  - well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?
  ans:
  - michael, don't be frightened.

- que:
  - will you put your things on at once?
  ans:
  - hurry up, please.

- que:
  - it's just good, clean soot, michael.
  ans:
  - why not, mary poppins?

- que:
  - as far as we go, right?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - what did i tell ya?
  ans:
  - there's the whole world at your feet.

- que:
  - and who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?
  ans:
  - lovely.

- que:
  - will you be good enough to explain all this?
  ans:
  - first of all, i would like to make one thing quite clear.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i never explain anything.

- que:
  - tonight, sir?
  ans:
  - yes, banks.

- que:
  - you know what i think?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, of course.

- que:
  - do you know what she did?
  ans:
  - i realize it now.

- que:
  - tricked you into taking the children on an outing?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - father?
  ans:
  - we're sorry about the tuppence.

- que:
  - will that make everything all right?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - do you know what happened?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - do you deny it?
  ans:
  - i do not deny it, sir.

- que:
  - steady on.
  ans:
  - what are you waiting for?

- que:
  - well, do you have anything to say, banks?
  ans:
  - just one word, sir.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - supercalifragilistic expialidocious.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - there's no such word.

- que:
  - snapper?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what's the name of his other leg?
  ans:
  - my nanny.

- que:
  - she only promised to stay till the wind changed.
  ans:
  - father?

- que:
  - and what would happen to me, may i ask... if i loved all the children i said goodbye to?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, that's right.

- que:
  - on the premises?
  ans:
  - i can't make out what the inspector's sayin '.

- que:
  - what happened at the bank?
  ans:
  - i've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

- que:
  - george, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?
  ans:
  - you'il see in a moment.

- que:
  - michael?
  ans:
  - your father's calling you.

- que:
  - michael?
  ans:
  - that's what i said, sir.

- que:
  - well, don't you care?
  ans:
  - practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

- que:
  - is that so?
  ans:
  - well, i'il tell you one thing, mary poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - yes, really.

- que:
  - that s why you need me, right?
  ans:
  - that depends on how you look at it.

- que:
  - what s with all that noise in your brain today?
  ans:
  - must be a loose wire.

- que:
  - don t you think this is going to be trouble later if section 9 interferes with section 6?
  ans:
  - if section 6 manages to catch the bastard, then all they can really do about it is deporting him.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i don t believe it.

- que:
  - so what business brings the chief of section 9 to the ministry of foreign affairs?
  ans:
  - i need to ask you about the secret talks scheduled with the gavel republic tomorrow.

- que:
  - what s the ministry going to do?
  ans:
  - well, there s a problem.

- que:
  - you mean colonel maless, correct?
  ans:
  - yes, and that means we either tonight grant them the funds   and treat maless as a political refugee, or help them.

- que:
  - what s happening to the eeg output?
  ans:
  - it s normal.

- que:
  - so how much time do we have before this hacker breaks through her barrier program   and reaches her ghost?
  ans:
  - roughly two hours.

- que:
  - are we talking about the puppet master, the infamous mystery hacker?
  ans:
  - well, we don t know a lot either.

- que:
  - so, why the nick name?
  ans:
  - the nick name  puppet master  comes from the ghost hacking.

- que:
  - well, if he s so skilled, how come he s using an outdated ha 3 virus?
  ans:
  - think about it a minute.

- que:
  - just so no one would suspect maless?
  ans:
  - or maybe someone wants us to think in that direction.

- que:
  - which reminds me, are you still using that revolver?
  ans:
  - you should stop worrying about the automatics jamming up.

- que:
  - why did you transfer a guy like me from the police force?
  ans:
  - because we need a guy like you.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - my wife never has any time.

- que:
  - how did you get your hands on a barrier breaker?
  ans:
  - from this really nice fella.

- que:
  - hey, pop.
  ans:
  - what s the point in us breaking our butts?

- que:
  - did you see someone or not?
  ans:
  - clever.

- que:
  - got it?
  ans:
  - we got the data on the refuse collection points.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - ain t no way i m gonna be your partner in crime.

- que:
  - just arrest them.
  ans:
  - see?

- que:
  - hm?
  ans:
  - ah.

- que:
  - got him, huh?
  ans:
  - ghost hacked.

- que:
  - so who is it?
  ans:
  - 28.

- que:
  - and in reality?
  ans:
  - his nick name s corgi.

- que:
  - and how is ishikawa doing?
  ans:
  - about the same progress as the rest of us.

- que:
  - come in?
  ans:
  - he s only a puppet himself.

- que:
  - what s a simulated experience again?
  ans:
  - well.

- que:
  - this is the photo you showed to your co worker.
  ans:
  - do you understand what i m saying?

- que:
  - what do you see?
  ans:
  - i had a picture of her.

- que:
  - where did you meet your wife, and when did you marry her?
  ans:
  - i m sorry to put you through this, pal.

- que:
  - will i get my own memory back?
  ans:
  - your original memory will never be fully restored,   and there might be resituational simulation.

- que:
  - what if the floaters don t work or something else fails?
  ans:
  - i suppose i il die then.

- que:
  - or would you dive in to rescue me?
  ans:
  - i didn t beg you to come along, and i sure as hell don t want a lecture.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i thought you d already been through all the underwater training courses.

- que:
  - in those deep, dark waters?
  ans:
  - when i float weightless back to the surface, i m imaging i m becoming someone else.

- que:
  - batou, how much of your body is original?  hey, are you drunk or something?
  ans:
  - easily remedy.

- que:
  - who re we to complain?
  ans:
  - i suppose the occasional tune up is a small price to pay for all this.

- que:
  - what the hell is it that you see at the bottom in that darkness?
  ans:
  - what we see now is like a dim image in a mirror ; then we shall see face to face.

- que:
  - that was you, wasn t it?
  ans:
  - sensors have resumed function.

- que:
  - shall we?
  ans:
  - that s enough.

- que:
  - caught traffic, major?
  ans:
  - guess i il be nice and bring the latecomer up to speed.

- que:
  - yeah, why not?
  ans:
  - even a doll can seem to have a soul.

- que:
  - make sure that the barriers are on too.
  ans:
  - where s the logic in that?

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - chief, i m assembling a barrier maze.

- que:
  - why not contain it in another body first?
  ans:
  - i have to see for myself what s in there.

- que:
  - today?
  ans:
  - you know, she s been acting weird from the get go   ever since this whole puppet master episode started.

- que:
  - chief, you ve ever questioned the ethics of the neural sergeants   who monkey around inside your brain?
  ans:
  - they undergo psychiatrical evaluations, especially those in security.

- que:
  - tell ishikawa not to go crazy, okay?
  ans:
  - hey, what s on your mind?  that robot.

- que:
  - did we seem similar to you?  of course not.  no, i don t mean physically.  just what, then?
  ans:
  - well, i guess cyborgs like myself have a tendency to be paranoid about our origins.

- que:
  - have you ever seen your own brain?
  ans:
  - it sounds to me like you re doubting your own ghost.

- que:
  - and if it did, just what would be the importance of being human then?
  ans:
  - hm.

- que:
  - we are both busy men, so let s keep this short, shall we?
  ans:
  - yes, that s my intention.

- que:
  - security, whose official vehicles are in the basement parking lot?
  ans:
  - according to the register, a mr. nakamura from the treaties bureau and a dr. willis, sir.

- que:
  - does that nakamura guy have a special order cyborg body?
  ans:
  - no, there aren t any cyborgs in section 6.

- que:
  - you checked the pressure sensors in the parking structure, didn t you?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - the security camera show only two people,   but remember how sensitive the sensors on the entrance doors are?
  ans:
  - they took a full three seconds longer than usual to close after the two went in.

- que:
  - with my trusty matever?
  ans:
  - any time.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - well, what is it?  it s confirmed.

- que:
  - no doubt, it s him.   him ?
  ans:
  - uh  the doctor is referring to the original pattern of the ghost line that s now in the body.

- que:
  - you caused the puppet master to dive into a cyborg, then meanwhile murdered his real body?
  ans:
  - yes, that sums it up.

- que:
  - as a sentient life form, i hereby demand political asylum.
  ans:
  - why are your sensors on?

- que:
  - this is no proof at all that you re a living, thinking life form.
  ans:
  - is this a joke?

- que:
  - how can you?
  ans:
  - when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is.

- que:
  - fortunately there is no death sentence in this country.
  ans:
  - who the hell is this?

- que:
  - what is it  artificial intelligence?
  ans:
  - i fired off six shots at the front and rear windows.

  - who knows what the tide could bring?

- que:
  - where are you headed?
  ans:
  - well, i was just about to figure that out.

- que:
  - must the church be so drafty, mr. elton?
  ans:
  - it is very difficult to surrender the soul... when one is worried about one's throat.

- que:
  - miss taylor, surely you're not serving cake at your wedding?
  ans:
  - far too rich.

- que:
  - where is mr. perry, the apothecary?
  ans:
  - he will support me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i have to take father home.

- que:
  - why should she give up being your governess only to be married?
  ans:
  - i am grown now.

- que:
  - i said poor miss taylor and poor, indeed, she is.
  ans:
  - can she truly wish to give life to a mewling infant... who will import disease each time it enters the house?

- que:
  - and how is my sister? ls your brother giving her the respect... we woodhouse ladies deserve?
  ans:
  - poor lsabella.

- que:
  - but where is the fault with you?
  ans:
  - emma bears it well.

- que:
  - triumph?
  ans:
  - you made a lucky guess.

- que:
  - have you never known the triumph of a lucky guess?
  ans:
  - had i not promoted mr. weston's visits... and given encouragement where encouragement was needed, we might not have had a wedding today.

- que:
  - w well, how do you do, mr. elton?
  ans:
  - we are the happy ones, not only to be here tonight, but for the beautiful hindquarter of pork you sent us.

- que:
  - oh, doesn't your hair look pretty?
  ans:
  - just like an angel.

- que:
  - where will you live now that you've completed your education?
  ans:
  - mrs. goddard has been kind enough to let me stay on with her.

- que:
  - mr. weston, have you had any news of your son?
  ans:
  - oh, indeed.

- que:
  - have, have you ever read such a letter, mr. knightley?
  ans:
  - do you know, this... this reminds me of jane's style somewhat.

- que:
  - isn't miss smith delightful?
  ans:
  - i watched her with continuous pleasure.

- que:
  - and what kind of people are your parents?
  ans:
  - i do not know.

- que:
  - wasn't that kind?
  ans:
  - tell me more about mr. martin.

- que:
  - is he a man of information?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - and what sort of looking man is he?
  ans:
  - mmm.

- que:
  - have you never seen him when he is in town?
  ans:
  - fine, dear.

- que:
  - this is a bit of a chance, isn't it?
  ans:
  - good day, mr. martin.

- que:
  - miss woodhouse, may i present mr. martin?
  ans:
  - this is miss woodhouse.

- que:
  - how do you do?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - but i go again tomorrow, and i will make every effort to get that thought into my head.
  ans:
  - were you able to find the romance of the forest?

- que:
  - how's your mother?
  ans:
  - really, harriet, we can do better than this.

- que:
  - mr. elton said something very kind about you the other day.
  ans:
  - did he take your advice and get the book you asked him to read?

- que:
  - an idea has just dropped into my mind, surely from heaven itself.
  ans:
  - can you not tell me what it was?

- que:
  - what if you were to exercise your artistic talents... and draw a portrait of miss smith?
  ans:
  - how i would love to watch you draw her.

- que:
  - oh, miss woodhouse, may i look, please?
  ans:
  - i cannot wait another second.

- que:
  - might i be entrusted with such a commission?
  ans:
  - i would be gratified more than words can express.

- que:
  - you did not plan to return an answer favorable to this claim?
  ans:
  - but if you'il not influence me, i must do as well as i can by myself.

- que:
  - oh, do you think that's right or wrong? ls it wrong?
  ans:
  - now that you have decided, i will share the feelings i kept you in suspense of.

- que:
  - who makes you his confidant?
  ans:
  - i have reason to believe that harriet smith will soon receive... an offer of marriage from a man desperately in love with her.

- que:
  - oh, yes?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you saw her answer?
  ans:
  - emma.

- que:
  - you wrote her answer, didn't you?
  ans:
  - if i did, i would have done no wrong.

- que:
  - what are harriet smith's claims of birth or education... that make her higher than robert martin?
  ans:
  - she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.

- que:
  - even with all his merit, a match for my dear friend?
  ans:
  - it would be a degradation for her to marry a person... whom i could not admit as my own acquaintance.

- que:
  - for illegitimacy and ignorance... to marry to a respected, intelligent farmer?
  ans:
  - she is a gentleman's daughter.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - ship, dear.

- que:
  - he writes to me about courtship?
  ans:
  - harriet, i think we can have no doubt as to mr. elton's intentions.

- que:
  - mrs. clark, how are we?
  ans:
  - mustn't grumble.

- que:
  - what have you brought us?
  ans:
  - i am sorry i was not more help.

- que:
  - i heated some  soup?
  ans:
  - fire.

- que:
  - where are you off to?
  ans:
  - to town, ma'am, to get some broth.

- que:
  - dear, must we walk so quickly?
  ans:
  - mum said i should hurry.

- que:
  - do you mean it?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - the journey from london, how was it?
  ans:
  - if you accepted adults with as little whim as you do these children, we might always agree.

- que:
  - but hasn't the lapse of 21 years closed the gap?
  ans:
  - narrowed it.

- que:
  - sister, dear, when shall we meet your new friend, miss smith?
  ans:
  - i have some sad news.

- que:
  - yes, would you like a whiskey?
  ans:
  - not at the moment.

- que:
  - miss woodhouse, are you warm enough?
  ans:
  - yes, thank you.

- que:
  - when did you receive his news?
  ans:
  - you are very kind, but i can only imagine that he's quite comfortable.

- que:
  - i wondered if perhaps... you might be so kind as to bring me some punch?
  ans:
  - i only hope i can complete the task quickly enough.

- que:
  - how could i not be concerned?
  ans:
  - the whole situation is most alarming.

- que:
  - have i not some right to complain?
  ans:
  - emma, the weather's distressing your father.

- que:
  - mr. weston?
  ans:
  - come, mr. woodhouse.

- que:
  - miss smith?
  ans:
  - mr. elton, the wine has weakened you.

- que:
  - who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near?
  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - why else would i go to london to have your picture framed?
  ans:
  - allow me to interpret the silence.

- que:
  - how do you feel about what i have said?
  ans:
  - mr. elton, any hopes i had with regard to you were for harriet... and harriet alone.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - oh, miss taylor mrs. weston.

- que:
  - you knew?
  ans:
  - i had my suspicions, but the party confirmed it.

- que:
  - mr. knightley?
  ans:
  - he was very cross because i had urged harriet to reject a proposal from robert martin.

- que:
  - that nice farmer?
  ans:
  - at least there i was right.

- que:
  - too pert?
  ans:
  - my dear, you said you would never try to match anyone again.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - in his letter to father, he wrote he is going to bath to relax and meet new people.

- que:
  - mr. elton?
  ans:
  - while expressing his fervent admiration for you as a person, it is unhappily i who have captured his fancy.

- que:
  - do you suppose mr. elton is meeting young ladies while he is away?
  ans:
  - i do not know.

- que:
  - treat?
  ans:
  - but the best of it is, the best of it is... that we were just speaking of a topic that would interest you both.

- que:
  - isn't it nice to have visitors, mother?
  ans:
  - the most amusing thing just happened.

- que:
  - there you are.
  ans:
  - remember, mother?

- que:
  - oh, and cheat you out of the pleasure of hearing it, miss woodhouse, as only jane can put things?
  ans:
  - upon my honor, i would not.

- que:
  - where's that letter?
  ans:
  - yes, here it is.

- que:
  - how were you able to get away?
  ans:
  - the campbells have gone to lreland on a holiday.

- que:
  - was he handsome?
  ans:
  - many say he is.

- que:
  - was he agreeable?
  ans:
  - he was in no way disagreeable.

- que:
  - was he a man of information?
  ans:
  - all his statements seemed correct.

- que:
  - why should you care so much about frank churchill?
  ans:
  - i was merely being sociable, that's all, and she was not.

- que:
  - oh, good heavens.
  ans:
  - would you join me?

- que:
  - is your horse just washing his feet or are there darker forces at work here?
  ans:
  - the latter, i'm afraid.

- que:
  - then you have not seen them?
  ans:
  - we shall have to go there first.

- que:
  - i met him yesterday.
  ans:
  - oh, miss woodhouse, have you heard?

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - i have not yet seen him myself, though, um, jane saw him... and she said he was not at all unpleasant to look at.

- que:
  - but i don't wish them to hope falsely.
  ans:
  - has an invitation arrived for a party at the cole's?

- que:
  - has james brought the letters yet?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why do they not write?
  ans:
  - perhaps they know i must reject them.

- que:
  - perhaps she may know more.
  ans:
  - really?

- que:
  - do you know her?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, she's very elegant.

- que:
  - mrs. dixon?
  ans:
  - that makes sense.

- que:
  - very elegant, yes.
  ans:
  - as much sense do you think as mr. dixon?

- que:
  - but what makes you say that?
  ans:
  - well, she must think so too.

- que:
  - do you see?
  ans:
  - now that mr. dixon has married into the campbells, he would have been there.

- que:
  - my dear, do you know how miss bates and jane fairfax came here tonight?
  ans:
  - mr. knightley sent his carriage.

- que:
  - what if the pianoforte is from mr. knightley?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - do you know that piece from the beggar's opera?
  ans:
  - i don't approve of surprises.

- que:
  - miss fairfax, shall we sing another?
  ans:
  - that fellow thinks of nothing but showing off.

- que:
  - yes, mr. knightley?
  ans:
  - you must put a stop to this.

- que:
  - oh, do you think so?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - yes, aunt?
  ans:
  - dear, i wonder if i might say a word to you... before you and mr. churchill begin another song.

- que:
  - suckling.
  ans:
  - not even five minutes to spare for your friends, miss fairfax and miss bates?

- que:
  - and the size of the rooms?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - oh?
  ans:
  - i fancy not.

- que:
  - because i don't want to give up my talent.
  ans:
  - why does he not try bath?

- que:
  - was she not your governess?
  ans:
  - mrs. weston's modest propriety makes her a model for any woman.

- que:
  - do you know who came in while we were there?
  ans:
  - i cannot imagine.

- que:
  - quite the gentleman.
  ans:
  - knightley?

- que:
  - i saw her at church.
  ans:
  - knightley?

- que:
  - how do you do, mrs. starr?
  ans:
  - good morning, miss woodhouse.

- que:
  - is it possible that mr. elton met her... while doing charitable work in a mental infirmary?
  ans:
  - there is only one thing to do with a person as impossible as she.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i must throw a party for her, otherwise everyone will feel at once how much i dislike her.

- que:
  - i rave about her.
  ans:
  - do you know whom i just adore?

- que:
  - do you know what i admire most about her?
  ans:
  - she's timid.

- que:
  - do you know how high it is?
  ans:
  - oh, so, you two have been settling...

- que:
  - i'il go and see him.
  ans:
  - that i should marry jane fairfax?

- que:
  - well, mrs. weston, what do you say about your suspicions now?
  ans:
  - he's so very occupied with his not being in love with her, it seems certain that he is.

- que:
  - oh, wouldn't they be charming?
  ans:
  - it would so relieve me to know harriet was well taken care of.

- que:
  - are you waiting for someone?
  ans:
  - hmm, mrs. elton.

- que:
  - why ever for?
  ans:
  - i hear much of her.

- que:
  - oh, is that they?
  ans:
  - do, do excuse me.

- que:
  - how do you like jane's hair?
  ans:
  - she did it herself.

- que:
  - do you not dance, mr. elton?
  ans:
  - most readily, mrs. weston, if you will be my partner.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - certainly mrs. elton has no reason to dislike you.

- que:
  - what is the point in me being almost 22... if there is still so much for me to learn?
  ans:
  - you know more than you realize.

- que:
  - will you come set the example for your companions?
  ans:
  - gladly.

- que:
  - whom are you going to dance with?
  ans:
  - with you, if you will ask me.

- que:
  - indeed we're not.
  ans:
  - brother and sister?

- que:
  - what of your news?
  ans:
  - we must wait until we're at your house in front of the fireplace.

- que:
  - wasn't the ball lovely?
  ans:
  - i had the most wonderful time.

- que:
  - can you have forgotten?
  ans:
  - mr. elton cut his finger, and you urged me to bind the wound.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i was certain you were developing feelings for someone.

- que:
  - what are your options after all, jane, hmm?
  ans:
  - these sandwiches are delicious, mrs. elton.

- que:
  - now, jane  shall we all play a game?
  ans:
  - i command that we each tell miss woodhouse something entertaining.

- que:
  - i shall be sure to say three very dull things... as soon as i open my mouth, shan't i?
  ans:
  - there may be a difficulty.

- que:
  - that would be charming.
  ans:
  - whilst i pick some more strawberries?

- que:
  - how could you be so insolent to a woman of her age and situation?
  ans:
  - i'd not thought it possible.

- que:
  - how could i help saying it?
  ans:
  - i daresay she did not understand me.

- que:
  - all the way, and on such a cold night?
  ans:
  - certainly i walked.

- que:
  - my dear, how did you find my old friend and her daughter?
  ans:
  - emma has called on mrs. and miss bates.

- que:
  - when will you be back?
  ans:
  - the engagement has been in place for some time.

- que:
  - now, emma, he's a good man, however wrong this action might be.
  ans:
  - although how could he have come here and treated me in this fashion?

- que:
  - dear, might i entreat you to put mr. weston's heart at ease?
  ans:
  - he's been as worried about you as l.

- que:
  - could you let him know how glad you are for frank... to have found a girl of such steady character?
  ans:
  - here is the luckiest father in all of england!

- que:
  - can you imagine that i knew... when i was encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?
  ans:
  - had i known, i would have cautioned you.

- que:
  - wha what do you mean?
  ans:
  - you, you said that you loved a man  i did not name him, but i hope i have developed better taste than to choose frank churchill over him.

- que:
  - mr. knightley?
  ans:
  - to be sure.

- que:
  - must something be done about it?
  ans:
  - you must think him 500 million times more above me than mr. churchill.

- que:
  - have you any idea of mr. knightley's returning your affection?
  ans:
  - yes, i must say that i have.

- que:
  - this is tragic.
  ans:
  - am i wrong to hope as i do?

- que:
  - why is it tragic that harriet should attach herself... to a man who you admire so much?
  ans:
  - i love him... so dearly, so greatly.

- que:
  - and until he does, you must try to put him out of your mind.
  ans:
  - how could john let him do that?

- que:
  - can you?
  ans:
  - certainly i can.

- que:
  - why do you say that?
  ans:
  - lamb stew's his favorite.

- que:
  - dear lord, if he cannot share a life with me, is it wrong to ask that he not share it with anyone?
  ans:
  - i would be content if he would just stay single, lord.

- que:
  - happy?
  ans:
  - w well, i'm...

- que:
  - may i join you?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - of what nature is this news?
  ans:
  - the very best.

- que:
  - my wound?
  ans:
  - i know you must've been... cruelly disappointed by his secret.

- que:
  - emma, uh is that true?
  ans:
  - he imposed on me, but he has not injured me.

- que:
  - you will not ask me the point of my envy?
  ans:
  - well, perhaps you are wise.

- que:
  - but i cannot desire that.
  ans:
  - mr. knightley?

- que:
  - but why?
  ans:
  - i know i made mistakes, but had you been here the last few days... you would have seen how i have tried to change.

- que:
  - have you not wondered why i never befriended frank churchill?
  ans:
  - it was because i knew he was intended for you.

- que:
  - what of my flaws?
  ans:
  - i've humbled you and i've lectured you, and you have borne it as no one could have borne it.

- que:
  - marry me?
  ans:
  - marry me, my wonderful, darling friend.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i cannot marry you.

- que:
  - why ever not?
  ans:
  - my father.

- que:
  - miss woodhouse, may i come in?
  ans:
  - you know you need never ask.

  - cooked?
  ans:
  - i thought he was rolling in dough.

- que:
  - why do you think the new trimotor is still at the dock?

  ans:
  - no, somebody wrote me something about it.

  ans:
  - that's tough.

- que:
  - why should you?
  ans:
  - i guess you misunderstood, lady.

  - i guess if you can stand that guy, we've got no right to kick.

- que:
  - what about me?
  ans:
  - i didn't get this by walking into a door.

- que:
  - who, me?
  ans:

- que:
  - who's running this airline?
  ans:
  - geoff, please.

- que:
  - what about my passage money?
  ans:
  - you don't need it.

- que:
  - you mean, anything that's a little too tough for somebody else?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - on those terms, you still want the job?
  ans:
  - i don't know any other way i'd want it.

- que:
  - isn't that too much?
  ans:
  - not for that kind of flying.

- que:

- que:
  - you don't think i care anything about that, do you?
  ans:
  - well, i don't.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - i'd like to tell him what i think of him, that's all.

  ans:
  - the old master himself.

- que:
  - what's he doing?
  ans:
  - testing a smashed up plane that mike stuck together with a little glue.

  - you didn't tell him what a baby i was?
  ans:
  - no, i skipped that one.

- que:
  - after that sample, have you still got your chin stuck out for more?
  ans:
  - i know i'm a fool, but i can't do anything about it.

- que:
  - you don't believe that, do you?
  ans:
  - you'il have a hard time making him believe it.

- que:
  - you love him, don't you?
  ans:
  - yes, i guess i do.

- que:
  - why couldn't i be there to meet him when he gets back?
  ans:
  - why couldn't i...

- que:
  - what do you do when he doesn't come back when you expect him to?
  ans:
  - i go nuts.

- que:
  - now will you tell me what he's done?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you're 100 percent sure?
  ans:
  - passed his poly with flying colors, plus it seemed to me like he really loved her.

- que:
  - why are you so dead set against that kid?
  ans:
  - he said katie told him you'd disowned her if she ever dated a harris.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - there were so many rays in the neighborhood.

- que:
  - how about this?
  ans:
  - we've interviewed witnesses...... canvassed people who were in the bar.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - so the savages are not policemen, jim.

- que:
  - you giving us a deadline?
  ans:
  - we'il speak for katie, mr. markum.

- que:
  - yeah, you got a match?
  ans:

  - the flats?
  ans:

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - scarier than a glass of milk, right?
  ans:
  - so take me through it.

- que:
  - so, what you're saying is that it was an inside job?
  ans:
  - it had to be.

- que:
  - still have a copy of those records?
  ans:
  - yeah, it's in a box in the office there.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - this guy i fired a couple of weeks before.

- que:
  - do i look senile to you?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - you say they used the same gun for another crime?
  ans:
  - that's correct, sir.

  - where you been?
  ans:

  - what the fuck you talking about, dave?
  ans:
  - vampires, sweetie.

- que:
  - you think i killed katie?
  ans:
  - celeste.

  - henry?
  ans:
  - henry and george.

- que:
  - isn't that fucking hilarious?
  ans:
  - at least that's what they called themselves, but...... they were wolves, and dave...... was the boy who escaped from wolves.

- que:
  - what are you talking about, dave?
  ans:
  - i'm talking henry and george.

- que:
  - you mean, all those years ago...... when you were a little boy?
  ans:
  - dave...

- que:
  - i don't see it that way.
  ans:
  - what stays?

- que:
  - what does just ray's gun have to do with dave?
  ans:
  - these things get passed around.

- que:
  - katie markum was not sexually abused, see?
  ans:
  - in that equation, sexual emission is part of the deal.

- que:
  - it's cold, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah, i guess.

- que:
  - saw who?
  ans:
  - katie.

- que:

- que:
  - how about you tell us what really happened saturday night, mr. boyle?
  ans:
  - you lied.

- que:
  - hey, you think this is funny?
  ans:
  - no, i don't.

- que:
  - what blood?
  ans:
  - let's start with the front seat.

- que:
  - hey, you think i could get that sprite, sean?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - how about a meatball sub while you're at it?
  ans:
  - i ain't your bitch, dave.

- que:
  - yeah, but you're someone's bitch, aren't you, sean?
  ans:
  - the blood on your front seat, dave.

- que:
  - what is the point?
  ans:
  - we can break this open on the gun.

  - so, what do we do with dave?
  ans:

  - yeah?
  ans:

  ans:
  - and look at this.

- que:
  - joyful?
  ans:
  - most of our customers come to this town with contracts to bring peace and prosperity to the arms industry for the next 50 years.

- que:
  - but how the fuck do you peddle an arms race when the only asshole you've got to race against is yourself?
  ans:
  - the night train to leningrad.

- que:
  - i may have mentioned mr potomac books, my new american partner?
  ans:
  - well, he's doing leningrad, and he summoned me for a powwow.

- que:
  - powwow?
  ans:
  - i thought you knew english.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - it is our custom before a long journey first to sit down.

- que:
  - won't that do?
  ans:
  - well,... you are supposed to sit on your luggage and sigh a little and cross yourself.

- que:
  - are you coming back to moscow?
  ans:
  - no, not this time.

- que:
  - school?
  ans:
  - work.

- que:
  - cigarettes, scotch, drugs, currency?
  ans:
  - no, thanks.

- que:
  - you get lost?
  ans:
  - that's a good idea.

- que:
  - why don't you try it?
  ans:
  - one down, two to go.

- que:
  - where are you, dante?
  ans:
  - the only two sober people there.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - i'm very well.

- que:
  - you can walk a little?
  ans:
  - it is safest to keep moving.

- que:
  - you came to tell me you refuse to publish me?
  ans:
  - dante, you're going too fast.

- que:
  - what about her?
  ans:
  - she also chose.

- que:
  - have you forgotten your words at peredelkino?
  ans:
  - i am not the man you thought i was.

- que:
  - you like graveyards, barley?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - herr salieri?
  ans:
  - leave me alone.

- que:
  - do you know who i am?
  ans:
  - that makes no difference.

- que:
  - are they?
  ans:
  - offer me your confession.

- que:
  - how well are you trained in music?
  ans:
  - i know a little.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - here in vienna.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it was a very popular tune in its day.

- que:
  - here, how about this?
  ans:
  - this one brought down the house.

- que:
  - can you recall no melody of mine?
  ans:
  - i was the most famous composer in europe.

- que:
  - is it true?
  ans:
  - for god's sake, my son...... if you have something to confess...... do it now.

- que:
  - how could i tell him...... what music meant to me?
  ans:
  - lord...... make me a great composer.

- que:
  - in a few years, i was his court composer.
  ans:
  - and do you know what happened?

- que:
  - isn't that incredible?
  ans:
  - every night i sat right next to the emperor of austria...... playing duets with him...... correcting the royal sight reading.

- que:
  - but what did it matter?
  ans:
  - mozart is not here.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - i've stopped.

- que:
  - but i love you?
  ans:
  - tish i'm tee.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - tee... eat.

- que:
  - these viennese know good music when they hear it, don't you think?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - why must i be humiliated...... in front of my guests, by one of my own servants?
  ans:
  - the more license i allow you, the more you take.

- que:
  - why would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument?
  ans:
  - he's remarkable, majesty.

- que:
  - that?
  ans:
  - a most tiresome piece.

- que:
  - tiresome?
  ans:
  - a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.

- que:
  - we could use a good german composer in vienna, surely?
  ans:
  - i'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer.

- que:
  - what do you think, chamberlain?
  ans:
  - in my opinion, sir, it's time we had a piece in our own language.

- que:
  - kapellmeister?
  ans:
  - majesty...... i must agree with herr direktor.

- que:
  - court composer...... what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think it's an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - here we go.

- que:
  - how do you like it?
  ans:
  - they're all so beautiful.

- que:
  - gentlemen...... good morning.
  ans:
  - why don't i have three heads?

- que:
  - what do you have for me today?
  ans:
  - your majesty, herr mozart.

- que:
  - yes, what about him?
  ans:
  - he's here.

- que:
  - may i see?
  ans:
  - just a trifle.

- que:
  - may i try it?
  ans:
  - you do me too much honor.

- que:
  - yes or no?
  ans:
  - you know all these gentlemen, i'm sure.

- que:
  - which one?
  ans:
  - mio caro adone.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - well, there it is.

- que:
  - did we vote in the end for german or italian?
  ans:
  - actually, sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to italian.

- que:
  - did we?
  ans:
  - because i've already found the most wonderful libretto.

- que:
  - have i seen it?
  ans:
  - i don't think you have, herr direktor.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - in a harem, majesty.

- que:
  - you mean in turkey?
  ans:
  - yes, exactly.

- que:
  - then why especially does it have to be in german?
  ans:
  - it doesn't, especially.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - as a foreigner, i'd love to learn.

- que:
  - on one hearing only?
  ans:
  - i think so, sire.

- que:
  - or this?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - all i ever wanted...... was to sing to god.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - tell me that.

- que:
  - and then deny me the talent?
  ans:
  - it's turkish.

- que:
  - and he's been commissioned to write an opera.
  ans:
  - does he?

- que:
  - is it true?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is there a part in it for me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - in a harem.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - a brothel.

- que:
  - mozart?
  ans:
  - you might be disappointed.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - looks and talent don't always go together, caterina.

- que:
  - it is new.
  ans:
  - shall we continue?

- que:
  - it is, isn't it, sire?
  ans:
  - yes, indeed.

- que:
  - of course, now and then... just now and then...... it seemed a touch....
  ans:
  - so then, you liked it?

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - well, i mean, occasionally, it seems to have...

- que:
  - too many notes, your majesty?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - please.
  ans:
  - which few did you have in mind, majesty?

- que:
  - when do you marry?
  ans:
  - we haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.

- que:
  - excuse me...... but how old are you?
  ans:
  - my heart was filling up...... with such hatred for that little man.

- que:
  - one more chance?
  ans:
  - you have leave to try.

- que:
  - to conquer here is to conquer europe?
  ans:
  - with my wife i can do it.

- que:
  - what is your view?
  ans:
  - it's an interesting idea, majesty.

- que:
  - why must i submit samples of work to a committee to teach a 13 year old girl?
  ans:
  - his majesty wishes it.

- que:
  - is he angry with me?
  ans:
  - quite the contrary.

- que:
  - then why not appoint me to the post?
  ans:
  - you're not the only composer in vienna.

- que:
  - who is on this committee?
  ans:
  - kapellmeister bonno, count orsini rosenberg...... and of course, court composer salieri.

- que:
  - must i?
  ans:
  - well, i won't.

- que:
  - frau mozart?
  ans:
  - i've come on behalf of my husband.

- que:
  - how charming, but... why did he not come himself?
  ans:
  - he's terribly busy, sir.

- que:
  - would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
  ans:
  - while i wait.

- que:
  - then he didn't send you?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - just like your husband.
  ans:
  - do you know what these are?

- que:
  - are you sure you can't...... leave this and come back again?
  ans:
  - it's very tempting, sir.

- que:
  - originals?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - i was staring through the cage...... of those meticulous ink strokes...... at an absolute beauty.
  ans:
  - these...... are originals?

- que:
  - he's very proud of his work.
  ans:
  - it's not good?

- que:
  - you will help us?
  ans:
  - from now on we are enemies...... you and i.

- que:
  - is she not here?
  ans:
  - no, she had to help her mother.

- que:
  - why don't you get up now?
  ans:
  - she's very tired, poor creature.

- que:
  - no maid?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how is your...... financial situation?
  ans:
  - couldn't be better.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - it's wonderful.

- que:
  - that one will.
  ans:
  - who?

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - confess it.

- que:
  - i look dreadful.
  ans:
  - could you want a prettier daughter?

- que:
  - are you expecting?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - isn't it marvelous?
  ans:
  - we're delighted.

- que:
  - this calls for a feast.
  ans:
  - may i offer you some tea?

- que:
  - let's go dancing.
  ans:
  - you don't want tea, do you?

- que:
  - there's a young girl here to see you.
  ans:
  - papa loves parties, don't you?

- que:
  - what's she want?
  ans:
  - she won't talk to me.

- que:
  - are you herr mozart?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - are you playing a trick on me?
  ans:
  - i've never seen her.

- que:
  - what is ridiculous?
  ans:
  - wolfie has many admirers in vienna.

- que:
  - whoever sent you is going to pay?
  ans:
  - that's right, ma'am.

- que:
  - could you wait outside?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - we can't do anything right for you, can we?
  ans:
  - you won't have to do anything for me ever again.

- que:
  - thank you, sir.
  ans:
  - but what do you expect?

- que:
  - do any pupils come to the house?
  ans:
  - not that i've seen.

- que:
  - does he work at all?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't know that, sir.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he kept seven snuff boxes in here.

- que:
  - where does he work?
  ans:
  - i have just heard some news that may be of interest to you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - mozart is writing a new opera.

- que:
  - italian?
  ans:
  - that's not all.

- que:
  - he is setting that play to music?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what is this marriage of figaro?
  ans:
  - it's a french play, kapellmeister.

- que:
  - you're absolutely sure?
  ans:
  - gentlemen, sit down.

- que:
  - are you aware that i have declared the french play of figaro...... unsuitable for our theatre?
  ans:
  - yes, sire.

- que:
  - who told you?
  ans:
  - it is not your place to ask questions.

- que:
  - is it true?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - would you tell me why?
  ans:
  - majesty, it is only a comedy.

- que:
  - how long do you think i can sustain that?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - well...... 6?
  ans:
  - 7 minutes.

- que:
  - even with the politics taken out of it, it would still remain a vulgar farce.
  ans:
  - 8 minutes?

- que:
  - why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
  ans:
  - i am fed...... to the teeth with these...... elevated things.

- que:
  - why must we go on forever...... writing only about gods and legends?
  ans:
  - or horatius or orpheus.

- que:
  - you know how much work i did?
  ans:
  - his majesty has been...... more than patient.

- que:
  - how can i persuade you if i can't show it?
  ans:
  - that will do.

- que:
  - show how it begins?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - and do you know why?
  ans:
  - not from any oppression, no.

- que:
  - do you know what for?
  ans:
  - his bed.

- que:
  - what anger?
  ans:
  - about the ballet.

- que:
  - excuse me...... but didn't his majesty specifically...... forbid the ballet at his opera?
  ans:
  - a word with you.

- que:
  - do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
  ans:
  - it's not a ballet, it's a dance at figaro's wedding.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - taking out what you should never have put in.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it's unbelievable.

- que:
  - why bother with rosenberg?
  ans:
  - he's no friend of yours.

- que:
  - you burned the score?
  ans:
  - no, my wife took it out in time.

- que:
  - excellency...... would you?
  ans:
  - with all my heart, mozart.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - is it modern?
  ans:
  - the herr direktor...... he has removed un balletto...... that would have occurred at this place.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - it's your regulation.

- que:
  - do you like this?
  ans:
  - it's not a question of liking.

- que:
  - still, if the public doesn't like one's work...... one has to accept the fact gracefully.
  ans:
  - and then... do you know what happened?

- que:
  - but what is it they don't like?
  ans:
  - i can speak for the emperor.

- que:
  - did you like it at all?
  ans:
  - i thought it was marvelous.

- que:
  - why didn't they come?
  ans:
  - i think you overestimate our dear viennese, my friend.

- que:
  - how could i not?
  ans:
  - bravo, maestro.

- que:
  - did my work please you?
  ans:
  - i never knew that music like that was possible.

- que:
  - yes, my love?
  ans:
  - these gentlemen are from salzburg.

- que:
  - what work?
  ans:
  - a mass for the dead.

- que:
  - who's dead?
  ans:
  - a man who deserved a requiem mass...... and never got one.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am only a messenger.

- que:
  - do you accept?
  ans:
  - you'il be well paid.

- que:
  - do you accept?
  ans:
  - work fast.

- que:
  - the only thing that worried me...... was the actual killing.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - how does one kill a man?
  ans:
  - i see you brought your manager with you.

- que:
  - i'm talking about now.
  ans:
  - well, madame...... how about...... half the receipts?

- que:
  - how much will you pay him now?
  ans:
  - down payment.

- que:
  - who do you think i am, the emperor?
  ans:
  - i have to go.

- que:
  - don't answer it.
  ans:
  - why not?

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - tell him i'm not here.

- que:
  - am i interrupting something?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where's our friend?
  ans:
  - he's not here.

- que:
  - i'm sorry.
  ans:
  - is that it?

- que:
  - the vaudeville, what do you think?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - can i see it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because there's nothing to see.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - what's so intelligent about a requiem?
  ans:
  - money.

- que:
  - what's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - i'm not working there anymore.

- que:
  - what has happened?
  ans:
  - you don't know what it's like.

- que:
  - when he speaks he makes no sense.
  ans:
  - is he working?

- que:
  - is he working?
  ans:
  - i don't have it yet.

- que:
  - are you neglecting my request?
  ans:
  - i promise you.

- que:
  - i've been sick but i'm all right now, aren't i?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - can you give me one reason i can understand?
  ans:
  - it's killing me.

- que:
  - you're drunk, aren't you?
  ans:
  - pick him up.

- que:
  - is it over?
  ans:
  - she's not well either.

- que:

  ans:
  - the man.

- que:
  - can we come in?
  ans:
  - better not.

- que:
  - he's all right?
  ans:
  - yes, he's just exhausted.

- que:
  - tell him we came by, won't you?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - back to vienna.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i feel wrong.

- que:
  - where did i stop?
  ans:
  - the end of the recordare.

- que:
  - how would you translate that?
  ans:
  - consigned to flames of woe.

- que:
  - you believe in it?
  ans:
  - a fire which never dies, burning you forever.

- que:
  - is it possible?
  ans:
  - common time.

  ans:
  - well, there it is.

- que:
  - did we vote in the end for german or italian?
  ans:
  - sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to italian.

- que:
  - did we?
  ans:
  - i don't think it was really decided, your majesty.

- que:
  - why so?
  ans:
  - because i've already found the most wonderful libretto.

- que:
  - have i seen it?
  ans:
  - i don't think you have,\" herr direktor\".

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - in a harem, majesty.

- que:
  - you mean in turkey?

  - then why especially does it have to be in german?
  ans:
  - it doesn't, especially.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - it's charming.

- que:
  - excuse me, majesty, but what do you think these could be?
  ans:
  - being a foreigner, i'd love to learn.

- que:
  - on one hearing only?
  ans:
  - i think so, sire.

- que:
  - or this?
  ans:
  - this.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - grazie, signore.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - tell me that.

- que:
  - and then deny me the talent?
  ans:
  - madame cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.

- que:
  - how do you like it?
  ans:
  - it's turkish.

- que:
  - and he's been commissioned to write an opera.
  ans:
  - does he?

- que:
  - is it true?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is there a part in it for me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - in a harem.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - a brothel.

- que:
  - mozart?
  ans:
  - you might be disappointed.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - looks and talent don't always go together, katerina.

- que:
  - shall we continue?
  ans:
  - there she was.

- que:
  - it is, isn't it, sire?
  ans:
  - yes, indeed.

- que:
  - of course, now and then, just now and then...... it seemed a touch...
  ans:
  - so then, you liked it?

- que:
  - what do you mean, sire?
  ans:
  - well, i mean, occasionally, it seems to have...

- que:
  - too many notes, majesty?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - i think i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - she's the fiance of\" herr mozart\".
  ans:
  - which few did you have in mind?

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - how charming.

- que:
  - well...... when do you marry?
  ans:
  - we haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.

- que:
  - excuse me, but how old are you?
  ans:
  - 26.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - i told him that, but he won't listen to me.

- que:
  - may i...?
  ans:
  - well, there it is.

- que:
  - excuse me.
  ans:
  - wolfie, will you get some water?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the marriage.

- que:
  - what does it matter to you?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - how was i?
  ans:
  - you were sublime.

- que:
  - and what did you think of the music?
  ans:
  - extremely clever.

- que:
  - is that woman still lying on the floor?
  ans:
  - no, she's fine.

- que:
  - it's the best music in vienna today, don't you agree?
  ans:
  - she must be dazzling in bed.

- que:
  - can we go home?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - won't you introduce us, wolfgang?
  ans:
  - it's very possible.

- que:
  - why choose mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
  ans:
  - my heart was filling up...... with such hatred for that little man.

- que:
  - give him one more chance?
  ans:
  - you have leave to try.

- que:
  - what is your view?
  ans:
  - it's an interesting idea, majesty, but...

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - my concern is to protect you...... from any hint of favoritism.

- que:
  - why must i submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?
  ans:
  - because his majesty wishes it.

- que:
  - is the emperor angry with me?
  ans:
  - quite the contrary.

- que:
  - then why not appoint me to the post?
  ans:
  - you are not the only composer in vienna.

- que:
  - who is on this committee?
  ans:
  - young man...... the issue is quite simple.

- que:
  - must i?
  ans:
  - well, i won't.

- que:
  - do you want me to beg on the streets?
  ans:
  - don't be stupid.

- que:
  - i know how things work in this city.
  ans:
  - what's wrong with that?

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - excuse me, sir.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - she didn't say, but she says it's urgent.

- que:
  - frau mozart?
  ans:
  - i've come on behalf of my husband.

- que:
  - how charming, but why did he not come himself?
  ans:
  - well, he's terribly busy, sir.

- que:
  - would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
  ans:
  - while i wait.

- que:
  - then he didn't send you?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - just like your husband.
  ans:
  - do you know what these are?

- que:
  - are you sure you can't...... leave this and come back again?
  ans:
  - it's very tempting, sir.

- que:
  - originals?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - i was staring through the cage...... of those meticulous ink strokes...... at an absolute beauty.
  ans:
  - these...... are originals?

- que:
  - is it not good?
  ans:
  - it is miraculous.

- que:
  - so you will help us?
  ans:
  - i dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.

- que:
  - tonight?
  ans:
  - alone.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - some service deserves service in return.

- que:
  - isn't it obvious?
  ans:
  - that lady is back, sir.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - i'm here.

- que:
  - should we stay here?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - or don't we need to bother anymore?
  ans:
  - suppose we don't, really.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - tell me.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - one of my own pupils, a very young singer...... maria theresa paradis...... told me she was...

- que:
  - well, what?
  ans:
  - molested, majesty.

- que:
  - whom did they choose?
  ans:
  - herr zummer.

- que:
  - without pupils, i can't manage.
  ans:
  - herr zummer?

- que:
  - you don't mean you're living in poverty?
  ans:
  - no, but i'm broke.

- que:
  - well, how is this possible?
  ans:
  - i hear your concerts are quite successful.

- que:
  - seriously...... is there any chance you could manage a loan?
  ans:
  - only for six months.

- que:
  - you expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?
  ans:
  - as a matter of fact, i do.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it's cream cheese mixed with sugar...... suffused with rum.

- que:
  - what exactly are you working on?
  ans:
  - really, i can't say.

- que:
  - which of them do you wish me to teach?
  ans:
  - that's funny.

- que:
  - right,\" herr mozart\"?
  ans:
  - perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.

- que:
  - goodbye, sir.
  ans:
  - why don't you let me try?

- que:
  - am i not welcome?
  ans:
  - of course, welcome.

- que:
  - doesn't your wife feed you?
  ans:
  - no, she had to help her mother.

- que:
  - why don't you get up now, my darling?
  ans:
  - she's very tired, poor creature.

- que:
  - don't you have a maid?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - how is your...... financial situation?
  ans:
  - couldn't be better.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - it's wonderful.

- que:
  - that one will.
  ans:
  - who?

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - it's a secret.

- que:
  - secret?
  ans:
  - now, papa, confess it.

- que:
  - i look dreadful.
  ans:
  - could you want a prettier daughter?

- que:
  - are you...... expecting?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - isn't it marvelous?
  ans:
  - we're delighted.

- que:
  - this calls for a feast.
  ans:
  - may i offer you some tea?

- que:
  - let's go dancing.
  ans:
  - you don't want tea, do you?

- que:
  - before i leave this earth...... i will laugh at you.
  ans:
  - papa loves parties, don't you?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - there's a young girl here to see you.

- que:
  - what does she want?
  ans:
  - she won't talk to me.

- que:
  - are you\" herr mozart\"?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - are you playing a trick on me?
  ans:
  - i've never seen this girl.

- que:
  - is this some kind of joke?
  ans:
  - wolfie has many admirers in vienna.

- que:
  - whoever sent you is going to pay?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - could you please wait outside?
  ans:
  - yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - we can't do anything right for you, can we?
  ans:
  - you won't have to do anything for me ever again.

- que:
  - are you aware that i have declared the french play\" figaro\"...... unsuitable for our theater?
  ans:
  - yes, sire.

- que:
  - who told you this, majesty?
  ans:
  - it is not your place to ask questions.

- que:
  - is it true?
  ans:
  - yes, i...

- que:
  - would you tell me why?
  ans:
  - majesty, it is only a comedy.

- que:
  - how long do you think i can sustain that?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - eight minutes?
  ans:
  - twenty, sire.

- que:
  - why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
  ans:
  - i am fed to the teeth with these...... elevated things.

- que:
  - why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?
  ans:
  - because they do.

- que:
  - do you know how much work went into it?
  ans:
  - his majesty has been more than patient,\" signore\".

- que:
  - how can i persuade if i can't show it?
  ans:
  - that will do,\" herr mozart\".

- que:
  - just that?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:

  ans:
  - his bed.

- que:
  - what anger?
  ans:
  - about the ballet.

- que:

  ans:
  - it's not a ballet, it's a dance.

- que:
  - what are you doing,\" herr direktor\"?
  ans:
  - taking out what you should never have put in.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it's unbelievable.

- que:
  - can't you talk to him?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - why bother?
  ans:
  - he's no friend of yours.

- que:
  - you burned the score?
  ans:
  - no, my wife took it out in time.

- que:
  - excellency...... would you?
  ans:
  - with all my heart, mozart.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - is it modern?
  ans:
  - majesty...... the\" herr direktor\"...... he has removed\" un balletto\"...... that would have occurred at this place.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - it is your regulation, sire.

- que:
  - do you like this?
  ans:
  - it's not a question of liking, majesty.

- que:
  - making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.
  ans:
  - can we see the scene with the music, please?

- que:
  - still, if the public doesn't like one's work...... one has to accept the fact gracefully.
  ans:
  - and then, do you know what happened?

- que:
  - but what is it that they don't like?
  ans:
  - i can speak for the emperor.

- que:
  - did you like it at all?
  ans:
  - i think you overestimate our dear viennese, friend.

- que:
  - how could i not?
  ans:
  - bravo, maestro.

- que:
  - did my work please you?
  ans:
  - i never knew that music like that was possible.

  - salzburg?
  ans:

- que:
  - herr mozart\"?
  ans:

- que:
  - who is dead?
  ans:
  - a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one.

- que:

  - i am only a messenger.

- que:
  - do you accept?

- que:
  - do you accept?
  ans:
  - work fast.

- que:
  - wolfie?
  ans:

- que:
  - the only thing that worried me was the actual killing.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - how does one kill a man?
  ans:
  - it's one thing...... to dream about it.

- que:
  - i'm talking about now.
  ans:

- que:
  - how much will you pay him now?
  ans:
  - down payment.

- que:
  - who do you think i am, the emperor?
  ans:
  - i have to go.

- que:
  - it's embarrassing.
  ans:
  - why not?

- que:
  - can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?
  ans:
  - your pupil is married and living in mannheim, young man.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - if a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - tell him...

  - where's our friend?
  ans:

- que:
  - i'm sorry.
  ans:
  - is that it?

- que:
  - the vaudeville, what do you think?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - can i see it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because there's nothing to see.

- que:
  - and that's a good thing?
  ans:
  - you know, maybe you should get some rest.

- que:
  - sir, i have always wondered, why sue?
  ans:
  - you could have any other woman in the world.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, bad shrimp.

  ans:

  - you are never gonna believe what just happened to me.
  ans:
  - what do you mean, you can't?

  - what?
  ans:
  - the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna.

  - debs?
  ans:
  - it's me.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - i'm over here.

- que:
  - don't come any closer for a sec, okay?
  ans:
  - it's gonna be a bit of a shock.

  - debs... remember when we used to say... together forever no matter what?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - everybody all right?
  ans:
  - i saw him.

  - what's the worst that could happen?
  ans:
  - hey, little guy.

  ans:
  - sue.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna need therapy.

- que:
  - we got through, didn't we?
  ans:
  - just find ben.

- que:
  - stay here, okay?
  ans:
  - i'm coming.

- que:
  - where are your ears?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna go talk to them.

- que:
  - which one of you is the leader?
  ans:
  - that would be me.

- que:
  - is it true you can fly?
  ans:
  - i was planning to use the publicity.

- que:
  - do you know how much money i've invested in this company?
  ans:
  - victor, stop.

- que:
  - is all that for you, dr. richards?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid so.

- que:
  - how come ben can't turn it on and off like we can?
  ans:
  - that's what we're here to find out.

- que:
  - you mean, like, we won't be able to turn it off, either?
  ans:
  - that would save time.

- que:
  - is that a trick question?
  ans:
  - grow up.

- que:
  - am i the only guy who thinks this is cool?
  ans:
  - we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes... and figure out how to reverse them.

- que:
  - so, what do you think?
  ans:
  - i don't know, reed, i think you might be bringing your work home with you.

- que:
  - what about the rumours of a takeover?
  ans:
  - god, i was so worried about you.

- que:
  - victor, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i'm starting to wonder the same thing.

- que:
  - how much do you know about what happened to you?
  ans:
  - not much.

- que:
  - didn't go as planned?
  ans:
  - it was a catastrophe.

- que:
  - abort?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why didn't you just say so?
  ans:
  - his internal organs are completely solid.

- que:
  - how bad is it?
  ans:
  - you know, i used to smoke.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - i'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.

- que:
  - can you remember your exact emotions on the bridge?
  ans:
  - anger.

- que:
  - is there any way to duplicate that feeling?
  ans:
  - some memory or...

- que:
  - you feel anything?
  ans:
  - nope.

- que:
  - how's that coming?
  ans:
  - i'm so sorry.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah, fine.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what was so complicated about that?
  ans:
  - there were a lot of variables to consider.

- que:
  - do you feel anything right now?
  ans:
  - hey, guys.

- que:
  - so what's the prognosis?
  ans:
  - your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing.

- que:
  - and it's changing into?
  ans:
  - i don't really know.

- que:
  - how long?
  ans:
  - at this rate, the infection could be complete in two, maybe three weeks.

- que:
  - what do you mean complete?
  ans:
  - i wish i could tell you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - centre for disease control.

- que:
  - can i help you, buddy?
  ans:
  - oh, my.

- que:
  - johnny, can you put that napkin out?
  ans:
  - jesus.

- que:
  - how're you going to cure us?
  ans:
  - i'm going to build a machine to recreate the storm.

- que:
  - what, no pop ups?
  ans:
  - lf i can reverse the wave signal...

- que:
  - but what are the risks?
  ans:
  - even a small miscalculation could increase our symptoms exponentially... or perhaps even kill us.

- que:
  - that's bad, right?
  ans:
  - i say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys.

- que:
  - so how long till this contraption's up and running?
  ans:
  - i don't know, it's hard to say.

- que:
  - how long, reed?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you don't know?
  ans:
  - you don't want this to get worse.

- que:
  - worse than that?
  ans:
  - guys, look, we're gonna be stuck here for a while, so let's just try and get along.

- que:
  - about the ipo, no hard feelings, right?
  ans:
  - nothing personal.

- que:
  - flame boy never listens.
  ans:
  - where's your hot sister and the monster?

- que:
  - yeah, it's sort of armani meets astronaut.
  ans:
  - what did he do to his uniform?

- que:
  - so what are your superhero names?
  ans:
  - they call me the human torch.

- que:
  - what do you call that thing?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you gave us names?
  ans:
  - you don't think.

- que:
  - we need to be careful until we're normal again.
  ans:
  - so now you're the face of the fantastic four?

- que:
  - no, ben.
  ans:
  - what if i don't wanna be normal?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you need to control yourself and think before you act.

- que:
  - you know what, reed?
  ans:
  - this is who we are.

- que:
  - together?
  ans:
  - susie, look at me.

- que:
  - can i?
  ans:
  - careful.

  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i was worried about you.

- que:
  - you were worried about me?
  ans:
  - that's sweet.

- que:
  - reed?
  ans:
  - i was just resting my eyes.

- que:
  - when are the next tests?
  ans:
  - i've run out of plans.

- que:

  ans:
  - god, i was nervous.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i gave him $20.

- que:
  - well, why didn't you say something?
  ans:
  - reed, i'm saying it now.

- que:
  - you know what i mean, scarface?
  ans:
  - i'm just saying i know what it's like to lose something that you love... to see it slip away and know it's never coming back.

- que:
  - reed is gonna fix me up, okay?
  ans:
  - for your sake i hope you're right.

- que:
  - so what possible reason could he have for taking his time?
  ans:
  - i mean, other than spending more time with sue.

- que:
  - do you also remember what you swore to do... with every breath in your body?
  ans:
  - we're working as hard as we can.

- que:
  - victor?
  ans:
  - that was the prototype.

- que:
  - johnny, have you seen ben?
  ans:
  - yeah, sunshine just left.

- que:
  - you're calling that the real world?
  ans:
  - sue, stop.

- que:
  - don't talk to me like i'm a little boy, okay?
  ans:
  - maybe i would if you stopped acting like one.

- que:
  - why is everyone on my ass?
  ans:
  - if you guys are jealous, that's fine.

- que:
  - you live your life, i'il live mine.
  ans:
  - you really think those people out there care about you?

- que:
  - oh, my god, reed.

  - do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?
  ans:
  - victor, you always thought you were a god.

- que:
  - damn, i've been waiting to do that.
  ans:
  - did you say goodbye to your brother johnny?

  ans:
  - now, that big ass mother fucker back at the cornfield... all right, that's who we should be afraid of.

- que:

  ans:
  - nothing personal, but the scooby van out back... wasn't exactly subtle.

  - cause somebody's definitely breaking... the fucking reality rules, ok?
  ans:
  - it makes sense in a way.

- que:
  - how can we use that?
  ans:
  - i think we should concentrate on jason first.

- que:
  - shouldn't we go after him first?
  ans:
  - i don't know, maybe what we need to do is... to offer freddy a sacrifice.

- que:
  - like a virgin, right?

  - why would he want to when he can fuck somebody like me?
  ans:
