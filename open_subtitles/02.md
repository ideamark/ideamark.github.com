- que:
  - what were the words he wrote?
  ans:
  - all under heaven.

- que:
  - do you know why?
  ans:
  - to guard against assassins.

- que:
  - how should i reward you?
  ans:
  - my service was for qin, not for a reward.

- que:
  - how did you defeat such opponents?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - flying snow had an affair with sky.

- que:
  - why haven't i heard this before?
  ans:
  - i went to great lengths to uncover it.

- que:
  - what did you use to defeat sky?
  ans:
  - this is my territory.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - you are on the king's most wanted list.

- que:
  - was your sword swifter than theirs combined?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how did you do it, then?
  ans:
  - disguised as a citizen of zhao.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i'm from yi county in the kingdom of zhao.

- que:
  - which calligrapher do you seek?
  ans:
  - i respectfully request master highcliff.

- que:
  - what do you want written?
  ans:
  - sword.

- que:
  - you are fond of the sword?
  ans:
  - it was my father's dying wish.

- que:
  - what size scroll?
  ans:
  - eight feet.

- que:
  - did you hear me, master springbrook?
  ans:
  - master highcliff wants to borrow red ink.

- que:
  - could i have some red ink?
  ans:
  - they drew strength from their calligraphy.

- que:
  - master springbrook.
  ans:
  - wouldn't that be ideal?

- que:
  - why are you going outside?
  ans:
  - to fend off the arrows.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i've traveled here to deliver an item.

- que:
  - it would reveal his swordsmanship?
  ans:
  - but it's just an ordinary word.

- que:
  - did you discover it?
  ans:
  - it eluded me.

- que:
  - so how did you challenge them?
  ans:
  - although they hadn't spoken in three years they spied on each other.

- que:
  - sky died by your sword?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - i'm from the kingdom of qin.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - flying snow.

- que:
  - why do you laugh?
  ans:
  - what you did last night was stupid.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - me.

- que:
  - would you like my impression of them?
  ans:
  - three years ago they stormed the palace.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - he permitted it.

- que:
  - what convinced him you could succeed where he had failed?
  ans:
  - you have trained, perhaps for 10 years with one goal, my assassination.

- que:
  - so why seek out broken sword and flying snow?
  ans:
  - i surmise that your skill requires you to come within 10 paces.

- que:
  - how far am i from the bookshelves?
  ans:
  - about 10 paces.

- que:
  - did i hurt you too much?
  ans:
  - i should be the one who fights him.

- que:
  - if you died, how could i live?
  ans:
  - you will live on, promise me.

- que:
  - what are you here for?
  ans:
  - for what you once said.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - he and she are bound in life and death.

- que:
  - a citizen of qin would not do this.
  ans:
  - how did you uncover my plan?

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - a man of zhao.

- que:
  - however you too have underestimated someone.
  ans:
  - what is that?

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - broken sword.

- que:
  - how is sky now?
  ans:
  - fully recovered.

- que:
  - what went wrong?
  ans:
  - i abandoned the plan.

- que:
  - he said that?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i also asked him.

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - your special medicine should heal his wounds in a day.

- que:
  - have you delivered it?
  ans:
  - i tended to the wound myself.

- que:
  - how is flying snow?
  ans:
  - she is resting.

- que:
  - doesn't qin want to conquer zhao?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - isn't the king the enemy of zhao?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you call yourself a man of zhao?
  ans:
  - flying snow has asked me that too.

- que:
  - was your sword forged in hatred?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how can i dissuade you?
  ans:
  - only by killing me.

- que:
  - are you that determined?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why did you want to do that?
  ans:
  - i wanted to follow the example of my master and to persuade you with my life.

- que:
  - what were the words he wrote?
  ans:
  - all under heaven...

- que:
  - he must have abandoned the mission.
  ans:
  - i would like to know how you mean to kill me without your sword?

- que:
  - what did you say to him?
  ans:
  - i wrote three words.

- que:
  - what words?
  ans:
  - all under heaven.

- que:
  - how can i convince you?
  ans:
  - draw your sword.

- que:
  - why didn't you fend off my sword?
  ans:
  - so that you'd believe me.

- que:
  - why didn't you?
  ans:
  - no more drifting, no more roaming.

- que:
  - permission to execute?
  ans:
  - he conspired to assassinate your majesty.

- que:
  - blimey o'reilly fred.
  ans:
  - he in my bloody room again?

- que:

  ans:
  - have you been using your mother's...... cups and saucers for your bloody experiments?

- que:
  - me?

- que:
  - private?
  ans:
  - women's private.

- que:
  - you are not pregnant, are you?
  ans:

- que:
  - you didn't tell me about that stuff.
  ans:
  - what was she mixing?

- que:
  - how was i supposed to know about it?
  ans:
  - i knew there would be some who would want to stand in my way.

- que:
  - he's a gp, you see?
  ans:
  - no, he isn't.

- que:

  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - what you do to me?
  ans:

  ans:
  - we'd a terrible one last summer.

- que:
  - was anybody hurt?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:

  ans:
  - i've given her some soothing medicine for her tummy...

- que:
  - would you not sneak up on people like that?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - what's turned you into an angel all of a sudden?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:

  ans:
  - looks like a bloody funeral director.

- que:
  - been out courting, nephew?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid i don't have time for anything but my work these days, auntie.

- que:
  - so what's your diagnosis on all this then graham?
  ans:
  - well, dr. scott seems to think it's some kind of nervous stomach disorder...... but i'm exploring other avenues.

- que:
  - and you say she bought it from boots?
  ans:
  - oh, you've no idea how many lethal products are sold over the counter these days, auntie.

- que:
  - well, they're normally very good, aren't they?
  ans:
  - they do these wine making kits now.

- que:
  - aren't you, graham?
  ans:
  - suspicion had been voiced.

- que:
  - pull yourself together, will you?
  ans:
  - i'm going to find out what's behind this if i have to tear the house apart.

- que:
  - you did, didn't you?
  ans:
  - don't think i'll be here to look after you.

- que:
  - christ, just look at her, will you?
  ans:
  - i don't reckon she even knows who we are anymore.

- que:
  - yes she has, haven't you mum?
  ans:
  - she hasn't, you know.

- que:
  - have you been to the toilet for solids, in the past 24 hours, mother?
  ans:
  - for solids, not just pee pee.

- que:
  - she's trying to tell us something.
  ans:
  - for god's sake, can't you see?

- que:
  - is it the medicine?
  ans:
  - what she's trying to say is...... she wants us to give it to her.

- que:
  - what the hell are we supposed to do?
  ans:
  - don't tell me to piss off.

- que:
  - may i help you to some pickle, uncle jack?
  ans:
  - yeah, go on.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - same symptoms as your mum.

- que:
  - stroke of bad luck that, isn't it?
  ans:
  - think i heard everyone in your street has come down with some bug or other.

- que:
  - have you any idea where he is?
  ans:
  - he's not here at the moment.

- que:
  - was it you who called?
  ans:
  - pink card, mr. trent.

- que:
  - fourteen years old, eh?
  ans:
  - welcome to harshhurst, son.

- que:
  - mummy?
  ans:
  - he was about to relive this episode for the second time that night.

- que:
  - perhaps this new bloke might be able to do something for me.
  ans:
  - did you never have this, graham... your mum, visions and that?

- que:
  - what new bloke?
  ans:
  - i heard in the office we are getting a new senior... psy... chologist...... chiatrist.

- que:
  - have any of them had any kind of...... individual treatment since they arrived?
  ans:
  - doctor zeigler, these patients are not labelled chronic simply for our convenience.

- que:
  - so, all of these men are classified as psychopaths?
  ans:
  - moral imbeciles to a man.

- que:
  - what's your name, boy?
  ans:
  - berridge, sir.

- que:
  - and why are you here, berridge?
  ans:
  - i killed my parents, sir.

- que:
  - and if you had your time over, would you do it again?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - why do you think you would not do it again?
  ans:
  - because they'd send me back to this place, sir.

- que:
  - did you speak, boy?
  ans:
  - sorry, sir, but vulpes means wolf, sir.

- que:
  - are you going to cure me, sir?
  ans:
  - sit down, please.

- que:
  - do you think i'll ever get out?
  ans:
  - i don't think we should speculate on these things just at the moment.

- que:
  - do you think that you're up to it?
  ans:
  - i want to live rightly and lovingly, sir.

- que:
  - and what do you think has prevented you from doing so up until now?
  ans:
  - i don't know, sir.

- que:
  - and you always believe what doctor triefus says to you?
  ans:
  - maybe you'll allow me to be the judge of that from now on.

- que:
  - how so, sir?
  ans:
  - well, i like to think that our...... emotional functions are not unlike our...... limbs, our organs, they can be broken, damaged.

- que:
  - you're going to fix me, sir?
  ans:
  - well, it's not just going to be up to me.

- que:
  - how will you know i'm not faking it?
  ans:
  - because...

- que:
  - d'you see?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna be with you on this journey.

- que:
  - you'd like me to tell you my dreams, sir?
  ans:
  - yes, i want you to... write them down.

- que:
  - will you do that for me?
  ans:
  - i think it's a wonderful idea, sir.

- que:
  - what do you think this is trying to tell us?
  ans:
  - i think it's trying to tell us that we're wasting our time.

- que:
  - do you have any idea how much trouble i've gone to on your behalf?
  ans:
  - there's 700 men in this institution...... i've got the impossible task of selecting a handful...... with whom i can find the time to work.

- que:
  - you what?

  ans:
  - i gotta keep moving.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - there are traps.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - because of this.

- que:
  - are you a doctor?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't trust you.

- que:
  - clues to who built this place?
  ans:
  - i think that's just a coincidence.

- que:
  - what do they mean?
  ans:
  - i think it's a mistake to think of these letters as meaning something.

- que:
  - we should make a map.
  ans:
  - a puzzle?

- que:
  - our blood?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you got a better idea?
  ans:
  - i have a better idea.

- que:
  - you're gonna ride in on your white horse and whisk her out?
  ans:
  - the rooms can realign to zero position.

- que:
  - and what's the first thing the program does when the rooms realign to zero position?
  ans:
  - clean sweep.

- que:
  - don't you ever feel?
  ans:
  - son, you're outta line.

- que:

  ans:
  - we don't even know what the letters mean yet.

- que:
  - well isn't that how you plot coordinates on a graph?
  ans:
  - x coordinate, comma, y coordinate, comma, z coordinate.

- que:
  - what fact?
  ans:
  - there are only 26 letters in the english alphabet.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - so we know the parameters.

- que:
  - what is it now?
  ans:
  - please tell me that's not...

- que:
  - would you put that away?
  ans:
  - there's no consent form.

- que:
  - you think they're gonna stop this whole operation because you lost a piece of paper?
  ans:
  - i didn't lose it.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - told you i recognized her.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:

  ans:
  - and the rules clearly state that two senior technicians have to be present at all exit procedures.

- que:
  - we?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - when will you let them know?
  ans:
  - as soon as we're done with this.

  ans:
  - why can't we remember anything?

- que:
  - blank slate?
  ans:
  - bastards, you've been using us as lab rats.

- que:
  - you're job?
  ans:
  - how can you do this to people.

- que:
  - and you believed them?
  ans:
  - well it was either this or execution so...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - they say you're all condemned prisoners, who volunteer for the experiment instead of facing the death penalty.

- que:
  - while you were doing your system checks, did you happen to see a little girl?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't trust you.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - c i a.

- que:
  - clues to who built this place?
  ans:
  - i think that's just a coincidence.

- que:
  - what do they mean?
  ans:
  - i think it's a mistake to think of these letters as meaning something.

- que:
  - we should make a map.
  ans:
  - a puzzle?

- que:
  - our blood?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you got a better idea?
  ans:
  - i have a better idea.

- que:
  - you're gonna ride in on your white horse and whisk her out?
  ans:
  - the rooms can realign to zero position.

- que:
  - and what's the first thing the program does when the rooms realign to zero position?
  ans:
  - clean sweep.

- que:
  - don't you ever feel?
  ans:
  - son, you're outta line.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - we're waiting for orders, it's what we do best.

- que:
  - do i look like i'm kidding?
  ans:
  - this one's s d f.

- que:
  - okay, so they're commas.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - what difference does it make?
  ans:
  - we don't even know what the letters mean yet.

- que:
  - well isn't that how you plot coordinates on a graph?
  ans:
  - x coordinate, comma, y coordinate, comma, z coordinate.

- que:
  - what fact?
  ans:
  - there are only 26 letters in the english alphabet.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - so we know the parameters.

- que:
  - what is it now?
  ans:
  - please tell me that's not...

- que:
  - would you put that away?
  ans:
  - there's no consent form.

- que:
  - you think they're gonna stop this whole operation because you lost a piece of paper?
  ans:
  - i didn't lose it.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - told you i recognized her.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i mean, there might not be a consent form.

- que:
  - get it?
  ans:
  - but that's illegal.

- que:
  - and how are we gonna do that?
  ans:
  - call up.

- que:
  - well what do you think this is?
  ans:
  - i don't see a fire.

- que:
  - what if it's all bogus?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - it's for you.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - sir.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - the exit procedure.

- que:
  - that's right my friend, but owen is not here, is he?
  ans:
  - and the rules clearly state that two senior technicians have to be present at all exit procedures.

- que:
  - we?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - when will you let them know?
  ans:
  - as soon as we're done with this.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - what do i do?
  ans:
  - just follow my lead.

- que:
  - please state your name.
  ans:
  - hello?

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - he doesn't recognise your voice.

- que:
  - please answer yes or no.
  ans:
  - do you believe in god?

- que:
  - what kind of god would do this to people?
  ans:
  - please answer yes or no.

- que:
  - i need a doctor.
  ans:
  - okay?

- que:
  - what does it do?
  ans:
  - he...

- que:
  - what happens if you push yes?
  ans:
  - owen is...

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - you're not allowed in there.

- que:
  - may we?
  ans:
  - the boys upstairs felt you could perhaps use a hand, and so, here we are.

- que:
  - yes mr. codd?
  ans:
  - it's dodd, sir.

- que:
  - what do...?
  ans:
  - yes i almost forgot i have your orders from upstairs.

- que:
  - you do know what that means?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - have we got a visual yet?
  ans:
  - still working on it, sir.

- que:
  - do you think it means anything?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do they have to?
  ans:
  - she can't be that far.

- que:
  - that we'll cut our loses?
  ans:
  - uh, guys.

- que:
  - are we sure this room is safe?
  ans:
  - maybe he just starved to death.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - we could use these.

- que:
  - it's true isn't it?
  ans:
  - i mean they now put bio receivers in all you army boys.

- que:
  - is she all right?
  ans:
  - she's not moving.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - rise and shine...

- que:
  - is she...?
  ans:
  - there's a pulse.

- que:
  - can you hear me?
  ans:
  - oh my god.

- que:
  - what happened to you?
  ans:
  - help...

- que:
  - nothing.
  ans:
  - why, you think...?

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i think whatever was eating away at her, is spreading to him.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - your face.

- que:
  - you wanna baby sit a dead man?
  ans:
  - be my guest.

- que:
  - anything?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - problem, mr. scrod?
  ans:
  - no problem sir.

- que:
  - anything of interest?
  ans:
  - actually sir, i was about to...

- que:
  - would you care to share with the rest of the class?
  ans:
  - yes sir.

- que:
  - who says they only hire the mentally challenged down here?
  ans:
  - open.

- que:
  - i always assumed that it was so they could have a blank slate to work with.
  ans:
  - why can't we remember anything?

- que:
  - blank slate?
  ans:
  - bastards, you've been using us as lab rats.

- que:
  - you're job?
  ans:
  - how can you do this to people.

- que:
  - and you believed them?
  ans:
  - well it was either this or execution so...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - they say you're all condemned prisoners, who volunteer for the experiment instead of facing the death penalty.

- que:
  - while you were doing your system checks, did you happen to see a little girl?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - they can see into our dreams?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i can show you the exits.

- que:
  - go ahead, where are they?
  ans:
  - you were wrong about the cube.

- que:
  - how do we get to that one?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - can you show us how to avoid the traps?
  ans:
  - yes, definitely.

- que:
  - mr. finn, could you do something about that, please?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - the hell...?
  ans:
  - damn.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - the letters.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - they're all gone.

- que:
  - let's make their life a little more interesting, shall we?
  ans:
  - okay...

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - really glad you showed up to help.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i think we should keep getting together and doing this more often.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - sir.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - you heard the man.

- que:
  - now what do we do?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what the hell?
  ans:
  - i don't know sir, we suddenly lost contact.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - maybe the energy required for the test itself blew out the capacitor.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - you wouldn't lie to me, now would you mr. clodd?
  ans:
  - no sir.

- que:
  - excuse me, sir.
  ans:
  - questions?

- que:
  - for the love of god, where do they find these people?
  ans:
  - i don't think it's software, sir.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i needn't remind you gentlemen, that in a few minutes we'll have no choice but to send people in there.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - boot.

- que:
  - power go out?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what's the bad news?
  ans:
  - it's gone into reset mode.

- que:
  - is that as bad as it sounds?
  ans:
  - the clean sweep program flash incinerates anything still living in all the rooms.

- que:
  - which way do we go?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - dodd is the only one who can power down this quickly.
  ans:
  - so i guess we just keep going in the same direction until we get to the edge, right?

- que:
  - but he knows that reset would kick in, so why would he...?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - quick.

- que:
  - may i have that widget back, please?
  ans:
  - i don't think i can do that, sir.

- que:
  - mr. dodd, are you disobeying a direct order?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - anyone?
  ans:
  - that the central coupling.

- que:
  - is he not?
  ans:
  - yes sir, that would be haskell, the big fellow.

  ans:
  - of course.

  ans:
  - almost.

- que:

  ans:
  - haskell?

- que:
  - how much further?
  ans:
  - sir, we've got the grid display back.

- que:
  - did we get them?
  ans:
  - sorry sir.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - well, we've decided on a few modifications before putting you back inside.

- que:
  - you have already made your choice.
  ans:
  - don't i get a choice?

- que:
  - i believe this is your signature?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

  ans:
  - five seconds.

- que:
  - that's enough time to make a call?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - how do i get ahold of you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - three... maybe four months.

- que:
  - why are we listening to arzt?
  ans:
  - because i'm a doctor and you're a hillbilly.

- que:
  - what's that mean?
  ans:
  - it means, when the monsoon season hits, the trade winds are gonna shift to the south.

- que:
  - can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that's south of us?
  ans:
  - antarctica.

- que:
  - so when do we have to leave?

  ans:
  - diane's dying of cancer.

- que:
  - so any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car?
  ans:
  - i need your help.

- que:
  - how much further?
  ans:
  - we're almost there.

- que:
  - wanna tell me where we're going, sayid?
  ans:
  - it's better that you see it for yourself.

- que:
  - open mind about what?
  ans:
  - my god.

- que:
  - what is this thing?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - you mind?
  ans:
  - sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - doesn't matter what i know, i built it.

- que:
  - sorry?
  ans:
  - michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - your only chance of running's getting on that raft, ain't it?
  ans:
  - lf we get picked up by a ship, when they come back to rescue the rest of y'all, gonna be a nice big asterisk next to your name.

- que:
  - so, what were you and sawyer arguing about?
  ans:
  - i told him something he didn't want to hear.

- que:
  - when we get rescued, we're gonna come back for everybody else, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - can't we fly around and look for it?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - dad?
  ans:
  - ooh.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - three weeks, give or take.

- que:
  - all due respect, jack, but since when do i report to you?
  ans:
  - all due respect, john, but you lied.

- que:
  - how long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know?
  ans:
  - you used your best discretion.

- que:
  - you want to open it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you notice anything about this hatch?
  ans:
  - there's no handle.

- que:
  - could the reason for that be more obvious?
  ans:
  - maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside.

- que:
  - what'd you eat today?
  ans:
  - fruit, fish.

- que:
  - drinking enough water?
  ans:
  - two, three bottles.

- que:
  - where are you getting that water from?
  ans:
  - the caves, like everybody else.

- que:
  - you try not to move too much, okay?
  ans:
  - we have to launch that raft tomorrow.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - hey, adam.

- que:
  - hey, listen, can you carve out some time for me on the mrl?
  ans:
  - yeah, it's... it's a favor for a friend of a friend.

  - how old is he?
  ans:
  - twenty two months next week.

- que:

- que:
  - heatstroke?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - raw fish?
  ans:
  - michael and jin are on the same diet.

- que:
  - so you think it was the water?
  ans:
  - no, i don't think it was the water.

- que:
  - feeling any better?
  ans:
  - cramps are quieting down.

- que:
  - you and locke kiss and make up?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - drink from that one.

- que:
  - somebody did this to me?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - michael and jin getting along?
  ans:
  - they fight like a married couple building a raft together.

- que:
  - you told him?
  ans:
  - he thinks sawyer might've done it.

- que:
  - kate?
  ans:
  - yeah, i guess she wants on the raft.

- que:
  - why would kate poison michael?
  ans:
  - well, you know, the whole fugitive thing.

- que:
  - how am i supposed to keep straight who knows what?
  ans:
  - steve didn't know about the polar bear.

- que:
  - what did she do?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you didn't think the others should know about this?
  ans:
  - discretion, john.

- que:
  - so, what's the first thing you're gonna do when we get rescued?
  ans:
  - you know, i don't really know.

- que:
  - how's michael?
  ans:
  - he's gonna be fine.

- que:
  - ls somebody gonna be taking his place on the raft?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he's not sick.

- que:
  - do you really think i'm capable of that?
  ans:
  - i don't know what you're capable of.

- que:
  - you brought beer?
  ans:
  - no self respecting man in lowa goes anywhere without beer.

- que:
  - is it on?
  ans:
  - because it's cool, katie.

- que:
  - how do you know we'll be together?
  ans:
  - you'll be a mom

- que:
  - funny how things turn out, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i had a little accident.

- que:
  - does it hurt?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - something you wanna tell me, walt?
  ans:
  - i didn't do it.

- que:
  - didn't do what?
  ans:
  - i didn't tell on you before, and i'm not gonna now.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - don't open it.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - don't open it, mr. locke.

- que:
  - wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before takeoff.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're off the raft.

- que:
  - come again?
  ans:
  - you're off the raft.

- que:
  - i did what now?
  ans:
  - get your hands off me, boy.

- que:
  - run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn island?
  ans:
  - she might poison the captain himself.

- que:
  - mom?
  ans:
  - it's me, katie.

- que:
  - katherine?
  ans:
  - i'm her daughter.

- que:

  - i need your car keys.

- que:
  - katie?
  ans:
  - oh, god.

- que:
  - you wanna tell us the truth?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you don't want him to go, do you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - ls that why you tried to make him sick?
  ans:
  - michael and jin working together all the time, pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up.

- que:
  - are you gonna tell the others?
  ans:
  - i don't see any reason why they need to know.

- que:
  - are you here to say sorry, sawyer?
  ans:
  - sorry don't suit me.

- que:
  - i cornered you?
  ans:
  - you said if you wanted my spot, you were gonna take it.

- que:
  - why is it so important for you to be on that raft?
  ans:
  - be safe, sawyer.

- que:
  - you getting better?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why should you be punished?
  ans:
  - you were only trying to help me.

- que:
  - you are confused, aren't you?
  ans:
  - frightened.

- que:
  - who is this?
  ans:
  - i am a doctor.

- que:
  - do you understand me?
  ans:
  - no, i don't.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on here?
  ans:
  - there are people coming for you even as we speak.

- que:
  - are you there?
  ans:
  - it's right there in black and white, mr murdoch.

- que:
  - mr murdoch, yes, where is he?
  ans:
  - he just left not 5 minutes ago.

- que:
  - please, won't you come in?
  ans:
  - you must be emma murdoch.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - a rather crude experiment designed to further my studies.

- que:
  - john told you what happened?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - when was the last time that you saw him?
  ans:
  - 3 weeks ago.

  - when you left your wallet.

- que:
  - you expect me to remember?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - where you headed, chief?
  ans:
  - home.

- que:
  - haven't you mugs got anything better to do?
  ans:
  - well, i'm just trying to do my job, may.

- que:
  - maybe you should be out looking for him instead of cooling your heels, huh?
  ans:
  - aw, go on, get out of here.

- que:
  - 6 hookers in all?
  ans:
  - i believe so, sir.

- que:
  - so, husselbeck, what kind of killer do you think stops to save a dying fish?
  ans:
  - you've got me, sir.

- que:
  - bumstead, what took you?
  ans:
  - this killer's been running circles around us, thanks to walenski.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - walenski.

- que:
  - where do you begin?
  ans:
  - everything detective walenski committed to paper should be here.

- que:
  - do these names mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you going to accuse him of something?
  ans:
  - maybe murder.

- que:
  - which one?
  ans:
  - all of them.

- que:
  - i hope you're still breathing.
  ans:
  - have we met before?

- que:
  - what's your name, honey?
  ans:
  - john.

- que:
  - how do you know i'm not the killer?
  ans:
  - you don't seem like the killer type.

- que:
  - you feeling any urges i should know about?
  ans:
  - aw, shoot.

- que:
  - we might ask the same question, yes?
  ans:
  - sleep now.

- que:
  - what is to be done?
  ans:
  - this man is dangerous.

- que:
  - what has the doctor to say about this?
  ans:
  - he has failed to report in.

- que:
  - and mr quick?
  ans:
  - no more mr quick.

- que:
  - should we not know, mr hand?
  ans:
  - we had hoped to learn more before sharing with you.

- que:
  - i found these keys in my pocket, so i assume i live here.
  ans:
  - are you punishing me?

- que:
  - supposed to be?
  ans:
  - john.

- que:
  - you really... don't know who i am, do you?
  ans:
  - your doctor called me.

- que:
  - my doctor?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why was i seeing a doctor?
  ans:
  - i was frightened.

- que:
  - must we reproduce mr murdoch's memories again?
  ans:
  - i tried to imprint him, but he woke up.

- que:
  - he has no memories, then?
  ans:
  - only fragments.

- que:
  - you have had strays before, right?
  ans:
  - this is no stray, doctor.

- que:
  - you will process another template of the subject's memories, yes?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - we'll talk again after tonight's tuning, but no more delays, yes?
  ans:
  - no more inconsistencies in your behaviour.

- que:
  - you do?
  ans:
  - the car outside, the one you arrived in.

- que:
  - stand aside, will you, please?
  ans:
  - we're almost there, buddy.

- que:
  - hey, you happen to know the way to shell beach?
  ans:
  - you're kidding.

- que:
  - how is he?
  ans:
  - the same.

- que:
  - what happened then, eddie?
  ans:
  - nothing happened, frank.

- que:
  - do you think about the past much, frank?
  ans:
  - as much as the next guy.

- que:
  - you saw something, didn't you, eddie?
  ans:
  - something to do with the case.

- que:
  - a catalogue of conquests?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - that's the purpose of your little zoo, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it is time.

- que:
  - why is everyone asleep?
  ans:
  - shh.

- que:
  - what have you done to me?
  ans:
  - nothing, nothing.

- que:
  - i did that?
  ans:
  - listen to me, john.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - an opposing influence on the machines?
  ans:
  - then this man murdoch is more powerful than we thought.

- que:
  - how will his imprint allow us to find him?
  ans:
  - everywhere he goes, everyone he seeks out will be known to us.

- que:
  - ls it done?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, mr book.

- que:
  - brings back memories, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - stop by sometime.

- que:
  - can you tell me the way to avenue c?
  ans:
  - try the subway.

- que:
  - you, uh, been working here long?
  ans:
  - 25 years, no days off for good behaviour.

- que:
  - all change?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - how do i get to the end of the line?
  ans:
  - that's the express.

- que:
  - there's no way out, you know?
  ans:
  - you can't get out of the city.

- que:
  - you're murdoch, aren't you?
  ans:
  - the one they've been looking for.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - used to be a cop.

- que:
  - they steal people's memories, you know?
  ans:
  - then they swap them around between us.

- que:
  - how do you know all this?
  ans:
  - once in a while, one of us wakes up while they're changing things.

- que:
  - i'm sorry?
  ans:
  - to be able to revisit those places which have meant so very much to us.

- que:
  - where is your husband now?
  ans:
  - i wish i knew.

- que:
  - what brings you here?
  ans:
  - i met my wife at this place.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - wait.

- que:
  - ls that me?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - shell beach is where i grew up?
  ans:
  - that's what i said.

- que:
  - how do i get there?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - where are they now?
  ans:
  - they're dead, johnny.

- que:
  - what's the scar?
  ans:
  - you burnt your arm pretty bad in the fire.

- que:
  - i can't remember when she gave it to me.
  ans:
  - what does it mean, johnny?

- que:
  - what's happening, lnspector?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure i know anymore.

- que:
  - you can sleep here tonight, huh?
  ans:
  - glad to have you back, johnny, even if it is for just a night.

- que:
  - ls that the right time?
  ans:
  - why, sure.

- que:
  - what do you think, johnny?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - how'd i miss it?
  ans:
  - you're tired.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - emma, he's here.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - we fashioned this city on stolen memories, different eras, different pasts, all rolled into one.

- que:
  - learn what?
  ans:
  - about you, mr murdoch, you and your fellow inhabitants, what makes you human.

- que:
  - what are you?
  ans:
  - she was alive when i left her.

- que:
  - what about this?
  ans:
  - this is nothing.

- que:
  - what pictures?
  ans:
  - i don't understand this.

- que:
  - you think it makes sense to me?
  ans:
  - i'm as much in the dark here as you are.

- que:
  - you heard of a place called shell beach?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - know how to get there?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - can you tell me?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - wait.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i just mean... during the day.

- que:
  - when was the last time you remember seeing it?
  ans:
  - and i'm not talking about some distant, half forgotten childhood memory.

- que:
  - you know something?
  ans:
  - i don't think the sun even... exists... in this place.

- que:
  - i know this is gonna sound crazy, but what if we never knew each other before now?
  ans:
  - someone just wants us to think it did.

- que:
  - but how can that be true?
  ans:
  - i so vividly remember meeting you.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - detective walenski killed himself last night.

- que:
  - how can we help you, sir?
  ans:
  - you can sleep.

- que:
  - don't you think it's about time you started giving me some answers?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - won't you please sit down?
  ans:
  - l i come here quite often.

- que:
  - what do they want from me?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - you're kidding me, right?
  ans:
  - we're running out of time, john.

- que:
  - let's go, doctor.
  ans:
  - doctor?

- que:
  - where are we going?
  ans:
  - shell beach.

- que:
  - that's where you want to go, isn't it?
  ans:
  - they'll be waiting for us.

- que:
  - who are you people?
  ans:
  - we must go to the end of the canal.

- que:
  - will a man, given the history of a killer, continue in that vein, or are we, in fact, more than the mere sum of our memories?
  ans:
  - this business of you being a killer was an unhappy coincidence.

- que:
  - why are they doing all of this?
  ans:
  - it is our capacity for individuality, our souls that makes us different from them.

- que:
  - they're dying, you see?
  ans:
  - their entire race is on the brink of extinction.

- que:
  - where do i fit in?
  ans:
  - you are different, john.

- que:
  - so why do they need you?
  ans:
  - when they first brought us here, they extracted what was in us.

- que:
  - what about my childhood?
  ans:
  - shell beach, uncle karl.

- que:
  - you say they brought us here.
  ans:
  - what about this?

- que:
  - from where?
  ans:
  - you see, i have become the monster you were intended to be.

- que:
  - john?
  ans:
  - they want to imprint you with their own collective memories.

- que:
  - you control their machines.
  ans:
  - what have you done?

- que:
  - where's emma?
  ans:
  - she is not emma anymore, john.

- que:
  - what are you going to do now, john?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna fix things.

- que:
  - you told me i had the power, didn't you?
  ans:
  - i can make these machines do anything i want.

  - i have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...

- que:
  - do you like that rope i gave you?
  ans:
  - it's easier to jump with, it's got handles.

- que:
  - did you have so little interest in seeing me?
  ans:
  - to tell you the truth, not very much.

- que:
  - unfortunately, it's too late now, isn't it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - today, a good girl.

- que:
  - and this innocent child?
  ans:
  - don't worry.

- que:
  - is she up yet?
  ans:
  - she's been up for some time.

- que:
  - why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
  ans:
  - i have asked her but she's ungrateful.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - sit down.

- que:
  - you like me, don't you?
  ans:
  - i'd be really ungrateful, if i didn't.

- que:
  - how far are you prepared to help me?
  ans:
  - just say the word, sir, and i'll do anything.

- que:
  - why don't you speak to her, ramona?
  ans:
  - women are good at that sort of thing.

- que:
  - why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
  ans:
  - you're right, but we must do something.

- que:
  - this one, sir?
  ans:
  - yes, leave it there.

- que:
  - why didn't you wake me?
  ans:
  - they say it's dangerous.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - it's no more odd than anything else.

- que:
  - you'll do what i ask, then?
  ans:
  - whatever you wish.

- que:
  - wasn't that cowardice?
  ans:
  - no, it isn't that.

- que:
  - you're really serious?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why are you crying?
  ans:

- que:
  - don't you understand that i want to get dressed?
  ans:
  - i forgot everything because of you, even the passion that has kept me going all these years.

- que:
  - explain everything to her seriously.
  ans:
  - what did you say to her, sir?

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - she'll only look at me that way again...

- que:
  - but what can i say to her, sir?
  ans:
  - tell her i lied, that i didn't take advantage of her.

- que:
  - you believe me, don't you?
  ans:
  - you cannot leave...

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - there's been an accident.

- que:

  ans:
  - i would have come immediately.

- que:
  - do you know the reason?
  ans:
  - i want a complete confession from you.

- que:
  - is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows?
  ans:
  - there must be something.

- que:
  - what great plans are you thinking of dedicating yourself to now?
  ans:
  - i know my own weakness, and whatever i do will be humble.

- que:
  - why isn't she coming?
  ans:
  - she has already crossed herself.

- que:
  - are you ready?
  ans:
  - when you are, miss.

- que:
  - are you the other two?
  ans:
  - yes, miss, that's us, yes.

- que:
  - why did he acknowledge me at the last moment?
  ans:
  - he was very good.

- que:
  - why did he kill himself?
  ans:
  - i don't know, sir.

- que:
  - i'm not like him, am i?
  ans:
  - not in that way.

- que:
  - why do you say that?

  ans:
  - what's your name?

- que:
  - what's going on, moncho?
  ans:
  - this louse is looking for trouble.

- que:

  ans:
  - i've had a gutful of this.

- que:
  - are you tired?
  ans:
  - i nearly walked my legs off today.

- que:
  - why don't you let me do that, miss?
  ans:
  - because i've got him into bad habits.

- que:
  - what's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - why the bad temper?
  ans:
  - it's viridiana.

- que:
  - do you know what i think?
  ans:
  - what's annoying you is that she pays so little attention to you.

- que:
  - he has the devil in him.
  ans:
  - so you didn't come from the poorhouse?

- que:
  - when it itches, how does he manage to scratch when he can't see?
  ans:
  - tell him his mother comes to scratch me.

- que:
  - have you eaten well?
  ans:
  - i don't want to criticize the saintly miss who is so good to us, but i would take the liberty of saying that the beans were acid.

  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - sour, idiot.

  - what do you know about me?
  ans:
  - i know that you used to work with an architect.

- que:
  - i'd like to ask you, miss, to pose...
  ans:
  - and do you know that i lived with my mother?

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - just so the virgin can be really pretty.

- que:
  - do you have great devotion for the virgin?
  ans:
  - i'm not a bigot, miss, but everybody has his own beliefs... and then... with this terrible thing... if i didn't have faith...

- que:
  - did you sleep well, miss?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - i'm very sorry for you.
  ans:

- que:
  - and let him get run over by somebody else?
  ans:
  - i'll buy him.

- que:
  - how much do you want for him?
  ans:
  - if you want...

- que:
  - let's go, don't be afraid.

  - what do you think of that?
  ans:
  - i'll go along with it... if it's being respectful enough.

  - he came to thank me for my efforts to bring the americans, our friends, to help us against the atheists, he said the communists.

- que:
  - he came to thank you for helping bring america to help him?
  ans:
  - and now he may be responsible for bombing america.

- que:
  - what do you make of him when you met him?
  ans:
  - i was not impressed, to be honest with you.

- que:
  - is that what he was thinking about?
  ans:
  - because if the public knew this it wouldn't look very good.

- que:
  - why didn't bush want the press and public to see bath's name on his military records?
  ans:
  - bush and bath had become good friends when they both served in the texas national guard.

- que:
  - but the question has always been where did this money come from?
  ans:
  - now his dad was rich.

- que:
  - whenever they got into trouble there were these angel investors who flowed money into the companies.
  ans:
  - so where did george w. bush get his money?

- que:
  - bush visits saudi arabia on behalf of carlyle and meets with the royal family and meets with the bin laden family.
  ans:
  - so the question is why would saudis with all the oil in the world go around the globe to invest in this lousy oil company?

- que:
  - who's your daddy?
  ans:
  - because that's how much the saudi royals and their associates have given the bush family.

- que:
  - or me?
  ans:
  - now, after 9/ 11, it was an embarrassment and they preferred that no one ask any questions.

- que:
  - this commission?
  ans:
  - testify, i mean, i'd be glad to visit with them.

- que:
  - wow.
  ans:
  - the lawyers the saudi defense minister hired to fight the 9/ 11 families?

- que:
  - how much money do the saudis have invested in america, roughly?
  ans:
  - uh, i've heard figures inside of $860 billion dollars.

- que:
  - and uh, what percentage of our economy is that?
  ans:
  - that seems like a lot.

- que:
  - what would happen if like one day they just pulled that trillion dollars out?
  ans:
  - a trillion dollars, that would be an enormous blow to the economy.

- que:
  - could i speak with you for a moment please, sir?

- que:
  - george bush invited bandar bush to the white house for a private dinner and talk.
  ans:
  - no no, do they give you any trouble?

- que:
  - why would bandar's government block american investigators from talking to the relatives of the fifteen hijackers?
  ans:
  - the two of them rocked out on the truman balcony so that bandar could smoke a cigar and have a drink.

- que:
  - the president, in a very intimidating way,
  ans:
  - on that day, what did the president say to you?

- que:
  - did he ask about any other nations other than iraq?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and were his questions more about iraq than about al qaeda?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - who in their right mind would do that?
  ans:
  - nice shot.

- que:
  - or was the war in afghanistan really about something else?
  ans:
  - perhaps the answer was in houston, texas.

- que:
  - and who got a caspian sea drilling contract the same day unocal signed the pipeline deal?
  ans:
  - halliburton.

- que:
  - here is the taliban official visiting our state department to meet with us officials.
  ans:
  - and who else stood to benefit from the pipeline?

- que:
  - who was hamid karzai?
  ans:

  - and how do you make them afraid?
  ans:

- que:

  ans:
  - not signed by a member of the senate.

- que:
  - is the objection signed by a senator?
  ans:
  - unfortunately, mr. president, it is not signed by one single senator.

- que:
  - is the objection in writing...... and signed by a member of the house and a senator?
  ans:
  - the objection is in writing, and i don't care...... that it is not signed by a member of the senate.

- que:
  - what about these folks that say that you're taking too long of a vacation?
  ans:

  - yeah.

- que:
  - what are you doing the rest of the day?
  ans:
  - karen hughes is coming over.

- que:
  - behave yourself, will you?
  ans:
  - make me look young.

- que:
  - osama has had contact with other family members?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - bin ladens?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - here?
  ans:
  - in america.

- que:
  - that's the proper procedure?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did the authorities do anything when the bin ladens tried to leave?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what else?
  ans:
  - if you hear anything, let us know.

- que:
  - how long?
  ans:
  - you've got time.

- que:
  - who authorized it?
  ans:
  - lmagine what those poor bastards were feeling...

- que:
  - what was the circumstance under which you met?
  ans:
  - this is ironic.

- que:
  - isn't it ironic?
  ans:
  - he came to thank you for helping bring america to help him.

- que:
  - what did you make of him?
  ans:
  - i was not impressed.

- que:
  - not impressed?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - the question is, why would saudis, who had all the oil in the world...... go around the globe to invest in this lousy oil company?
  ans:
  - access is power.

- que:
  - or is he representing both?
  ans:
  - this company is about money, not conspiracies to run the world...... or engineer political maneuvering and things like that.

- que:
  - this commission?
  ans:
  - you know, i don't...

- que:
  - testify?
  ans:
  - i'd be glad to visit with them.

- que:
  - how much money do the saudis have invested in america, roughly?
  ans:
  - i've heard figures as high as $860 billion.

- que:
  - eight hundred and sixty billion?
  ans:
  - billion.

- que:
  - and what percentage of our economy does that represent?
  ans:
  - it seems like a lot.

- que:
  - a trillion dollars?
  ans:
  - that would be an enormous blow to the economy.

- que:
  - good, how you doing?

  ans:
  - no, not at all.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - there's nothing specific to report.

- que:
  - could these cattle be a target for terrorists?
  ans:
  - fear works.

- que:
  - and how do you make them afraid?
  ans:
  - well, you make them afraid by creating an aura of endless threat.

- que:
  - how high do you have to be in the building...... for that chute to actually take effect?
  ans:
  - you only have to be on the 10th floor or above.

- que:
  - they can put this on themselves?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - is this something that you honestly think, in a moment of panic...... that someone can operate properly?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

  - what did the fbi tell you?
  ans:
  - well, they contacted me by phone.

- que:
  - is there any target around here?

  ans:
  - never know what's gonna happen.

  ans:
  - i've told him at least on two occasions.

- que:
  - is that correct?
  ans:
  - that is correct.

- que:
  - and they weren't there to jazzercise.
  ans:
  - i feel my rights have been, you know, trampled on.

- que:
  - how could congress pass this patriot act without even reading it?
  ans:
  - sit down, my son.

- que:
  - do you really know what that would entail...... if we were to read every bill that we passed?
  ans:
  - well, the good thing, it would slow down the legislative process.

- que:
  - what would you like?

  ans:
  - actually, yes, you're fine.

  ans:
  - and be faithful in what happens.

- que:
  - do you trust this president?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - and why shouldn't they?
  ans:
  - he'd spent the better part of the last year...... giving them every reason why we should invade iraq.

- que:
  - who's in that coalition of the willing?
  ans:
  - you will find out who's in it.

- que:
  - afghanistan?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - am i slanted and biased?
  ans:
  - you damn well bet i am.

  - with the war not going as planned...... and the military in need of many more troops...... where would they find the new recruits?
  ans:

  ans:
  - come right here.

- que:

  ans:
  - it was because the underdog is who needed me.

  - he spent every rupee of the king's fortune feeding the poor.

- que:
  - can you hold this, please?
  ans:
  - well, look, the king let thomas go and thomas spent the rest of his happy life sacrificing for others.

- que:
  - so thomas conned the king, right?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you still struggling?
  ans:
  - every day.

- que:
  - that's a big one, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i can't believe i'm doing this.

- que:
  - i mean, him?
  ans:
  - a trumpet.

- que:
  - you didn't hear?
  ans:
  - no, he confessed.

- que:
  - confessed to what?
  ans:
  - he didn't do anything.

- que:
  - now, tom, what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think...

- que:
  - mr turner?
  ans:
  - yeah, they arrested the wrong man.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - he wasn't involved in any of this.

- que:
  - and how do you know this?
  ans:
  - because i did it all.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - i did it all.

- que:
  - mr bacon?
  ans:
  - this court is now in session.

- que:
  - when did you get out of the rubber bungalow?
  ans:
  - good to see you.

- que:
  - he knows you?
  ans:
  - i used to live with him, in another life.

- que:
  - does the defence have an opening statement?
  ans:
  - not at this time.

- que:
  - so you turned to tom turner?
  ans:
  - well, no.

- que:
  - can i have my son back now?
  ans:
  - i've dealt with some of these attorneys.

- que:
  - witnesses?
  ans:
  - i don't even know where my lawyer is.

- que:
  - why would a con like tom turner do good deeds?
  ans:
  - think about it.

- que:
  - did you talk them into this?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - mr dooly, do you really expect us to believe you're the enforcer type?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - wanna see me enforce something?
  ans:
  - i'd like to enforce you.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - and you're going to heaven?
  ans:
  - i believe in russian proverb.

- que:
  - may i finish, please?
  ans:
  - knock yourself out.

- que:
  - is this going somewhere?
  ans:
  - perhaps he does not live within lawyers.

- que:
  - maybe the media?
  ans:
  - maybe, i don't know, lex luthor.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - now that i have your attention, mr banks, please proceed with a little more decorum, rather than this childish display of histrionics.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - put your arm around me.

- que:
  - rebecca?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - the government wishes to keep its focus on mr tom turner, despite the multitude of sins confessed to by his co workers.
  ans:
  - will you stop the shaking?

- que:
  - now, what do these co workers have in common?
  ans:
  - all of them have worked at the post office for years without ever committing a crime.

- que:
  - and what of the countless others who write to god every day?
  ans:
  - there must be accountability here.

- que:
  - dogs?
  ans:
  - your honour, these are my witnesses for my closing argument.

- que:
  - and rocky is a healthy little doggie, aren't you, sugars?
  ans:
  - and that is his friend, taffy.

- que:
  - can the dogs leave now, before there's an accident?
  ans:
  - ok, everybody up.

- que:
  - would you like to know why?
  ans:
  - i'd like to know.

- que:
  - speaking on his own behalf, may tom turner finish my closing argument?
  ans:
  - roll the trucks.

- que:
  - she's making tom speak?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i mean, how could people, especially people dealt such crummy, pathetic hands, have faith in anything or anyone?
  ans:
  - i don't know how things got going, but it's not because i had some sort of noble intention.

- que:
  - your honour, i lost my programme notes.
  ans:
  - mr bacon, will you please see to it that all of the windows are tightly closed?

- que:
  - is this where we all clap for tinker bell?
  ans:
  - you're blessed with a con artist's gift of talking his way out of trouble.

- que:
  - so how do i know if your words are sincere or if they're some cynical attempt to talk your way out of trouble?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - would somebody please tell me what is going on out there?
  ans:
  - the federal courthouse is surrounded by what appears to be every mail truck in the southland.

- que:
  - steep odds.
  ans:
  - are you nuts?

- que:
  - you bet the bailiff on the verdict?
  ans:
  - just a silly side bet.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - he's got a girl with him.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - so the trial of tom turner ended but the effects of the god squad linger through the holiday season and, hopefully, even longer.

- que:
  - herman, how are you doing?
  ans:
  - welcome back.

- que:
  - why wouldn't you have?
  ans:
  - and and the groundlings, very much aroused...

- que:
  - hey, hey, motherfucker, are you deaf?
  ans:
  - i didn't pay $1, 500 for both these seats... and flatten them watchamajiggem up here to see no king lear.

- que:
  - what the fuck is wrong?
  ans:
  - my brother, i'm a man of peace.

- que:
  - why do you box?
  ans:
  - here we go.

- que:
  - am i right?
  ans:
  - a mighty god.

- que:
  - was that as easy a fight as it looked?
  ans:
  - of course it was easy.

- que:
  - are you mad at something?
  ans:
  - i'm a little upset with myself, because i had a image of this guy falling on a right hand.

- que:
  - with a left or a right?
  ans:
  - oh, definitely.

- que:
  - did this guy hurt you at all?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - bored?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - who do you plan to fight next?
  ans:
  - uh, well, that's the reverend's job.

- que:
  - boy, that boy's good, ain't he?
  ans:
  - we're just asking the reverend to give us a shot at the title.

- que:
  - where the fuck you from?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you what, honk.

- que:
  - is this what you want?
  ans:
  - that's exactly what i want.

- que:
  - how was the house, peter?
  ans:
  - capacity.

- que:
  - bad news.
  ans:
  - do you have the pay per view pickup, artemus?

- que:
  - how bad?
  ans:
  - you're my brother.

- que:
  - sol?
  ans:

  ans:
  - wait.

- que:
  - let me fix your hat.
  ans:
  - what up, kid?

- que:
  - can you forgive me as i forgive you?
  ans:
  - i hurt.

- que:
  - and we'll settle with the champ for what?
  ans:
  - fifteen cents on the dollar..

- que:
  - champ, you would let this man... the only father figure you've ever had, destroy himself for you?
  ans:
  - you bet your yarmulke.

- que:
  - peter, do you know what's wrong?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - artemus?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - sol?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how about you, champ?
  ans:
  - there's a reason everyone has lost interest... in the heavyweight championship of the world.

- que:
  - a white heavyweight?
  ans:
  - man, the two words don't even go together..

- que:
  - what's the highest grossing fight in the history of boxing?
  ans:
  - uh, tyson gibbons.

- que:
  - can you tell me why, james?
  ans:
  - all right, all right.

- que:
  - that a what?
  ans:
  - uh, a a brougham.

- que:
  - what's a brougham?
  ans:
  - it's maroon.

- que:
  - did we cut?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you guys don't know what a merlot brougham is?
  ans:
  - i thought it was a breakfast cereal.

- que:
  - that what he said.
  ans:
  - your daddy said... what?

- que:
  - you're a little camera shy, aren't you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - this the guy at the top of your list, julio?
  ans:
  - look at this shit.

- que:
  - where'd he go?
  ans:
  - good for you.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - watch.

- que:
  - i have an idea.
  ans:
  - see?

- que:
  - oh, you gonna clown me?
  ans:
  - you can run this shit yourself.

- que:
  - i was simply trying to say the champ, he's never lost as a proffessional, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - yeah, so what?
  ans:
  - he was b. f. d.

- que:
  - who cares?
  ans:
  - he was an amateur..

- que:
  - are you on something?
  ans:
  - hey, hey, hey, shut the fuck up.

- que:
  - ten years ago, who beat roper as an amateur?
  ans:
  - his mother.

- que:
  - uh, who?
  ans:
  - terry conklin.

- que:
  - terry who?
  ans:
  - you work for me now.

- que:
  - now, where were we?
  ans:
  - marvin, marvin, chill.

- que:
  - and the next thing you know... we got guns on you, and what you got, huh?
  ans:
  - we don't have any of those.

- que:
  - but i mean, you know, does violence really solve anything?
  ans:
  - i mean, we just came over because you haven't answered our calls or anything like that.

- que:
  - so you are giving us a shot at the title?
  ans:
  - you have my word.

- que:
  - excuse me, reverend, but your word don't mean shit, all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, i mean, your word is rather doo... doo.

- que:
  - are you still driving that, um, maroon brougham?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - artemus?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - man, this is this rayon?
  ans:
  - this is nice.

- que:

  ans:
  - i think he's gorgeous.

- que:
  - say what?
  ans:
  - for a white boy.

- que:
  - may i call you terry?
  ans:
  - what you call me is of no concern to me.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - i want you to return to the ring.

- que:
  - yeah, right, right.
  ans:
  - i did cold cock that sucker, didn't i?

  ans:
  - ten million dollars.

- que:
  - well.
  ans:
  - ten million dollars?

- que:
  - you found terry conklin, huh?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - now, what's it gonna take for you to make this happen?
  ans:
  - i can't do it.

- que:
  - money?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - power?
  ans:
  - yeah, power.

- que:
  - and who do you think's gonna see the debacle?
  ans:
  - this'll is the biggest payday in sports history, much less boxing.

- que:
  - or buster douglas against tyson?
  ans:
  - julo escobar's a whore on your payroll.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - keep it legal.

- que:
  - did you hear that?
  ans:
  - that's a libelous statement and a racist comment...

- que:
  - do you hate jews and negroes as well?
  ans:
  - i am a jew.

- que:
  - ring magazine says the fight is a fraud?
  ans:
  - the truth needs to be shaped and molded and framed, sol.

- que:
  - tough day for you, huh?
  ans:
  - we need to get these contracts to conklin for his signature before he gets a good lawyer.

- que:
  - how are the contracts?
  ans:
  - nobody understands anything.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - where'd it come from?
  ans:
  - mitchell kane.

- que:
  - what's he want?
  ans:
  - he says he wants a private meeting.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - pictures of nothing, sol.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i don't need this shit.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - that was pretty funny, huh?
  ans:
  - never more lucid.

- que:
  - or is it a pride in your tribe?
  ans:
  - uh, i'm taking the road less traveled by.

- que:
  - what is the truth, after all?
  ans:
  - history, they say, is written by the winners.

- que:
  - what'd she say?
  ans:
  - give me a hand here, boys.

- que:
  - what the hell?
  ans:
  - let me see the ring.

- que:
  - hey, rollo.
  ans:
  - i was mad quick, right?

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - let me see the diamond.

- que:
  - that look all right?
  ans:
  - it look nice on you.

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:
  - don't worry, man.

- que:
  - what's up with that?
  ans:
  - he ain't here because he's ducking me.

- que:
  - ain't that right, rev?
  ans:
  - you know he gonna get knocked naked from the waist down anyway.

- que:
  - tell him about the deal, will you?
  ans:
  - hey, mr. french, i will bust a cap in your ass.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - you stunted little dwarf.

- que:
  - what you wanna do?
  ans:
  - i'm not gonna scare off.

- que:
  - tranquilize yourself, will you?
  ans:
  - look at you.

- que:
  - you don't want no part of this, do you, white boy?
  ans:
  - what you got here, rev, is shit.

- que:
  - may i?
  ans:
  - we have here 100, 000... cards and letters, all for terry conklin.

- que:
  - let's pick one at random, shall we?
  ans:
  - let's get one of these.

- que:
  - the sultan... is ripe for a fall.
  ans:
  - what's the matter?

- que:
  - do you understand?
  ans:
  - las vegas is one of the most exploitive places i've ever seen in my life... particularly exploitive towards women.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - that was me on the cover of playboy magazine, but let me say two things.

- que:
  - did you see him out there?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - the champ has an entourage.
  ans:
  - so what about all these reports of all this roomservice?

- que:
  - so he's not eating any of this stuff?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - is racism driving this fight?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - are we exploiting a history of divisive racial struggle in this country?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - would that be all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you just wanna blow this fight, don't ya?
  ans:
  - look, titus, chill.

- que:
  - wins?
  ans:
  - oh, man, yeah.

- que:
  - happy?
  ans:
  - i'd sooner be turked by a syphillitic bear.

- que:
  - hmm.
  ans:
  - so, what, after after this fight, you'd consider signing him with another promoter?

- que:
  - what's up, johnny?
  ans:
  - yeah, maybe so.

- que:
  - what about mr. sultan?
  ans:
  - uh, mr. sultan, you know, not so good for you guys.

- que:
  - are you a racist person?
  ans:
  - no, i'm not.

- que:
  - johnny?
  ans:
  - too much of it.

- que:
  - can i have a hug?
  ans:
  - we love you, roper.

- que:
  - is it hope, or is it hype?
  ans:
  - we'll find out the answer tomorrow night.

- que:
  - is that a unitard?
  ans:
  - mitchell.

- que:
  - hey, baby, you feeling all right?
  ans:
  - oh, baby, listen.

- que:
  - we all know you're a racist bastard.
  ans:
  - you know what else?

- que:
  - me, a racist?
  ans:
  - you're a pig.

- que:
  - what have we got here, then, paddy, eh?
  ans:
  - white gloves.

- que:
  - you think this is all just a big joke, right?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - the guy thinks this is a rock concert.

- que:
  - yeah! it's obvious that the champion is delaying his entrance into the arena.
  ans:
  - yet, can a hundred million fans across america be wrong?

- que:
  - recognize, baby, will you?
  ans:
  - we up in here, and he needs to be in the ring.

- que:
  - he could get tired.
  ans:
  - you gonna talk to me like you know me now?

- que:
  - stu, do you think there could be anything wrong?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you what it is, johnny.

- que:
  - but, just in case, don't get him mad, eh?
  ans:
  - he's scared of me.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - the new heavyweight champ of the world, terry conklin, has signed with me.

- que:
  - is there any questions?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - well, i was just wondering up there to mr. roper... what do you think it's gonna feel like to lose to an amateur, chump?
  ans:
  - no, just a whole lot of man.

- que:
  - that's a good idea.
  ans:
  - that's it?

- que:
  - where's my midget?
  ans:
  - he's on queer street.

- que:
  - you ali baba jackson up in this motherfucker?
  ans:
  - oh, not this nigga.

- que:
  - what you wanna do?
  ans:
  - isaac hayes said he wants his head back.

  ans:
  - champ, it's just good publicity for the next fight.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i'm 132 million strong.

- que:
  - why're you acting like you wanna do something?
  ans:
  - you know and i know you don't.

  - matter of fact, my nerves is had anyway.

- que:
  - who the champ now?
  ans:
  - you're the champ. and i just want some respect.

- que:
  - will you?
  ans:
  - we're seeing a championship fight after a championship fight.

- que:
  - well, why didn't you come and see me when i was inside?
  ans:
  - charlie, you know that's not my scene.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - erm...

- que:
  - typical, isn't it?
  ans:
  - out of jail five minutes and already i'm in a hot car.

- que:
  - is that so?
  ans:
  - well, i'm glad you're out.

- que:
  - eh?
  ans:
  - i'll take this lot now.

- que:
  - and will you shorten the sleeves, love?
  ans:
  - i'm not a gorilla.

- que:

  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:

  ans:
  - they originated with bradshaw of the colonial office.

- que:
  - you examined the signatures?
  ans:
  - well, naturally, and i countersigned.

- que:
  - well, those signatures must've been forged?
  ans:
  - we can't exclude the possibility.

- que:
  - your signature was genuine, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - someone had to take responsibility, sir.

- que:
  - what do you propose to do with it?
  ans:
  - that boat....

- que:
  - have you heard me, major?
  ans:
  - message received.

  - where would they find 200 pounds of dynamite?
  ans:
  - get me gen. sutherland.

- que:
  - do you think they mean it?
  ans:
  - nearly two years ago, a haganah ship which we were detaining in the port of haifa...... did blow herself up.

  - will they let me?
  ans:
  - i'll try and arrange it.

- que:
  - do you agree?

- que:
  - you wanted to see me?
  ans:
  - north africa, syria, lebanon and palestine.

- que:
  - is that what sutherland sent you to find out?
  ans:
  - you lied to me about the girl.

- que:
  - tel aviv yet?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what else?
  ans:
  - i'm taking her off this death trap.

- que:
  - how do you know the girl wants to get off?
  ans:
  - i am trying to save a jewish child.

- que:
  - don't you have any respect for human life?
  ans:
  - don't expect me to get hysterical over one jewish child...... and don't you get hysterical, either.

- que:
  - ben canaan?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - not even now?
  ans:
  - kitty...... i couldn't.

- que:
  - go back?
  ans:
  - nonsense.

- que:
  - did we escape for just ourselves alone?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - them or us?
  ans:
  - quiet, please.

- que:
  - is that anything new?
  ans:
  - i stay right here.

- que:
  - why can't you let them go?
  ans:
  - you must understand that we british have shown, throughout our history...... an extraordinary talent for troublesome commitments.

- que:
  - how can you promise something and then not deliver it?
  ans:
  - england was fighting for her life in 1917.

- que:
  - how is it ever going to end?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - the devil.

- que:
  - can i drop you at your hotel?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - mr. smolikov, will you please do me a favor?
  ans:
  - refresh yourself with my bath, and then, little bit later, i'll take yours.

- que:
  - can't you see the position?
  ans:
  - no exceptions.

- que:
  - have you time for me, ari?
  ans:
  - always, dr. odenheim.

- que:
  - what can i do?
  ans:
  - we made a mistake...... a bad mistake in letting the children be a part of this.

- que:
  - what should we do about it?
  ans:
  - when a mistake is made, you admit it...... you analyze it, and you correct it.

- que:
  - who the devil are you?
  ans:
  - jorgenson, of the up.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - lnformation, sir.

- que:
  - lnformation for whom?
  ans:
  - for the tourists, of course.

- que:
  - and i suppose these are tourists?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - what were you two talking about?
  ans:
  - these are nice fat ones, for this the archbishop will bless you.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - ought to make news somewhere.

- que:
  - out to the ship once more?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you really think so?
  ans:
  - undoubtedly.

- que:
  - do you have the power to call off this strike?
  ans:
  - i have.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - then call it off.

- que:
  - you'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - without any regard for the lives you'd be destroying?
  ans:
  - with every regard in the world for them.

- que:
  - but for what purpose?
  ans:
  - call it publicity.

- que:
  - publicity?
  ans:
  - yes, publicity.

- que:
  - does the vulgarity of it shock you?
  ans:
  - you can't fight the whole british empire with 600 people.

- que:
  - when were you there?
  ans:
  - a year ago.

- que:
  - 500, 000 jews against 50 million arabs?
  ans:
  - you can't win.

- que:
  - we have been asked to talk to you, mr. ben canaan.
  ans:
  - why don't you appeal to gen. sutherland?

- que:
  - do you have time?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - when are you going to stop this thing and let them go?
  ans:
  - unfortunately, i can't answer that.

- que:
  - why don't you make a public statement about it?
  ans:
  - i can't do that, kitty.

- que:
  - now i find myself asking how can any man let it happen?
  ans:
  - jew, gentile, buddhist, mohammedan...... no matter what he is.

- que:
  - is that all?
  ans:
  - i heard of dr. odenheim's death.

- que:
  - without food?
  ans:
  - i think i can go without food as long as you.

- que:
  - do you think the british will give in?
  ans:
  - we'll give in first.

- que:
  - if you hate these people so much, why do you want to go to palestine with them?
  ans:
  - because there, jews fight instead of talk.

- que:
  - that proves something?
  ans:
  - there are lots of exceptions.

- que:
  - and do you know something?
  ans:
  - by afternoon, everybody was wearing stars of david.

- que:
  - why'd they do that?
  ans:
  - if you don't just know why they did it, dov...... well, maybe that's what's wrong with you.

- que:
  - do you hear me?
  ans:
  - this is the exodus.

- que:
  - we pause for politics?
  ans:
  - gen. sutherland, at his own request, has been relieved of his duties on cyprus.

- que:
  - have you seen mr. ben canaan?
  ans:
  - i want to thank him for letting me on the ship.

- que:
  - have you seen dov?
  ans:
  - no, not since he left the ship.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - shalom.

- que:
  - again?
  ans:
  - a boy about 17 just went into asa's house.

- que:
  - what's your name?
  ans:
  - karen.

- que:
  - what's yours?
  ans:
  - edna.

- que:
  - and then, after the ghetto was destroyed?
  ans:
  - i hid in the sewers for five months.

- que:
  - eating what?
  ans:
  - when i couldn't sneak out at night and steal garbage, i killed rats.

- que:
  - and they sent you to auschwitz?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - to what work were you assigned in auschwitz?
  ans:
  - i told you that twice already.

- que:
  - cleaning up what?
  ans:
  - the camp area.

- que:
  - and when auschwitz was liberated, you walked to germany?
  ans:
  - you asked me that already, too.

- que:
  - so you want to blow up british installations for the lrgun?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you're an expert dynamiter, true?
  ans:
  - just try me.

- que:
  - will you assist us in making them clear?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - why shouldn't i tell the truth?
  ans:
  - this is always hard to answer.

- que:
  - describe what?
  ans:
  - whatever you like.

- que:
  - who went through the third gate?
  ans:
  - girls.

- que:
  - all the girls?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what happened to them?
  ans:
  - the ss guards kept some of them.

- que:
  - now, those who went through the left gate to be killed...... how was the killing accomplished in auschwitz?
  ans:
  - they went in to take showers, 2, 000 or 3, 000 at a time.

- que:
  - you blew up quite a few nazis with this dynamite?
  ans:
  - all i could.

- que:
  - from the gas chambers, the bodies went where?
  ans:
  - the ovens.

- que:
  - before the installation of the ovens, what happened to the bodies?
  ans:
  - they buried them.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - in trenches and holes.

- que:
  - and who dug the holes?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i ask you again, who dug the graves?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - now may i tell you something, dov landau?
  ans:
  - at no time did the jews use dynamite in the warsaw ghetto.

- que:
  - do you remember better now?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - true?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - correct?
  ans:
  - we take into consideration that you were less than 13 when you entered auschwitz.

- que:
  - is there anything else?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you wanted me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - i've got to see akiva.

- que:
  - we tell haganah where our leaders are hiding?
  ans:
  - forget haganah.

- que:
  - his son's different?
  ans:
  - just tell akiva and let him decide.

- que:
  - if i can find him, where can i telephone you this evening?
  ans:
  - i'll be here on the terrace from 7:0 on.

- que:
  - do you like the view here?
  ans:
  - mr. ben canaan.

- que:
  - are we both eating alone?
  ans:
  - i am.

- que:
  - won't you sit down?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - would you like a drink?
  ans:
  - i had one at the consulate.

- que:
  - what were you doing at the consulate today?
  ans:
  - i've asked them to help me find karen's father.

- que:
  - what happens if you find out her father's dead?
  ans:
  - then i'll take her back to america with me.

- que:
  - won't your husband have something to say about that?
  ans:
  - my husband was killed a year ago...... in a border skirmish near the sheikh hussein bridge.

- que:
  - you mean, here in palestine?
  ans:
  - he was a news photographer covering the near east.

- que:
  - don't you feel uncomfortable here?
  ans:
  - i guess i'm as safe here as any place else.

  - where do you come from?
  ans:
  - i don't come from anywhere.

- que:
  - do you like farms?
  ans:
  - i was raised on one.

- que:
  - do i know you well enough to ask you for a lift?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:

  ans:
  - nothing serious.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - many reasons.

- que:
  - and you want a whole one?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - what else?
  ans:
  - excuse me, sir.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - i have to go back to the terrace.

- que:
  - two hundred pounds of dynamite?
  ans:
  - immediately, the british draw proper conclusions.

- que:
  - may i speculate?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - correct?
  ans:
  - it's close.

- que:
  - also correct?
  ans:
  - also.

- que:
  - an alliance to fight?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - but what about you, ari?
  ans:
  - forget haganah for one moment, and tell me what you think.

- que:
  - may i tell you something?
  ans:
  - firstly...... justice itself is an abstraction...... completely devoid of reality.

- que:
  - i suppose that means more bombings and more killings?
  ans:
  - i'll put it this way.

- que:
  - now tell me, how is your mother?
  ans:
  - she's fine.

- que:
  - and little jordana?
  ans:
  - little jordana just won her second marksmanship medal with the palmach.

  - and barak...... still counts my name among the dead on yom kippur?
  ans:
  - ten years.

- que:

  ans:
  - you can't talk to him about it.

- que:
  - it's not much of a home, is it?
  ans:
  - with only rose's samovar to make a memory real.

- que:
  - you want to look with me?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - do you know your bible?
  ans:
  - ln a presbyterian sort of way.

- que:
  - isn't your father's name barak?
  ans:
  - in russia, he was yakov rabinski.

- que:
  - don't you understand that you make me feel like a presbyterian...... when you can't, for just a minute or two, forget that you're a jew?
  ans:
  - i'm here, barak.

- que:
  - have you hurt yourself?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - ari?
  ans:
  - take this for me.

- que:
  - now, young ladies and gentlemen...... can you give me a little style?
  ans:
  - it's not fair keeping david in cyprus so long.

- que:
  - a nice piece of strudel, mrs. fremont?
  ans:
  - i couldn't.

- que:
  - that is if you are ready, mrs. fremont?
  ans:
  - you should see it before dark.

- que:
  - irgun, haganah, what difference does it make?
  ans:
  - i spent 14 months in that prison.

- que:
  - how many lrgun does your plan call for?
  ans:
  - twenty six, divided into four attack groups...

- que:
  - what do you want with dov landau?
  ans:
  - akiva's execution is six days away.

- que:

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - you've won your freedom.

- que:
  - if it makes no difference, why have you fought so hard?
  ans:
  - because we had hundreds of thousands of people with no other place to go.

- que:
  - why should they go anywhere?
  ans:
  - this is their home as well as ours.

- que:
  - don't you see?
  ans:

  - we of all people...... should no longer be surprised when death reaches out to us.

- que:
  - what are they trying to tell you?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but we are getting her out.

- que:
  - what the hell do you think you are doing?
  ans:
  - there is a life form in here.

- que:
  - could you hurry please, miss?
  ans:
  - done, captain.

- que:
  - can i have this please?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - can you give me one good reason why i shouldn't arrest you?
  ans:
  - i am dr. aki ross.

- que:
  - do you realize you have just risk the lives at my squad and me?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - you and your men?
  ans:
  - she thinks you are a man.

- que:
  - have we been given a choice?
  ans:
  - nobody asked you to save me.

- que:
  - gray?
  ans:
  - yeah, nice to see you too.

- que:
  - let's make sure of this, shall we?
  ans:
  - i hate getting scanned.

- que:
  - why are you always busting my chop?
  ans:
  - people, let's just do this thing.

- que:
  - or that woman?
  ans:
  - both.

- que:
  - what level is he?
  ans:
  - blue.

- que:
  - how much more time?
  ans:
  - not enough.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - we lost contact.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - forward me the phantom data and everything we got in the file spirits collected so far.

- que:
  - spirits?
  ans:
  - aki, you know there are elements in the council military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.

- que:
  - 1 0 years ago, who discovered the energy and the phantoms?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - and who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - read.

- que:
  - do we not?
  ans:
  - yes, indeed we do.

- que:
  - and what exactly does that mean, doctor?
  ans:
  - it means there is a very good chance to being from the zeus cannon built in the phantoms in a media.

- que:
  - you mean the spirit of the earth?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - has a spirit?
  ans:
  - that's a fairy tale, doctor.

- que:
  - don't you agree?
  ans:
  - yes, i mean of disabling the phantoms.

- que:
  - where is the proof?
  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - but i wonder what caused?
  ans:
  - doctor, i can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me.

- que:
  - mind if i take a look?
  ans:
  - you'll probably get bored.

- que:
  - so what are you doing?
  ans:
  - oh, i see.

- que:
  - what do you think you are doing?
  ans:
  - we just gonna strengthen them for a while.

- que:
  - it's your idea?
  ans:
  - we just help the captain up a little.

- que:
  - where's your sense of romance?
  ans:
  - you see how the captain looks at her.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - probably just a glint.

- que:
  - leaving your helmet on and not telling me who you were?
  ans:
  - that doesn't seem a little childish.

- que:
  - now you know what's going on, alright?
  ans:
  - now i know.

- que:
  - and you won't even see me?
  ans:
  - i was probably helping dr. sid collected the spirit wave.

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - about the spirits you collected.

- que:
  - the second was a fish.
  ans:
  - how could you?

- que:
  - a fish?
  ans:
  - the third was a deer i found in a wildlife preserved outside moscow.

- que:
  - ever try to track a sparrow out of space?
  ans:
  - it's no fun.

- que:
  - what am i saying?
  ans:
  - you probably would love that.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you skipped one.

- que:
  - you don't believe any of this, do you?
  ans:
  - i just... don't know, aki.

- que:
  - is this why you shut me out?
  ans:
  - you should have told me.

- que:
  - who does?
  ans:
  - i better get back to scanning.

- que:
  - what were you impressions of dr ross?
  ans:
  - she seems very capable and determines.

- que:
  - ebullient behavior, sir?
  ans:
  - the general is wondering why he explains himself to a captain.

- que:
  - no heroin today, okay?
  ans:
  - everything by the book.

- que:
  - have you done any wasteland recon before?
  ans:
  - and get pretty ugly.

- que:
  - what is it doing out here?
  ans:
  - hoping for life to return.

- que:
  - is that our spirit, doc?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - distance?
  ans:
  - hard to say.

- que:
  - the barrier cities?
  ans:
  - i mean it's just by with theory energy.

- que:
  - captain, do you read me?
  ans:
  - once again.

- que:
  - are you alright?
  ans:
  - locate that seat.

- que:
  - what the hell is happening here?
  ans:
  - dr ross is to be taken into the custody now.

- que:
  - how is she, doctor?
  ans:
  - she is dying.

- que:
  - aki, where are we?
  ans:
  - on an alien planet.

- que:
  - how is that possible?
  ans:
  - i'm not entirely sure.

- que:
  - dream?
  ans:
  - well, whatever it is.

- que:
  - what's happening to me?
  ans:
  - dr sid is implanting the 7th spirit directly into your body.

- que:
  - and i am watching... what, major?
  ans:
  - it seems dr ross has been recording her dreams.

- que:
  - and why would i be interested in it... her dreams?
  ans:
  - this is it.

- que:
  - why are they staring at us?
  ans:
  - not at us.

- que:
  - how is she, doctor?
  ans:
  - she is going to be fine.

- que:
  - aki, can you hear me?
  ans:
  - i'd finished it.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - my wife and daughter.

- que:
  - did i ever tell you that?
  ans:
  - i try to imagine what...

- que:
  - you've lost family, haven't you?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - how can you be?
  ans:
  - captain, please.

- que:
  - precisely, i think the giant ones are like our whales along for the ride?
  ans:
  - it must be the ship of some kind crazy known as ark.

- que:
  - but how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
  ans:
  - they didn't.

- que:
  - what do you think about all this, captain?
  ans:
  - i think that explains why we never had a chance.

- que:
  - how they die?
  ans:
  - since then, all they know is suffering.

- que:
  - how many phantoms?
  ans:
  - more than enough to convince the council, sir.

- que:
  - major, what the hell is going on here?
  ans:
  - it must be carry resistible charge passing through the barrier.

- que:
  - okay, now what?
  ans:
  - we're going through the station.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - captain, with all respect...

- que:
  - doc?
  ans:
  - interesting.

- que:
  - we'll be back for you, sergeant.
  ans:
  - anybody hurt?

- que:
  - you hear me?
  ans:
  - i hear you, captain.

- que:
  - neil, do you read me?
  ans:
  - loud and clear, captain.

- que:
  - can you disengage it from the cockpit?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
  ans:
  - i gotta concentrate here.

- que:
  - what's your status?
  ans:
  - almost there.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - you and sid are getting out of here now.

- que:
  - what am i wrong?
  ans:
  - no, i agree.

- que:
  - then why should we try it?
  ans:
  - because we don't need to extract the 8th spirit.

- que:
  - and how do we do that... exactly?
  ans:
  - i can construct the device.

- que:
  - and then what?
  ans:
  - and then we wait.

- que:
  - we wait and see what happens?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - aki?
  ans:
  - i say we go in.

- que:
  - what caused the battle failed, general hein?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid it's only the matter of time before the phantoms develop into immunity to our barriers.

- que:
  - target, sir?
  ans:
  - the phantom crater.

- que:
  - there are so many of them?
  ans:
  - it's the zeus.

- que:
  - aki, gray, are you alright?
  ans:
  - a little shaking.

- que:
  - do you have it?
  ans:
  - the 8th has been destroyed.

- que:
  - what are we going to do now?
  ans:
  - sid, i need to talk to the station.

- que:
  - what is that thing?
  ans:
  - i don't know, sir.

- que:
  - ghosts?
  ans:
  - yes, spirits that are confused, lost and angry.

- que:
  - this is not a good place to be.
  ans:
  - oh right?

- que:
  - definitely not a good place to be.
  ans:
  - what the hell is that?

- que:
  - are you alright?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - sid, do you read me?
  ans:
  - go ahead.

- que:
  - you could destroy our last hope.
  ans:
  - you hear me, sir?

- que:
  - ask them to play nice?
  ans:
  - combat strategy is your area of expertise, not mine.

- que:
  - do you see it?
  ans:
  - yes, a compatible spirit.

- que:
  - which one?
  ans:
  - i have it.

- que:
  - do you hear me, sid?
  ans:
  - the wave pattern is completed.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - give me your overpack.

- que:
  - are you sure you have the final spirit?
  ans:
  - yes, yes.

- que:
  - how can you know that?
  ans:
  - don't worry, the phantom told me.

- que:
  - what are they trying to tell you?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but we are getting her out.

- que:
  - what the hell do you think you are doing?

  ans:
  - i was recruiting native labour for piers and warehouses, sir.

- que:
  - that doesn't mean you have to look like a native, does it?
  ans:
  - i didn't expect to be called to see the admiral, sir.

- que:
  - didn't you see the directive that all personnel be clean shaven?
  ans:
  - i must have missed it, sir.

- que:
  - did the admiral want to see me about my beard?
  ans:
  - eddington, you're being transferred to gavabutu, with the rank of captain.

- que:
  - are you sure you have the right eddington?
  ans:
  - you're being assigned to admiral rockwell torrey as chief of staff.

  - my aide, mr armstrong.
  ans:

- que:
  - mr canfil, you know these mountains?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - could a battalion cross those peaks at night?
  ans:
  - if they didn't have to lug cannons with them.

  - what if an r4d conks out?
  ans:
  - toulebonne sends a spare till it's fixed.

- que:
  - where's the hospital?
  ans:
  - she's in there.

- que:
  - how do admirals feel about nurses?
  ans:
  - the same way captains did.

- que:
  - will there be time for us, out here?
  ans:
  - we'll make time.

- que:

  ans:
  - i'm tired of it.

  - no big deal?
  ans:
  - that's keith's band.

- que:
  - okay, you know what?
  ans:
  - you're not seeing that guy again until i meet him.

- que:
  - are you going to sign this test, or should i just forge it?
  ans:
  - apparently, you kids have forgotten that we are the parents.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - if anybody misses their curfew, or doesn't do their homework, or talks back, or just looks at us wrong, they are getting a spanking.

- que:
  - now who wants to mess with me first?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - guess what, dad?
  ans:
  - keith finally asked me out, but i told him that you had to meet him first.

- que:
  - who the hell broke my putter and tried to superglue it back together?
  ans:
  - it wasn't me.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - do you have any idea how much this cost me?
  ans:
  - i am so pissed right now, i i don't even know what to do.

- que:
  - that is the new policy, right?
  ans:
  - i mean, larry used something of yours without asking.

- que:
  - hey, hillary, maybe he's just afraid that larry is such a fierce warrior, he's going to vanquish him.
  ans:
  - you're not going to hit him?

- que:
  - why are they doing this to me?
  ans:
  - i i don't want to spank them.

  - i just left her at home, in bed.

- que:
  - what's wrong?

  - yes.

- que:
  - so we cancel the show?
  ans:
  - i'd like to speak to huma, please.

- que:
  - what do we do now?
  ans:
  - if it won't give you a heart attack, i could do her part.

- que:
  - but can you act?
  ans:
  - i can lie very well, and i'm used to improvising.

- que:
  - huma, what'll we do?
  ans:
  - we can't wait any longer.

- que:
  - why did you bother?
  ans:
  - i hope you like it.

- que:
  - what world do you think you're living in?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  - your colleagues?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - it's fucking impossible to learn it over the loudspeakers.
  ans:
  - what's up?

- que:
  - you think i'm stupid?
  ans:
  - the loudspeakers helped me remember it.

- que:
  - if you only knew.
  ans:
  - really?

- que:
  - or was that a coincidence too?
  ans:
  - no, it wasn't a coincidence.

  ans:
  - he returned with a box of roses to beg my forgiveness. forgive me, he said, but some things are not forgivable.

- que:
  - are you learning the part too?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - if you know, why ask?
  ans:
  - if you don't want me to tell huma, do it in the bathroom.

- que:
  - you think it's worth it?
  ans:
  - i'd get no work.

- que:
  - rheumatic?
  ans:

  ans:
  - right, only sooner.

- que:
  - what's the line?
  ans:
  - i've heard of getting stuck with a problem.

- que:

  ans:
  - only there's a hiatus between freddy's exit and my entrance.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - i've got it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i can see i'm going to be opening sardines all night.

- que:
  - or, if he did, i didn't hear it.
  ans:
  - where's she gone?

- que:
  - darling, where are you?
  ans:
  - that stuff doesn't eat through glue, just trousers.

- que:
  - you don't think it eats through...?
  ans:
  - someone has broken into my house...... into someone's house, and a young woman is missing.

- que:
  - we've found them.
  ans:
  - are you ok?

- que:
  - in my underwear?
  ans:

  ans:
  - no, we'll struggle through.

- que:
  - some other problem, freddy?
  ans:
  - since we're stopped...

- que:
  - why did i ask?
  ans:
  - i'm stupid about plot.

- que:
  - could i ask another dumb question?
  ans:
  - all of my studies in world drama lie at your disposal.

- que:
  - why is the sheikh philip's double?
  ans:
  - he comes in and we think he's, you know...

- que:
  - but it is a coincidence, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it is kind of a coincidence, freddy, yes.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - interesting.

- que:
  - will the audience get it?
  ans:
  - you show them.

- que:
  - tell her.
  ans:

- que:
  - why brooke?
  ans:
  - it was sweet.

- que:
  - where do you think they've been all weekend?

- que:
  - last line?
  ans:

  - yes and no.

- que:
  - aren't we?
  ans:
  - yes, my lord.

- que:
  - who are they?
  ans:
  - arsonists.

- que:
  - change your mind about the gods?
  ans:
  - if there are gods in this world... they're not here.

- que:
  - this new gladiator, spartacus, is he really a thracian... or are you still passing off greeks?
  ans:
  - he's the real thing, through and through.

- que:
  - any good?
  ans:
  - cinna thinks the world of him.

- que:
  - don't you, cinna?
  ans:
  - because cinna ordered it.

- que:
  - on what would you make a vow?
  ans:
  - on the blood that flows... through my veins and the breath i take...

- que:
  - can you tell there's life after?
  ans:
  - i have faith.

- que:
  - marcus crassus is here... and you left him waiting outside?
  ans:
  - noble crassus.

- que:
  - how may i serve you?
  ans:
  - my friends and i'd appreciate... a private showing of a pair of thracians.

- que:
  - to the death?
  ans:
  - that's an unusual request for a private showing.

- que:
  - don't you agree, slave master?
  ans:
  - a private fight.

- que:
  - who do you want?
  ans:
  - draba.

- que:
  - now, he's a jew, yes?
  ans:
  - yes, i know you want a thracian...

- que:
  - ever seen a jew fight?
  ans:
  - exceptional with the dagger and reputed to be very bright as well.

- que:
  - who else?
  ans:
  - spartacus and polymus.

- que:
  - how do you like them?
  ans:
  - all.

- que:
  - who will you match him with?
  ans:
  - with the african.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - praying.

- que:
  - how do you pray?
  ans:
  - i can show you.

- que:
  - something that we do in our tribe?
  ans:
  - put your mouth on mine and breath your soul into me... and i'll breath mine into you.

- que:
  - what kind of match is that?
  ans:
  - gladiators are animals, pure and simple.

- que:
  - would you like to see?
  ans:
  - bring me the jew before he fights.

- que:
  - they do that to their children?
  ans:
  - if he kills me, he lives.

- que:
  - who chooses to die?
  ans:
  - if a man throw his life away...

- que:
  - will you die any better?
  ans:
  - he will die like a dog, and so will you.

- que:
  - was draba your friend?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did he teach you how to die?
  ans:
  - he taught me how to live.

- que:
  - and what do i get in return?
  ans:
  - treachery.

- que:
  - nordo, can you open the armory?
  ans:
  - lf i have to do it with my teeth.

- que:
  - what do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - invite our brothers to join us.

- que:
  - where's that slaves headed?
  ans:
  - in the hills to the south of here.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - so if attacked, they'd have to fight, man to man.

- que:
  - and who fights better man to man than gladiators?
  ans:
  - crixus, nordo.

- que:
  - should we not greet them?
  ans:
  - apparently there has been an uprising of gladiators in capua.

- que:
  - who are they led by?
  ans:
  - it sounds like a job for an overseer and a pack of dogs.

- que:
  - will the slaves wait?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - but the entire city cohorts?
  ans:
  - three.

- que:
  - under whose command?
  ans:
  - i realize that it is not customary for a man to put his own name.

- que:
  - how are we going to feed them or clothe them... much less train them to fight the roman empire?
  ans:
  - by teaching them to share the burden.

- que:
  - why did you propose glabrus?
  ans:
  - he's as thick as he is vain.

- que:
  - why don't put yourself forward?
  ans:
  - agrippa would have blocked me out of sheer spite.

- que:
  - and to where?
  ans:
  - i want to go home.

- que:
  - can you bend this?
  ans:
  - now all of these.

- que:
  - who will lead us?
  ans:
  - stand up if you want to lead.

- que:
  - what are they?
  ans:
  - whatever we take... we hold together.

- que:
  - we're one tribe then?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is that your will?
  ans:
  - whoever you are... you are blocking the path of a citizen of rome.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - that is what it says.

- que:
  - does that trouble you?
  ans:
  - well, i'll do what i can to raise myself, but i make no promises.

- que:
  - we're going to have a child?
  ans:
  - the slave army's climbing the north wall of the mountain, my lord.

- que:
  - why don't we push on, my lord?
  ans:
  - cut off the slaves before they reach the mountains.

- que:
  - what's a woman doing here?
  ans:
  - she has every right to be here.

- que:
  - do women lead your armies?
  ans:
  - is that why jews...

- que:
  - what's the excuse of the gauls?
  ans:
  - david has news for us.

- que:
  - what's your plan?
  ans:
  - i don't have one.

- que:
  - you don't have a plan?
  ans:
  - from the moment i stood up in the training yard...

- que:
  - why must i?
  ans:
  - i'm no different from any of you.

- que:
  - that we're all equal?
  ans:
  - yes, but...

- que:
  - and why should you?
  ans:
  - you're the only possible choice.

- que:
  - within the soul you say i have?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - my lord, is it true you've given the troops permission to camp... without building the usual defensive fortifications?
  ans:
  - the men are tired and i am tired.

- que:
  - how is it that you were spared?
  ans:
  - i don't know why they chose me.

- que:
  - what do we have to talk to him about?
  ans:
  - a lot.

- que:
  - you here to do business or flatter me?
  ans:
  - you've done well.

- que:
  - for yourself?
  ans:
  - for all of us.

- que:
  - so how many trunks of gold?
  ans:
  - at least five more like this.

- que:
  - when we are ready how do i signal you?
  ans:
  - get to the coast and fly this... where it can be seen from the sea.

- que:
  - orsino or crixus?
  ans:
  - either one.

- que:
  - is this wise?
  ans:
  - as long as they obey the laws it's better to let them have their way.

- que:
  - with what?
  ans:
  - thanks to your haste, we'll be 3 months rebuilding the garrison.

- que:
  - and while we do that, what would rome do?
  ans:
  - recall their legions.

- que:
  - what do you propose that we do?
  ans:
  - i say we make the price of rebellion... painfully clear.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - two hundred roman slaves... picked at random... and burned alive this morning.

- que:
  - varinia?
  ans:
  - she must rest.

- que:
  - if we let them go?
  ans:
  - it pains me to say it... but crassus is right.

- que:
  - if spartacus defeats this army and turns on rome... where will your precious little democracy be then?
  ans:
  - it reminds me of the nestros valley where i grew up.

- que:
  - you still have kin there?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - he was the village headsman.

- que:
  - did you notice on the road how quiet it was?
  ans:
  - the slaves have stopped joining us.

- que:
  - can we get around them?
  ans:
  - they've picked their site well.

- que:
  - and who's their general?
  ans:
  - publius maximus.

- que:
  - what do we know about him?
  ans:
  - publius runs his army with a firm hand.

- que:
  - how do we fight that?
  ans:
  - i remember a story about hannibal fighting a rock.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - those we didn't kill we drove off.

- que:
  - in which direction?
  ans:
  - south, i think.

- que:
  - what are you doing out here?
  ans:
  - thinking.

- que:
  - am i in danger?
  ans:
  - she's carrying my child.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - crixus.

- que:
  - why should we leave?
  ans:
  - rome threw their best at us...

- que:
  - why should we run?
  ans:
  - but let's not settle for a little plunder.

- que:
  - what kind of man am i dealing with?
  ans:
  - everybody blames me for this mess.

- que:
  - spartacus?
  ans:
  - yes, yes.

- que:
  - you mean varinia?
  ans:
  - that bitch from hell disguised as an angel.

- que:
  - how did he become a slave?
  ans:
  - they say that... as a young boy... he watched his father crucified.

- que:
  - how can i desert them?
  ans:
  - you are an honorable man.

- que:
  - don't the legions traditionally cheer rome when they depart?
  ans:
  - crassus thinks he is rome.

- que:
  - orsino?
  ans:
  - if you betray us i'll find you wherever you go...

- que:
  - how many legions?
  ans:
  - i count six standards.

- que:
  - commander?
  ans:
  - we caught one of their scouts.

- que:
  - you're uneasy, my lord?
  ans:
  - it is a warrior's answer...

- que:
  - and how do you know?
  ans:
  - we've met this man.

- que:
  - is that wise?
  ans:
  - both glabrus and publius played into his hands.

- que:
  - but in order to do that he had to split his forces.
  ans:
  - why share the glory that could be ours alone?

- que:
  - how long do you think before they reach our front lines?
  ans:
  - kill them.

- que:
  - who would throw away a fortune?
  ans:
  - aristocrats.

- que:
  - what would rome pay to have them back?
  ans:
  - we could live well on the ransom.

- que:
  - roman citizens?
  ans:
  - discipline distinguishes the roman army... from every other army in the world.

- que:
  - and where is spartacus now?
  ans:
  - traveling south, tracked by my troops.

- que:
  - do you think that spartacus will sit... and wait patiently for him to arrive?
  ans:
  - he is a contaminating parasite.

- que:
  - the question is what?
  ans:
  - orsino.

- que:
  - may i offer you something to eat?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and why would you conclude that?
  ans:
  - because it's all he can do.

- que:
  - how long do you think it will take them to get here?
  ans:
  - by tomorrow.

- que:
  - where did you acquire the arrogance to believe that you could... challenge the undefeated roman empire?
  ans:
  - i have you to thank.

- que:
  - he inspired you?
  ans:
  - he showed me how to fight back.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - my scouts tell me that pompey has been recalled.

- que:
  - what glory will be left for you when he arrives?
  ans:
  - i will destroy your army... and then i will wipe away even the memory of your existence... from the face of this earth.

- que:
  - how could you crucify?
  ans:
  - the romans need to be reminded that we are not beaten.

- que:
  - that's supposed to justify it?
  ans:
  - north.

- que:
  - may i ask the cost to bring that?
  ans:
  - well, it was very expensive... but it was worth it.

- que:
  - attack crassus?
  ans:
  - insane.

- que:
  - who led us to the trap at rhegium?
  ans:
  - where my feet take me.

- que:
  - have you enough food?
  ans:
  - lf we don't, romans will give us.

- que:
  - who else can say that?
  ans:
  - no one.

- que:
  - where are the gauls headed?
  ans:
  - they're making camp on the shores of lake lucania.

- que:
  - the child is well?
  ans:
  - i think he will be a blacksmith, the way he hammers on me.

- que:
  - and be a slave again?
  ans:
  - you haven't the right to ask that of me.

- que:
  - not to your son?
  ans:
  - you were right, varinia.

- que:
  - and if you die, who will tell that story?
  ans:
  - we think he was a close friend of spartacus.

- que:
  - and i have stamped out... the greatest threat... that rome has known since carthage.
  ans:
  - what is your name?

- que:
  - and i am to be rewarded... with some trivial, secondary honor?
  ans:
  - senators, this is a day for rome to rejoice.

- que:
  - and now for candidates could there be... any more qualified, more deserving... than these two glorious heroes?
  ans:
  - and therefore i propose... that pompey and crassus both be made consul.

- que:
  - what was he like?
  ans:
  - he was just a man.

- que:
  - if you already have the answer to your question then why ask it?
  ans:
  - because you waste your tears on him.

- que:
  - then why does he still matter to you?
  ans:
  - spartacus was something the world has never seen before.

- que:
  - do you still have nothing to say?
  ans:
  - i will be back.

- que:
  - don't you mean crassus?
  ans:
  - caesar is the real beneficiary here.

- que:
  - what have we done?
  ans:
  - now tell me some dirt.

- que:
  - even now, this varinia?
  ans:
  - war trophy, i imagine.

- que:
  - can i have a drink?
  ans:
  - help yourself.

- que:
  - are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - it would be suicide.

- que:
  - you know why i am so much more popular than you, crassus?
  ans:
  - because it's only natural to prefer the rising sun... to the one that sets.

- que:
  - why have you done this?
  ans:
  - but the more i thought about it, well...

- que:
  - a foolish old man's last gesture... of redemption maybe?
  ans:
  - after i sobered up yesterday...

- que:
  - do you know what i think?
  ans:
  - i think that you fought for your freedom... for your children's lives... the honor of your women... and all that is good in the world.

- que:
  - and rome fought for what?
  ans:
  - the whip and the cross.

- que:
  - what is your son's name?
  ans:
  - spartacus.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - you're safe now.

- que:
  - and how does the story end?
  ans:
  - i don't know, spartacus.

- que:
  - and if you die, who will tell that story?
  ans:
  - live so that i will live.

- que:
  - did you see the look he gave you, varinia?
  ans:
  - i didn't.

- que:
  - agrippa.
  ans:
  - what sort of look?

- que:
  - fishing for votes?
  ans:
  - no, just enjoying our democratic way of life.

- que:
  - any news from spain?
  ans:
  - a great victory by pompey.

- que:
  - another?
  ans:
  - the man is positively boring in his triumphs.

- que:
  - what brings you up from capua?
  ans:
  - the same thing as you, i would imagine.

- que:
  - a modest man from the country?
  ans:
  - yours is widely known as the finest gladiatorial school in all ltaly.

- que:
  - why, batiatus, are you in love?
  ans:
  - it would be a close vote.

- que:
  - am l?
  ans:
  - i suppose i might be.

- que:
  - some say he can't.
  ans:
  - what kind of a place is this?

- que:
  - you're thracians?
  ans:
  - the crowd likes thracians.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because i might meet you in the arena, and then i will kill you.

- que:
  - why wait?
  ans:
  - you'll get plenty of chances to fight.

- que:
  - who hasn't?
  ans:
  - crixus of the big nose.

- que:
  - where did you learn to fight?
  ans:
  - when a roman asks you a question, you answer, slave.

- que:
  - why is it that the rich are always so keen on reform after they've made their fortune and not before?
  ans:
  - the republic was a fine form of government when rome was a backwater city state.

- que:
  - or by pompey?
  ans:
  - well, plato did say that leadership must be left to the educated.

- que:
  - you've heard what they say about him?
  ans:
  - every woman's man and every man's woman.

- que:
  - was it something i said?
  ans:
  - they have spirit but no real talent.

- que:
  - so you think they're just lucky?
  ans:
  - and cinna, this boy was very expensive.

- que:
  - how's your nose?
  ans:
  - you got lucky.

- que:
  - so where did you fight romans?
  ans:
  - thrace.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - gaul, where i was caught.

- que:
  - you rebelled?
  ans:
  - two times.

- que:
  - why did it fail?
  ans:
  - it amuses the romans to turn us into fishermen.

- que:
  - draba, they ever pit the knife against the spear?
  ans:
  - tomorrow some of you have the honor of fighting in the arena in capua.

- que:
  - i don't believe in the gods.
  ans:
  - what's the matter, thracian?

- que:
  - you don't believe in the gods?
  ans:
  - when i look at the heavens i see only stars.

- que:
  - so what do you believe in?
  ans:
  - us.

- que:
  - what happens tonight?
  ans:
  - war, little thracian.

- que:
  - what are you called?
  ans:
  - you look cold.

- que:
  - where are they going?
  ans:
  - capua.

- que:
  - the thracian, the one they call spartacus. ls he any good?
  ans:
  - couldn't say.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - all the gladiators here are strong men.

- que:
  - you were with him last night?
  ans:
  - yes and no.

- que:
  - aren't we?
  ans:
  - yes, my lord.

- que:
  - on the crosses who are they?
  ans:
  - arsonists.

- que:
  - change your mind about the gods?
  ans:
  - lf there are gods in this world, they're not here.

- que:
  - ls he really a thracian or are you still passing off greeks?
  ans:
  - he's the real thing, through and through.

- que:
  - any good?
  ans:
  - cinna thinks the world of him.

- que:
  - don't you, cinna?
  ans:
  - because cinna ordered it.

- que:
  - and in the life beyond.
  ans:
  - will you marry me?

- que:
  - how do you know there is a life beyond?
  ans:
  - i have faith.

- que:
  - some...
  ans:
  - marcus crassus is here, and you left him waiting outside?

- que:
  - how may i serve you?
  ans:
  - my friends and i would appreciate a private showing of a pair of thracians.

- que:
  - to the death?
  ans:
  - that's an unusual request for a private showing.

- que:
  - don't you agree, slave master?
  ans:
  - a private fight.

- que:
  - who do you want?
  ans:
  - yes, i know you wanted a thracian...

- que:
  - ever seen a jew fight?
  ans:
  - exceptional with the dagger and reputed to be very bright, as well.

- que:
  - who else?
  ans:
  - er...

- que:
  - how do you like them?
  ans:
  - all except that one.

- que:
  - who will you match him with?
  ans:
  - the african.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - praying.

- que:
  - how do you pray?
  ans:
  - i can show you.

- que:
  - something that we do in our tribe?
  ans:
  - put your mouth on mine and breathe your soul into me, and i'll breathe mine into you.

  ans:
  - gladiators are animals, pure and simple.

- que:
  - would you like to see?
  ans:
  - bring me the jew before he fights.

- que:
  - they do that to their children?
  ans:
  - lf he kills me, he lives.

- que:
  - ls it true that draba didn't kill any of the romans?
  ans:
  - lf a man must throw his life away, he could die better than that.

- que:
  - will you die any better?
  ans:
  - he will die like a dog and so will you.

- que:
  - was draba your friend?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did he teach you how to die?
  ans:
  - he taught me how to live.

- que:
  - and what do i get in return?
  ans:
  - treachery.

- que:
  - nordo, can you open the armory?
  ans:
  - lf i have to break the door with my teeth.

- que:
  - what do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - lnvite our brothers to join us.

- que:
  - where is that slave scum headed?
  ans:
  - ln the hills to the south of here.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - so if attacked, they'd have to fight, man to man.

- que:
  - and who fights better man to man than gladiators, huh?
  ans:
  - crixus, nordo...

- que:
  - i propose that we send the city cohorts to crush this rebellion immediately.
  ans:
  - should we not greet them?

- que:
  - who are they led by?
  ans:
  - it is a job for an overseer and a pack of dogs.

- que:
  - will the slaves wait?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - but the entire city cohorts?
  ans:
  - three.

- que:
  - under whose command?
  ans:
  - i realize that it is not customary for a man to put his own name forward.

- que:
  - how are we going to feed them or clothe them, much less train them to fight the roman empire?
  ans:
  - by teaching them to share the burden.

- que:
  - why did you propose glabrus?
  ans:
  - he's as thick as he is vain.

- que:
  - why didn't you put yourself forward?
  ans:
  - agrippa would have blocked me out of spite.

- que:
  - and go where?
  ans:
  - i want to go home.

- que:
  - can you bend this?
  ans:
  - now all of these.

- que:
  - who will lead us?
  ans:
  - stand up if you want to lead.

- que:
  - what are they?
  ans:
  - whatever we take we hold together.

- que:
  - we're one tribe, then?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - ls that your will?
  ans:
  - whoever you are, you are blocking the path of a citizen of rome.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - that is what it says.

- que:
  - does that trouble you?
  ans:
  - well, i'll do what i can to raise myself but i make no promises.

- que:
  - we're going to have a child?
  ans:
  - the slave army is climbing the north wall of the mountain, my lord.

- que:
  - cut off the slaves before the mountains?
  ans:
  - it's cold, i'm tired and i'm hungry.

- que:
  - what's a woman doing here?
  ans:
  - she has every right.

- que:
  - what's the excuse of the gauls?
  ans:
  - david has news for us.

- que:
  - what's your plan?
  ans:
  - i don't have one.

- que:

  ans:
  - that's a mistake.

- que:
  - what do you base that on?
  ans:
  - why don't you check the explosives from maximov's boat... with the kid who got killed last night.

  ans:
  - that's what i love about you, sandra.

- que:
  - and got me to come to barcelona so you could frame me for it?
  ans:
  - you're my scapegoat.

  ans:
  - because human life is temporary, sandra.

- que:
  - you want your paintings, victor?
  ans:
  - go get them.

- que:

  ans:
  - another chapter in an endless struggle that's grinding into its seventh year.

- que:
  - but who of us can forget the giant struggle on the plains of fianga?

  ans:
  - pier 5.

- que:
  - no, are you going to give me one?
  ans:
  - no, get your own bloody gun.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - we couldn't find him.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - hello, it's me.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - i'm trapped inside the container with the boy.

- que:

  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:

  ans:
  - it's cold in here.

  ans:

- que:

  ans:
  - lights everywhere.

- que:
  - the boy?
  ans:
  - medallion.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - wow.

- que:
  - where did you go?
  ans:
  - excuse me, nurse.

- que:
  - would you mind if we have a few moments with the boy?
  ans:
  - you know, the man outside says you're not eating.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - feeling.

- que:
  - bumpity bumpity?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - half for me?
  ans:
  - nice lad.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - that nurse....

- que:
  - right, sir.
  ans:
  - what the heck?

- que:
  - watson, are you there?
  ans:
  - i'm not here.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - snakehead's men.

- que:
  - i mean, i think i mentioned that eddie wasn't the only one with a black belt.
  ans:
  - watson, you did all this alone?

- que:
  - so you're all right?
  ans:
  - perfect.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - go on, hit me.

- que:
  - for real?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - harder.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - oh, god.

- que:
  - did it hurt?
  ans:
  - of course it hurt.

- que:
  - you know how many forms i have to fill out if i fire my gun?
  ans:
  - absolutely not.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - i mean, still....

- que:
  - why you couldn't retrieve one small boy?
  ans:
  - sir...... this might sound crazy...... but i emptied a whole clip into that chinese cop and he still wouldn't die.

- que:
  - what chinese cop?
  ans:
  - that's eddie yang.

- que:
  - have you ever seen this before?
  ans:
  - doesn't ring a bell.

- que:
  - doctor?
  ans:
  - i recognize the fish.

- que:
  - you got it from a kid, didn't you?
  ans:
  - y es.

- que:
  - good luck.
  ans:
  - so where's the other half?

- que:
  - this snakehead chap, is he after the medallion or the boy?
  ans:
  - by the way, take good care of that kid.

- que:
  - what did you have?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - that good?
  ans:
  - you don't like....

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i can't cook anything else.

- que:
  - jai...... do you not understand that eddie's not coming back?
  ans:
  - i pulled him back.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - eddie?
  ans:
  - i told you he wasn't dead.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - his order is ruled by reverence for life.

- que:
  - and then who would bring you back, chosen one?
  ans:
  - pitiful mortal.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - to become immortal, you need both halves of the medallion.

- que:
  - with the boy and the medallion, he could....
  ans:
  - where's the other half?

- que:
  - he could become like you?
  ans:
  - yes, but he needs the whole medallion...... and he only has half.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - my family.

- que:
  - they're all right.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - charlotte?
  ans:
  - i have something i have to tell you.

- que:
  - yes, dear?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm fine, dear.

- que:
  - what the?
  ans:
  - there you are.

- que:
  - guns are very dangerous things, all right?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - where'd he go?
  ans:
  - we meet again...... eddie yang.

- que:
  - where's the boy?
  ans:
  - my guest is no concern of yours.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - be careful.

- que:
  - excuse me.
  ans:
  - jai, are you all right?

- que:
  - we can take whatever we choose.
  ans:
  - you looking for something?

- que:
  - i mean, what difference can a single human life like hers make to us?
  ans:
  - we are immortal.

- que:
  - can you?
  ans:
  - it's your turn.

- que:
  - what's that for?
  ans:
  - of course...... when he came back, he was naked.

- que:
  - i don't suppose you'd consider a rub on your medallion?
  ans:
  - i really am.

- que:
  - quiet on the set.
  ans:
  - hello?

- que:
  - are cameras ready?
  ans:
  - cameras are ready.

- que:
  - can you overlap that line for me?
  ans:
  - eddie yang.

- que:
  - will you say action, or am i just...?
  ans:
  - i did.

- que:
  - three months and not so much as a phone call?
  ans:
  - that made me so nervous.

- que:
  - you now, how?
  ans:
  - it's giscard.

- que:
  - what about snakehead?
  ans:
  - snakehead is not here yet.

- que:
  - what about ken?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - pete?
  ans:
  - pete is just right beside me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's no, you no.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - the bottom.

- que:
  - are you doing on purpose?
  ans:
  - try it again, claire.

- que:
  - how do you plan to get inside it?
  ans:
  - we're pretty sure we found a way in.

- que:
  - i'll assist you.
  ans:
  - do you really believe we haven't considered that?

- que:
  - what have we missed?
  ans:
  - the reptilians took the weapon.

- que:
  - have they launched it?
  ans:
  - we don't know.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - reptilians, insectoids...

- que:
  - where's corporal hawkins?
  ans:
  - the sphere had an automated defense mechanism.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - we are trying to determine their location.

- que:
  - what about the aquatics?
  ans:
  - their actions aren't easy to predict, but so far they seem determined not to take sides.

- que:
  - you believe they'll use her to decrypt the arming sequence?
  ans:
  - she'll never cooperate.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - i'm fond of hoshi as well.

- que:
  - any luck?
  ans:
  - there's a great deal of data to analyze, but we've made some progress.

- que:
  - integral how?
  ans:
  - i believe they act as control spheres, allowing the network to operate in concert.

- que:
  - if we can damage one of them, would it disrupt the entire grid?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - why have they stopped?
  ans:
  - they could've been halfway to earth by now.

- que:
  - how quickly can we get there?
  ans:
  - that wouldn't be wise.

- que:
  - would the aquatics be a match for them?
  ans:
  - their ships are extremely powerful.

- que:
  - can they afford to sit back and do nothing?
  ans:
  - let me talk to them.

- que:
  - so we should leave our fate in the hands of the reptilians and insectoids?
  ans:
  - i disagree.

- que:
  - how long do they plan to keep us waiting?
  ans:
  - you have to deal with the aquatics on their terms.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - my species doesn't like the water.

- que:
  - and if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime...?
  ans:
  - the reptilians and the insectoids cannot deploy the weapon on their own.

- que:
  - so, you'd rather sit back and do nothing?
  ans:
  - captain! while they condemn all five of your species to extinction.

- que:
  - is it here in the expanse?
  ans:
  - in case you haven't noticed, the spheres are turning it into a trans dimensional wasteland.

- que:
  - have they ever tried to disable the spheres?
  ans:
  - because we've found a way.

- que:
  - do you understand what we want you to do?
  ans:
  - i'm to bypass the aquatic encryption protocols.

- que:
  - and i'm trying not to make a liar out of him.
  ans:
  - are you?

- que:
  - what do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - you've dismissed all of my proposals.

- que:
  - why don't we take another crack at this?
  ans:
  - the council has disbanded.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - you've seen more than enough detail to learn how to meddle in our affairs to turn the xindi species against each other.

- que:
  - what they used to connect the spheres?
  ans:
  - that's what we're thinking.

- que:
  - any word?
  ans:
  - it's only been three hours.

- que:
  - what's to prevent us from building another one?
  ans:
  - i knew degra for many years.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - we will help you intercept the weapon.

- que:
  - how do these developments affect the timeline?
  ans:
  - it's difficult to say.

- que:
  - is there another problem?
  ans:
  - quite the opposite.

- que:
  - the third launch code?
  ans:
  - we have complete access.

- que:
  - have you assembled your boarding party?
  ans:
  - ready to deploy on your command.

- que:
  - would you like to go over my rescue plan?
  ans:
  - first, i'd like to know if... we have a problem.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - if you blame me for the corporal's death.

- que:
  - permission to speak freely?
  ans:
  - i've never liked putting my people under someone else's command.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - you may buy me a drink, if you wish.

- que:
  - can you imagine the look on soval's face when he sees her in a starfleet uniform?
  ans:
  - please let me be there.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - a vortex is opening.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - bearing 2 7 9, range 4, 000 kilometers.

- que:
  - were you expecting reinforcements?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - feel like taking them on?
  ans:
  - give me the word, sir.

- que:
  - can you get a transporter lock?
  ans:
  - she's somewhere on the first three decks.

- que:
  - can you hold your position?
  ans:
  - affirmative.

- que:
  - and the anomalies?
  ans:
  - they've disabled three of the aquatic ships.

- que:
  - what's your status?
  ans:
  - we've completed the arming sequence.

- que:
  - what about the anomalies?
  ans:
  - i said, take us in.

- que:
  - how's ensign sato?
  ans:
  - her bio signs are stable.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - she knows the team.

- que:
  - how long before it reaches earth?
  ans:
  - ten hours.

- que:
  - could an aquatic ship reach it in time?
  ans:
  - doubtful.

- que:
  - what are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - the ship isn't well armed.

- que:
  - are you ready?
  ans:
  - i believe so.

- que:
  - how is she?
  ans:
  - stable.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - i won't risk any more interference.

- que:
  - can we pass through there?
  ans:
  - our ships weren't designed for twist pressures over one googol fluxoms.

- que:
  - hey, i can see it's a water gun.
  ans:
  - why's everybody talk back all the time?

- que:
  - just a second, sir.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - that's three hot dogs and a sausage roll, to eat here?
  ans:
  - at this, i mean.

- que:
  - what, the vulgar rocket ship?
  ans:
  - we sold it to some russian scientist type for top dollar.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - vladimir something, i forget.

- que:
  - where's this vladimir live then?
  ans:
  - chanistanya nuclear plant, i think.

- que:
  - who the hell gave you permission to sell the ship, you son of a bitch?
  ans:
  - we're off to russia, numbskull.

- que:
  - kooling system problems, but that's what you do best, right?
  ans:
  - go check out the reaktor chamber.

- que:
  - chernobyl. why's zat sound familiar?
  ans:
  - the negotiations with the russian president had also gone well.

- que:
  - are we all set to go?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - so you're the famous emperor pirk?
  ans:
  - this is me, in all my glory.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - no, they just whined about famine and overpopulation and stuff.

- que:
  - it had one occupant... human.
  ans:
  - what's this racket?

- que:
  - how did a one man craft get this far from earth?
  ans:
  - we saw a ship in epsilon ouadrant.

- que:
  - we had a meeting at two o'clock.
  ans:
  - huh?

- que:
  - didn't it occur to you it might be two pm, wiseguy?
  ans:
  - your expression was ambiguous, sir.

- que:
  - what about it?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, get to the point.

- que:
  - any questions?
  ans:
  - meanwhile in a parallel universe...

- que:
  - what're you going on about?
  ans:
  - lt kefir took a star flurry for a drunken joyride last night.

- que:
  - why didn't you stop him?
  ans:
  - i was so dru... dreadfully tired.

- que:
  - where's kefir now?
  ans:
  - in the morning, i sent a patrol out.

- que:
  - where did that ship come from?
  ans:
  - dunno.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the prophecies of the minibar are coming true.

- que:
  - now, let's get back to reality, huh?
  ans:
  - an itching nose must be scratched.

- que:
  - how many?
  ans:
  - sir, we're being hailed.

- que:
  - is the planet habitable?
  ans:
  - not according to the scanners, sir.

- que:
  - where are you guys from, anyway?
  ans:
  - this station is neutral territory.

- que:
  - we haven't been here before?
  ans:
  - emperor, i assume we have arrived in a mirror dimension of our own world.

- que:
  - so do you know where their earth is?
  ans:
  - in theory, yes, assuming that our star charts have the same stars.

- que:
  - tell me, can we beat them?
  ans:
  - given that we have deflector plates and they do not, it is possible...

- que:
  - don't shoot, we have over 250, 000 civilians here.
  ans:
  - yes, or no?

- que:
  - why don't you bring your crew over for some shore leave?
  ans:
  - well... lemme consider this.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i feel it in my bones, we won't be coming back.

- que:
  - oh yeah?
  ans:
  - he couldn't stand defeat.

- que:
  - where would you like to start, sir?
  ans:
  - naah...

- que:
  - wait a minute... what's that?
  ans:
  - nothing, just a screen saver.

- que:
  - where's captain giddyup?
  ans:
  - he was feeling unwell, and had to leave the ship under my command.

- que:
  - my sled...
  ans:
  - how about i'll just scoot off?

- que:
  - i'll see to it that you die slowly, and have time to regret everything.
  ans:
  - going somewhere, emperor?

- que:
  - hayday to fleet.
  ans:
  - didn't anyone ever tell you your bootlaces are too long?

- que:
  - additionally, our twinkle beams are powerless against their flagship.
  ans:
  - are your crews back from r& r yet?

- que:
  - what the hell... are we armed with twinklers or flashlights?
  ans:
  - light balls seem to work better, but the kickstart only has nine left.

- que:
  - and where is our friend the kickstart?
  ans:
  - unknown, sir. the blackout caused the targeting computer to reboot, so we lost lock on.

- que:
  - lt. makarov, how are the repairs?
  ans:
  - it'll be open in 10 minutes, sir.

- que:
  - that russkie coward been holding back again?
  ans:
  - if we ask capt fukov to deliver his light balls to us, we can close in...

- que:
  - what've you done?
  ans:
  - not one hit, but your ship is in pieces.

- que:
  - come again?
  ans:
  - you're breaking up.

- que:
  - should we withdraw to regroup?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - have you located the kickstart yet?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - this is the light ball loader, what do i do with light balls?
  ans:
  - ah, the emperor. we meet at last.

- que:
  - erm, i take it that the defense grid has been activated?
  ans:
  - it would be, if there was anything left of it.

- que:
  - are you drunk?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i disconnected the cooling system.

- que:
  - wanna drink?
  ans:
  - babel 1 3 surrenders unconditionally.

- que:
  - but don't you think it'd be better to shoot from a closer range?
  ans:
  - beams traveling across all that space would waste a lot of energy.

- que:
  - we need to hurry, things are so hot.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - did you inform the fleet or what?
  ans:
  - yeah, captain carlo answered.

- que:
  - who's carlo?
  ans:
  - critical mass in 38 seconds.

- que:
  - info, where the hell are we, anyway?
  ans:
  - one moment.

- que:
  - what the hell?
  ans:
  - this end of the maggot hole must have shifted in time space.

- que:
  - how about letting us know where the hell we are?
  ans:
  - hawaii, on earth.

- que:
  - so where are all the surfers and hula hula dancers, smart guy?
  ans:
  - some 1 1, 000 years in the future.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i assume the maggot hole put us on earth, during the ice age.

- que:
  - how about shooting ourselves before the twinklers freeze?
  ans:
  - in a low power mode, i believe i can make it until the 21st century, and prevent the fateful invasion campaign from taking place.

- que:
  - i can't believe you're moving.
  ans:
  - so that none of this ever happened?

- que:
  - do you know what happens to girls who start high school with no best friend, no guy, and low social standing?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - i never truly had an image, did i?
  ans:
  - start now.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - i thought we were done with junior high.

- que:
  - you read all these books?
  ans:
  - yeah, many times.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - i'm doing the dance.
  ans:
  - hey, hey, what's this?

- que:
  - the high school dance?
  ans:
  - we used to be best friends.

- que:
  - so this is our future?
  ans:
  - your future.

- que:
  - how am i supposed to do high school without you?
  ans:
  - there it is... the high school lunch spot.

- que:
  - isn't it great?
  ans:
  - he can't see me, not at all.

- que:
  - we've got ladybug cups...
  ans:
  - stuff?

- que:
  - ladybug plates... and a ladybug pi?
  ans:
  - ata.

- que:
  - aren't these antenna boppers just a hoot, hannah?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - what happened to his car?
  ans:
  - repossessed.

- que:
  - and why not?
  ans:
  - because we don't need a babysitter.

- que:
  - that, who is supposed to be at college setting a good example for his younger sister?
  ans:
  - yeah, well, college...

- que:
  - can you knock?
  ans:
  - actually, i need 20.

- que:
  - can i borrow 50 bucks?
  ans:
  - get a job.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - fried twinkies.

- que:
  - are you sure this is okay?
  ans:
  - have fun, and while you're gone, my love...

- que:
  - oh, honey, why don't you just relax tonight?
  ans:
  - our water's fine.

- que:
  - fine?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - i'm finally back on speaking terms with the mulligans, okay?
  ans:
  - mom, go.

- que:
  - what do you think they do for fun?
  ans:
  - we're skipping the dance.

- que:
  - this is where we're going instead of the dance?
  ans:
  - get out.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah, really.

- que:
  - have you forgotten who i am?
  ans:
  - let me think.

- que:
  - liz?
  ans:
  - change in plan.

- que:
  - so... who's responsible for all the sound?
  ans:
  - you're not our usual rent a cop.

- que:
  - may i?
  ans:
  - it's a coke.

- que:
  - what's with this guy?
  ans:
  - let me get it this time.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - todd and i hooked up.

  - dude, you never heard of the dog star?
  ans:
  - it's called sirius.

- que:
  - wait, you know about this, too?
  ans:
  - my grandma used to tell me stories.

- que:
  - you expect me to believe that there's a planet out there made up of only dogs?
  ans:
  - we don't expect much from your species.

- que:
  - pardon me, but you were saying something about a mission?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - what, like a report card?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:

  - that is crazy.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - isn't that crazy?
  ans:
  - super crazy.

- que:
  - you don't honestly think that dogs are in charge...
  ans:

- que:
  - when did these human dog relationships start anyway?
  ans:
  - thousands of years ago.

- que:
  - friend?
  ans:
  - dogs don't need friends.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - i'm okay.

- que:
  - why do you do that?
  ans:
  - because i need sleep.

- que:
  - why do you turn around like that?
  ans:
  - enough with the questions.

- que:
  - hubble?
  ans:
  - just one more.

- que:
  - how could dogs run an entire planet all on their own?
  ans:
  - i mean, no offense, but you guys don't have that much intelligence.

- que:
  - who's been teaching who all day long, mr. genius?
  ans:
  - you may know about where you live, but i know a lot more about where i live.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because, honey, you do not want to deal with me until i've had my day at the beauty parlor.

- que:
  - so, what do you think, mr. space dog?
  ans:
  - you're all pets.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - now i have no choice.

  ans:
  - we can't flunk.

- que:
  - i make my report, and i go.
  ans:
  - maybe if you helped us refresh our memory a little?

- que:
  - what do you mean, go?
  ans:
  - mission command will send a retriever for me eventually.

- que:
  - who are we kidding?
  ans:
  - we could only dream of being as dignified as hubble.

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - tomorrow, you start getting serious.

- que:
  - i know.
  ans:

  ans:
  - i can't wait to get started on the new place in metro village.

- que:
  - so soon?
  ans:
  - it's our dream home, honey.

- que:
  - and besides, every time we move, we get a nicer place, right?
  ans:
  - but this place seems nice enough to me.

- que:
  - honey, can you move out?
  ans:
  - i want to get the painting by itself.

- que:
  - where were you?
  ans:
  - with my mom.

- que:
  - why do dogs howl at the moon?
  ans:
  - only coyotes do that, but it's not the moon.

- que:
  - sirius?
  ans:
  - just to the left, two stars over.

- que:
  - so when that retriever you talked about comes for you, you're planning on going back with him?
  ans:

  - hey, was that a ball?
  ans:

- que:
  - why do you hang out with them?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - could you watch the dogs?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna check on hubble.

- que:
  - why did you step in like that?
  ans:
  - they were throwing rocks at you.

- que:
  - why would you put yourself at risk for me?
  ans:
  - because... you're my dog.

- que:
  - besides, that's what friends do, right?
  ans:
  - you backed me up, too.

- que:
  - why would i do a stupid thing like that?
  ans:
  - i think they wanna play ball.

- que:
  - doesn't your dog wanna play?
  ans:
  - he's fine.

- que:

  - this looks like my house, but it is different.

- que:
  - is she out shopping with martin now?
  ans:
  - david, she can never come home... because 2, 000 years have passed, and she is no longer living.

- que:
  - if you can bring back other people, why can't you bring back her?
  ans:
  - because we can only bring back people... whose bodies we dig up from the ice.

  ans:
  - i don't understand.

  - what did i do to your feelings?
  ans:
  - you did it to my hand.

- que:
  - we are rightly proud of it, but what does it amount to?
  ans:
  - sheila, open.

- que:
  - love?
  ans:
  - but we ship thousands of lover models every month.

- que:
  - a robot child who will genuinely love... the parent or parents it imprints on... with a love that will never end.
  ans:
  - what is love?

- que:
  - a child substitute mecha?
  ans:
  - but a mecha with a mind, with neuronal feedback.

- que:
  - a robot that dreams?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - but isn't the real conundrum, can you get a human to love them back?
  ans:
  - ours will be a perfect child caught in a freeze frame... always loving, never ill, never changing.

- que:
  - it's a moral question, isn't it?
  ans:
  - the oldest one of all.

- que:
  - i mean, inside he's like all the rest, isn't he?
  ans:
  - a hundred miles of fiber, yeah.

- que:
  - would you like me to sleep now?
  ans:
  - uh, well, it's late, you know.

- que:
  - how how late do they let you stay up?
  ans:
  - i can never go to sleep.

- que:

  ans:
  - frenchy winkler.

- que:
  - where did you learn the secret of your baking?
  ans:
  - it's all i can cook, that and linguine with turkey meatballs.

- que:
  - sir, how is your cookie?
  ans:
  - i don't know, it's baked with nutmeg or something.

- que:
  - who, the rat?
  ans:
  - funny.

- que:
  - the other day i was in deep and my hat went out.
  ans:
  - you've been digging for weeks, when you gonna get somewhere?

- que:
  - i knew we were going the wrong way!
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - hey, look, i'm not trying to ruin anybody's life, ok?
  ans:
  - then, give us a break.

- que:
  - think i could get a piece of the action?
  ans:
  - i don't mind paying off the cops.

- que:
  - yeah, and that word is?
  ans:
  - and, uh... we, uh... the cookies have a wonderful fresh smell and that's put on with a chemical spray.

- que:
  - this is your office?
  ans:
  - yeah, this is where i operate.

- que:
  - um, how much are you worth?
  ans:
  - oh, plenty.

- que:
  - how much?
  ans:
  - between you and me.

- que:
  - why did you decide to go into baking so late in life?
  ans:
  - i thought they were bsing me.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah, cos someone gives you something they cooked you always say you enjoy it even if you threw up, so, you know.

- que:
  - what are your duties as chairman?
  ans:
  - the board meets twice a week and we take up issues.

- que:
  - issues?
  ans:
  - yeah, facts, problems, things like that.

- que:
  - what problems does an overnight success like sunset farms face?
  ans:
  - i figured if a guy's staring at a naked piece of tail, he sees the breasts and the legs, he's gonna salivate.

- que:
  - pablo?
  ans:
  - well, all the chocolate chips are put in by hand and that's really hard on the back and the leg muscles.

- que:
  - you wanted to check the menu?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - what did we say for openers?
  ans:
  - yeah, snails.

- que:
  - every time i come home it's like walking into a strange house.
  ans:
  - did you rearrange this again?

- que:
  - did i tell you to get rid of this?
  ans:
  - it's a harp.

- que:
  - what's it doing in the living room?
  ans:
  - i like the visual sweep.

- que:
  - what's for dinner?
  ans:
  - it's the dinner party.

- que:
  - are you nuts?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna have a snail?.

- que:
  - jesus, what happened to all the turkey meatballs and spaghetti?
  ans:
  - have a potato and truffle thing, that'll hold you.

- que:
  - what's so big about tonight?
  ans:
  - there's a lot of important arts people coming.

- que:
  - is that so terrible?
  ans:
  - but when we talked about making it, we were gonna hit it big, move to florida, swim, eat stone crabs...

- que:
  - you'd come out, remember you'd give it a little of this?
  ans:
  - those days are over.

- que:
  - what good is that if i can't get a cheeseburger?
  ans:
  - ray, please, be charming tonight.

- que:
  - just evian, or perrier?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - have you seen it?
  ans:
  - no, not yet.

- que:
  - ray, why are we standing in the hallway?
  ans:
  - please, let's retire to the living room.

- que:
  - are you a fan of the ballet, mrs winkler?
  ans:
  - i used to be a dancer, but, please, call me fren... frances.

- que:
  - the foxes from saratoga?
  ans:
  - i don't know, i never checked my pedigree.

- que:
  - can we change the music?
  ans:
  - i feel like i should be wearing a wig.

- que:
  - did you do the place yourself?
  ans:
  - they say i have a flair for decorating.

- que:
  - it lights?
  ans:
  - no, it's a visual, honey.

- que:
  - toots?
  ans:
  - shake it, they're in there.

- que:
  - garth...?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you're the outfielder with the padres?
  ans:
  - our goal is to raise $2 million, then the company can tour the west coast and include the new opera.

- que:
  - i do think they overpaid for the picasso.
  ans:
  - he says...

- que:
  - i mean, for me it was unusually mediocre, don't you think?
  ans:
  - i agree completely.

- que:
  - are you affiliated with any of the museums?
  ans:
  - no, i'm a private dealer.

- que:
  - so what are you interested in?
  ans:
  - er, rembrandt, picasso, michelangelo.

- que:
  - but i have come into possession of an incredible damon dexter that someone's trying to sell, is he...?
  ans:
  - i'm not aware of him.

- que:
  - have you rinsed?
  ans:
  - david used to own a vineyard, so he's a tough audience.

- que:
  - this is excruciating.
  ans:
  - in the closet?

- que:
  - and can you believe them?
  ans:
  - i can't keep a straight face.

- que:
  - and the house?
  ans:
  - not to mention her clothes.

- que:
  - what's the matter, honey?
  ans:
  - you've been quiet all night.

- que:
  - what's bothering you?
  ans:
  - what's bothering me is that we got no class.

- que:
  - opera?
  ans:
  - like food and wine and painting and books.

- que:
  - stop it, will you?
  ans:
  - i'm unimpressed.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - to change our lives.

- que:
  - doing what?
  ans:
  - playing pinball?.

- que:
  - yeah, you said you were a teacher, you know art, opera, books, wine, you know, we want to learn it all, don't we, ray?
  ans:
  - i'm flattered you think i'm capable of...

- que:
  - turning two slugs like us into classy items?
  ans:
  - no homework.

- que:
  - what are...
  ans:
  - have you ever thought about enrolling in college?

- que:
  - i'm gonna learn about life suddenly?
  ans:
  - i must say, frenchy, ray has a point, you know.

- que:
  - what's he gonna teach you?
  ans:
  - i can figure the point spread and count cards at blackjack.

- que:
  - you could teach him that, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you said this is a slow period in the art market and we would take ver y good care of you, right?
  ans:
  - like i say, i don't want to discourage you...

- que:
  - you can see the difference between this tintoretto and the earlier byzantine painting we looked at.
  ans:
  - spooked by the virgins!

- que:
  - what would you say is the most significant difference?
  ans:
  - i would say that the frame's bigger here.

- que:
  - you remember how the saints had very flat faces and the background was on the same plane as the foreground?
  ans:
  - perspective.

- que:
  - take a hike, will ya?
  ans:
  - 28.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the band leader, stupid.

- que:
  - oh.
  ans:
  - married to betty grable?

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - this is where he lived and worked and...

- que:
  - the heiress, right?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - did he write that too?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - 500?
  ans:
  - see your five, raise you 500.

- que:
  - what did you think of the book?
  ans:
  - well, i thought it was very romantic.

- que:
  - so you thought it was doomed from the start?
  ans:
  - i guess, cos he wound up dead, but i think that two people from different backgrounds can make it if, er... the juice is there.

- que:
  - sorry, juice is... is?
  ans:
  - you know, the hots.

- que:
  - wine, would you like some wine?
  ans:
  - i brought over a bottle of chateau margaux.

- que:
  - what about indian poker?

  - yeah, um, talking of which, how is your vocabulary coming along?
  ans:
  - oh, good.

- que:
  - they're serious about an art collection?
  ans:
  - no, that would be peanuts.

- que:
  - what, then?
  ans:
  - well, i think that she might be falling for me.

- que:
  - her husband, you mean?
  ans:
  - no, it's all in her name.

- que:
  - i don't know, i suppose i'm saying... people grow and marriages sadly break up and... women remarry, you know?
  ans:
  - fortunes, they change hands.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - it's a damon dexter, a discovery of david's.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - it means i won't look at that wall.

- que:
  - stevens, what time is it?
  ans:
  - i no longer look at this wall.

- que:
  - david, what's this?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - oh, that?
  ans:
  - that's a citrine necklace.

- que:
  - you know about citrines?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and that?
  ans:
  - he did, he did, like our friend henry higgins.

  ans:
  - no...

- que:
  - are you happy being rich?
  ans:
  - it's ok.

- que:
  - how come?
  ans:
  - the guy i was seeing left me because he was so embarrassed about being poor and hated that i paid for everything.

- que:
  - you... you enjoy being rich?
  ans:
  - i hate it.

- que:
  - no, i hate the life, you know?
  ans:
  - it's making me lose frenchy.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i mean she's outgrowing me, that's what she said.

- que:
  - what did you think of it?
  ans:
  - i thought the whole evening was apocalyptic.

- que:
  - apocalyptic?
  ans:
  - totally.

- que:
  - have you been memorising the dictionary?

- que:
  - i i i was married.
  ans:
  - what d'you mean?

- que:
  - a long time ago, right?

  ans:
  - i've, um...

- que:
  - for me?

  ans:
  - now?

- que:
  - what kind of sights?
  ans:
  - churches, opera houses, ruins.

- que:

  ans:
  - well, i wanna go.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - it's part of my development.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're not my type either.

- que:
  - what the hell does that mean?
  ans:
  - maybe frenchy wasn't so wrong to try and make something out of herself.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - wow, what a place.

- que:
  - would it have been on tv?
  ans:

  ans:
  - stupid.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - he was genuinely surprised.

- que:
  - you think it's staged?

  ans:
  - end of the week.

- que:
  - what about the mission director?

- que:
  - are you serious?
  ans:
  - they found him in his office this morning, beaten so badly they had to check his name tag.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - i didn't do it.

- que:
  - besides, what if they do find something?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction.

- que:
  - you've opened the wine, i hope?
  ans:
  - of course, sir.

- que:

  ans:
  - if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

- que:
  - how much do you need?
  ans:
  - 20 minutes.

- que:
  - the eyelash, what do you know about it?
  ans:
  - it's an unregistered in valid.

- que:
  - is a janitor gonna come back here after all this time to kill a man he never knew?
  ans:
  - well, his profile does suggest a violent temperament.

- que:
  - who is he?
  ans:
  - we found an unaccounted for specimen in the south wing.

- que:
  - who do you have to be, to be here?
  ans:
  - naturally, our standard is beyond that of the common citizen.

- que:
  - and exceeding it?
  ans:
  - no one exceeds his potential.

- que:
  - if he did?
  ans:
  - it would mean we did not accurately gauge his potential in the first place.

- que:
  - are you all right, jerome?
  ans:
  - terrific.

- que:
  - do you have an alibi?
  ans:
  - i was alone.

- que:
  - didn't he threaten to cancel your mission more than once?
  ans:
  - somebody did you a favour.

- que:
  - do they have any idea whose hand i should be shaking?
  ans:
  - they found an eyelash in the s wing.

- que:
  - does it have a name?
  ans:
  - just some in valid.

- que:
  - what about you, irene?
  ans:
  - you're engineered just like the rest of us.

- que:
  - is this the approach path we discussed?
  ans:
  - absolutely, director.

- que:
  - they think i killed the mission director.
  ans:
  - why don't you try a change?

- que:
  - what makes them think that?
  ans:
  - they found my eyelash.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - in the corridor.

- que:
  - i've put too much into this.
  ans:
  - what are you doing?

- que:
  - wheel in there and finish the job myself?
  ans:
  - eugene, they are going to find me.

- que:
  - you still don't understand, do you?
  ans:
  - when they look at you, they don't see you any more.

- que:
  - how could you be so careless?
  ans:
  - i'm going out.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - well if i'm gonna get arrested tomorrow, i'm gonna go out tonight.

- que:
  - are you sure that's a good idea to go out?
  ans:
  - that was your idea not to change anything.

- que:
  - who's going?
  ans:
  - i'd say everybody.

- que:
  - you don't want to look suspicious, do you?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - what are we doing here?
  ans:
  - i'm following a lead.

- que:
  - why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here?
  ans:
  - he's an in valid, sir.

- que:
  - what do you suggest, sir?
  ans:
  - move the inquiry back to the scene.

- que:
  - that's what it says, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - it doesn't say you're crippled.

- que:
  - i said forget it.
  ans:
  - how dare you question me?

- que:
  - an apology?
  ans:
  - it gets to you, doesn't it.

- que:
  - what's your number?
  ans:
  - may i remind you that this is a crime scene.

- que:
  - what are you doing, old man?
  ans:
  - doing my job, sir.

- que:
  - you didn't know?
  ans:
  - oh yes, yeah.

- que:
  - wonderful, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - 12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.

- que:
  - what's all this about?
  ans:
  - it's probably nothing.

- que:
  - get my meaning?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - what did i tell you?
  ans:
  - strange.

- que:
  - the cup was definitely used since the original sweep?
  ans:
  - that's far fetched, but is not out of a possibility.

- que:
  - what's with the plungers, lamar?
  ans:
  - only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised.

- que:
  - are you out of practice, lamar?
  ans:
  - let me look at that.

- que:
  - so you didn't do it after all?
  ans:
  - i guess someone beat me to it.

- que:
  - test?
  ans:
  - i cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further.

- que:
  - you're not at all concerned about having amurderer in your midst?
  ans:
  - now, your presence is creating more of a threat.

- que:
  - mission means a great deal to you, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - your late colleague opposed it.

- que:
  - did you get yours broken once?
  ans:
  - i had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me.

- que:
  - would you like to dance?
  ans:
  - check the hands, lenses, dentures, napkins, i want cigarette butts, the saliva off tea cups.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - the scars on your legs?
  ans:
  - this is the exact height of the front fender.

- que:
  - did you just make that up or do you use all the time?
  ans:
  - i use it all the time.

- que:
  - isn't that the man from last night?
  ans:
  - he's nobody.

- que:
  - can i help you?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for jerome morrow.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - eugene, i need you to be yourself for the day.

- que:
  - i was never very good at it, remember?
  ans:
  - the investigators are coming by.

- que:
  - how long have i got?
  ans:
  - not long.

- que:
  - where's my kiss?
  ans:
  - good to see you're feeling better.

- que:
  - how can i help?
  ans:
  - it's about the director.

- que:
  - again?
  ans:
  - i hope it's no trouble.

- que:
  - can't we do this another time?
  ans:
  - this won't take a moment.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - we have our man, sir.

- que:
  - you have him?
  ans:
  - we have him in custody.

- que:
  - how are you, jerome?
  ans:
  - not bad, jerome.

- que:
  - how the hell did you get up here?
  ans:
  - i can always walk.

- que:
  - you're a god child?
  ans:
  - they've got you looking so hard for any flaw, that after a while that's all that you see.

- que:
  - so the in valid had nothing to do with this?
  ans:
  - no, our friend here acted alone.

- que:
  - this mission meant everything to him, didn't it?
  ans:
  - he knows that if they miss this launch window he wouldn't live to see the next one.

- que:
  - so, i imagin you'll be celebrating tonight, sir?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - who, the cop?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you catch his name?
  ans:
  - actually my name was the topic of conversation.

- que:
  - vincent?
  ans:
  - my god, you have changed.

- que:
  - are we brothers?
  ans:
  - our parents both died thinking they'd outlived ya.

- que:
  - what are you doing here, anton?
  ans:
  - i should ask you that question.

- que:
  - do you have any idea what it took to get in here?
  ans:
  - you've gone as far as you can go.

- que:
  - is that the only way you can succeed, is to see me fail?
  ans:
  - in case you haven't noticed, i don't need any rescuing.

- que:
  - you've got all the answers, how do you explain that?
  ans:
  - you didn't beat me that day.

- que:
  - do you want me to prove it to you?
  ans:
  - it's not important, anton.

- que:
  - do you wanna quit?
  ans:
  - we have to go back.

- que:
  - you want to know how i did it?
  ans:
  - this is how i did it, anton.

- que:
  - you couldn't see, could you?
  ans:
  - that night, crossing the street.

- que:
  - you're flying today, aren't you?
  ans:
  - look at what a mess you're in.

- que:
  - why have you done all this?
  ans:
  - so jerome will always be here when you need him.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i'm travelling, too.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - new policy.

- que:
  - flight got you nervous?
  ans:
  - there's a problem, lamar.

- que:
  - i never did tell you about my son, did i?
  ans:
  - he's a big fan of yours.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - for future reference, right handed men don't hold it with their left.

- que:
  - it's next to godliness, isn't that what they say?
  ans:
  - godliness...

- que:
  - has the committee approved the mission?
  ans:
  - there's been talk of delay.

- que:
  - have i ever told you that?
  ans:
  - only every time i'm in here.

- que:
  - by the way, have i ever told you about my son?
  ans:
  - no, you haven't.

- que:
  - a dozen?
  ans:
  - sometimes more.

- que:
  - the name for the certificate?
  ans:
  - anton.

- que:
  - have you given it any thought?
  ans:
  - we would want vincent to have a brother, you know, to play with.

- que:
  - 750 million, 800 million, 850 million.
  ans:
  - see how much he's grown?

- que:
  - how many astronauts are there anyway?
  ans:
  - i bet i could be one if i wanted.

- que:
  - well, i'll take it, allright?
  ans:
  - of course, it's illegal to discriminate.

- que:
  - you're sure you wanna do this?
  ans:
  - you know you're gonna lose.

- que:
  - dreaming of space?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - you might get ideas.

- que:
  - how did you hear about me?
  ans:
  - people.

- que:
  - tattoos, scars, birth marks?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you serious about this?
  ans:
  - i hope you're not wasting my time.

- que:
  - you have somebody in mind?
  ans:
  - for the genetically superior, success is easier to attain, but is by no means not guaranteed.

- que:
  - but how do i explain the accident?
  ans:
  - that's the beautiful thing, it happened out of the country.

- que:
  - who lives up there?
  ans:
  - well, i certainly don't.

- que:
  - isn't there any other way?
  ans:
  - surgery is no good, they'll see the scars.

- que:
  - why, why?
  ans:
  - there's still the matter of the height.

- que:
  - why, how tall are you?
  ans:
  - 4 foot 6.

- que:
  - how tall were you before the accident?
  ans:
  - so, i can wear lifts.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - no...

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you want to go dancing?
  ans:
  - you had to be a right hander.

- que:
  - what makes you think you can be me at all?
  ans:
  - look at this.

- que:
  - are you colour blind, too, vincent?
  ans:
  - i don't know, exactly.

- que:
  - do you really want to be in there?
  ans:
  - i don't wanna be in there, i wanna be up there.

- que:
  - what's up there?
  ans:
  - that's want i want to find out, jerome.

- que:
  - where's my sample?
  ans:
  - in the refrigerator.

- que:
  - which pouch?
  ans:
  - oh, any of them.

- que:
  - you think i should test it?
  ans:
  - if you like.

- que:
  - my god, what's wrong with the machine?
  ans:
  - it's nothing wrong with the machine.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - congratulations.

- que:
  - what about the interview?
  ans:
  - that was it.

- que:
  - excuse me, sir?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - will you seek to that i don't lose my place in line?
  ans:
  - your place is assured.

- que:
  - director?
  ans:
  - thank you, irene.

- que:
  - director, how will this affect the mission?
  ans:
  - oh, we're still going ahead as planned.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i'm going up.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - end of the week.

- que:
  - what about the mission director?
  ans:
  - he's dead.

- que:
  - are you serious?
  ans:
  - they found him in his office this morning, beaten so badly they had to check his name tag.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - i didn't do it.

- que:
  - besides, what if they do find something?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction.

- que:
  - you've opened the wine, i hope?
  ans:
  - of course, sir.

- que:
  - the specimen?
  ans:
  - i kissed him five minutes ago.

- que:
  - you want the full sequence?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - i have my books.

- que:
  - seriously, what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - i'm going to finish this.

- que:
  - what's titan like?
  ans:
  - titan is exactly like this.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - i'm scared of heights.

- que:
  - i'll save some for you, shall l?
  ans:
  - i'm so sorry.

- que:
  - what car?
  ans:
  - i stepped right out in front of it.

- que:
  - i couldn't even get that right, could i?
  ans:
  - if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

- que:
  - how much do you need?
  ans:
  - 20 minutes.

- que:
  - the eyelash, what do you know about it?
  ans:
  - it's an unregistered in valid.

- que:
  - is a janitor gonna come back here after all this time to kill a man he never knew?
  ans:
  - well, his profile does suggest a violent temperament.

- que:
  - who is he?
  ans:
  - we found an unaccounted for specimen in the south wing.

- que:
  - who do you have to be, to be here?
  ans:
  - naturally, our standard is beyond that of the common citizen.

- que:
  - and exceeding it?
  ans:
  - no one exceeds his potential.

- que:
  - if he did?
  ans:
  - it would mean we did not accurately gauge his potential in the first place.

- que:
  - are you all right, jerome?
  ans:
  - terrific.

- que:
  - do you have an alibi?
  ans:
  - i was alone.

- que:
  - didn't he threaten to cancel your mission more than once?
  ans:
  - somebody did you a favour.

- que:
  - do they have any idea whose hand i should be shaking?
  ans:
  - they found an eyelash in the s wing.

- que:
  - does it have a name?
  ans:
  - just some in valid.

- que:
  - what about you, irene?
  ans:
  - you're engineered just like the rest of us.

- que:
  - is this the approach path we discussed?
  ans:
  - absolutely, director.

- que:
  - they think i killed the mission director.
  ans:
  - why don't you try a change?

- que:
  - what makes them think that?
  ans:
  - they found my eyelash.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - in the corridor.

- que:
  - i've put too much into this.
  ans:
  - what are you doing?

- que:
  - wheel in there and finish the job myself?
  ans:
  - eugene, they are going to find me.

- que:
  - you still don't understand, do you?
  ans:
  - when they look at you, they don't see you any more.

- que:
  - how could you be so careless?
  ans:
  - i'm going out.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - well if i'm gonna get arrested tomorrow, i'm gonna go out tonight.

- que:
  - are you sure that's a good idea to go out?
  ans:
  - that was your idea not to change anything.

- que:
  - who's going?
  ans:
  - i'd say everybody.

- que:
  - you don't want to look suspicious, do you?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - what are we doing here?
  ans:
  - i'm following a lead.

- que:
  - why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here?
  ans:
  - he's an in valid, sir.

- que:
  - what do you suggest, sir?
  ans:
  - move the inquiry back to the scene.

- que:
  - that's what it says, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - it doesn't say you're crippled.

- que:
  - i said forget it.
  ans:
  - how dare you question me?

- que:
  - an apology?
  ans:
  - it gets to you, doesn't it.

- que:
  - what's your number?
  ans:
  - may i remind you that this is a crime scene.

- que:
  - what are you doing, old man?
  ans:
  - doing my job, sir.

- que:
  - you didn't know?
  ans:
  - oh yes, yeah.

- que:
  - wonderful, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - 12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.

- que:
  - what's all this about?
  ans:
  - it's probably nothing.

- que:
  - get my meaning?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - what did i tell you?
  ans:
  - strange.

- que:
  - the cup was definitely used since the original sweep?
  ans:
  - two samples, two days.

- que:
  - a borrowed ladder at gattaca?
  ans:
  - that's far fetched, but is not out of a possibility.

- que:
  - what's with the plungers, lamar?
  ans:
  - only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised.

- que:
  - are you out of practice, lamar?
  ans:
  - let me look at that.

- que:
  - so you didn't do it after all?
  ans:
  - i guess someone beat me to it.

- que:
  - test?
  ans:
  - i cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further.

- que:
  - you're not at all concerned about having amurderer in your midst?
  ans:
  - now, your presence is creating more of a threat.

- que:
  - mission means a great deal to you, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - your late colleague opposed it.

- que:
  - did you get yours broken once?
  ans:
  - i had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me.

- que:
  - would you like to dance?
  ans:
  - check the hands, lenses, dentures, napkins, i want cigarette butts, the saliva off tea cups.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - the scars on your legs?
  ans:
  - this is the exact height of the front fender.

- que:
  - did you just make that up or do you use all the time?
  ans:
  - i use it all the time.

- que:
  - isn't that the man from last night?
  ans:
  - he's nobody.

- que:
  - can i help you?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for jerome morrow.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - eugene, i need you to be yourself for the day.

- que:
  - i was never very good at it, remember?
  ans:

- que:
  - where's my kiss?
  ans:
  - good to see you're feeling better.

- que:
  - how can i help?
  ans:
  - it's about the director.

- que:
  - again?
  ans:
  - i hope it's no trouble.

- que:
  - can't we do this another time?
  ans:
  - this won't take a moment.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:

  ans:
  - for future reference, right handed men don't hold it with their left.

- que:
  - so are you happy, mum?
  ans:
  - yes... for you.

- que:
  - jacinto, do you think i might have a word with boaventura now?
  ans:
  - i believe in the free market, that s where i made my fortune.

- que:
  - l ve just received confirmation of the loan to purchase the banco popular.
  ans:
  - are you sure that boaventura will buy the bank?

- que:
  - on our terms?
  ans:
  - on our terms.

- que:
  - may i ask him inside?
  ans:
  - congratulations, mr. boaventura.

- que:
  - i have your word then, mr. boaventura?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what do you want to know?
  ans:
  - the bank of portugal s position in this story.

- que:
  - pedro?

  ans:
  - off the record.

- que:
  - how about a group photo?
  ans:
  - jacinto.

- que:
  - we always have to be the strongest dont we?
  ans:
  - we know no limits, we admit no defeats.

- que:
  - will you be needing anything else?
  ans:
  - no thank you, mr. silva.

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - my government is in favour of the existence of strong economic groups in portugal.

- que:
  - you don t think that you could be placing your political career at risk?
  ans:
  - there are still men of honour in portugal and l m certain that mr. boaventura is one of them.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing...

- que:
  - hi, pedro?
  ans:
  - everything went very well.

- que:
  - why did you leave the university in order to return to portugal?
  ans:
  - because my father s good name is more important to me than my career.

- que:
  - but as a true professional, you also like a good challenge?
  ans:
  - that this is a pyramid and a paper knife... in crystal...

- que:
  - don t take me for an idiot... what does this mean in your secret code?
  ans:
  - you ve got more experience than me in esoteric interpretations.

- que:
  - do our banks have credits on the resende brokerage house?
  ans:
  - l ve left a full report on your desk.

- que:
  - might i ask the reason for your interest?
  ans:
  - my father s brokerage house is in dire straits.

- que:
  - dr. jacinto?
  ans:
  - the minister will see you now.

- que:
  - of course...
  ans:
  - what government?

- que:
  - it appears that your name is being mentioned to occupy a place in the government?
  ans:
  - they re just rumours, mr. boaventura.

- que:
  - dom jos, how are you?
  ans:
  - as has been stated quite clearly in this commission, the government had always acted in the national interest...

- que:
  - dr. jacinto?
  ans:
  - lsabel, please ask dr. teles and dr. alvaro to come to my office.

- que:
  - the only way to climb the pyramid of power is with a dagger.... is that why you came to see me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - l d be delighted.
  ans:
  - rosa, could you come in here please?

- que:
  - which one, francisco?
  ans:
  - you know perfectly well which one.

- que:
  - do you realise what you re suggesting?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - or don t you trust yourself, when i come too close for comfort?
  ans:
  - i prefer to maintain a strict separation between business and pleasure.

- que:
  - a crepe suzette for madame?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - you don t mind?
  ans:
  - don t stand on ceremony with me... in any way...

- que:
  - that would be nice, wouldn t it?
  ans:
  - you re capable of anything, but don t risk a thing.

- que:
  - are you sure this is what you want?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - and you won t regret it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - life is full of surprises, isn t it?
  ans:
  - when we least expect it, something happens and everything s turned on its head.

- que:
  - remember those letters you once wrote to my father?
  ans:
  - you were working in the bank of portugal and transmitted him confidential information on big decisions in the pipeline...

- que:
  - good evening, mr. boaventura?...
  ans:
  - what do you want then?

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - of course i can.

- que:
  - dr. jacinto, didn t you learn in school that all pacts obtained through violence are null and void?
  ans:
  - you pledged to keep the group under national control...

- que:
  - what nation?
  ans:
  - the nation crumbled after the revolution, and respectable citizens were left unprotected.

- que:
  - you re afraid to go your own way.
  ans:
  - where have you been?

- que:
  - what do you know about my life?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - l ll have a word, but he doesn t like to set foot here.

- que:
  - l ve got another excellent proposal to make to you...
  ans:
  - dr. fernando... we re her on business, right?

- que:
  - oh yes?
  ans:
  - mr. boaventura, needs an intelligent person such as maria helena... to oversee his public image and that of his group...

- que:
  - commemorate?
  ans:
  - of course l ll go with you.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - take.. it.. off.. take.. it.. off...

- que:
  - you sure he can be trusted?
  ans:
  - don t worry... he s a college student.

- que:
  - dr. rosa?
  ans:
  - mr. boaventura would like to count upon your influence over dr. jacinto...

- que:
  - could you come to my office please?
  ans:
  - whenever i see you, you never fail to take my breath away.

- que:
  - rosa bought shares in the banco popular?
  ans:
  - so...

- que:
  - what s the big hurry?
  ans:
  - read this confidential document that joaquim castro received from spain.

- que:
  - l m dying to hear the reason for such an urgent visit...
  ans:
  - you think you can defeat these guys on your own?

- que:
  - you ve come to talk about your boys?
  ans:
  - rosa pereira lopes is not the best way to reach jacinto, mr. boaventura... you should have spoken with me first...

- que:
  - at the estate?
  ans:
  - i look forward to it...

- que:
  - i don t know if you re ready for the proposal that l m about to make, and i also don t require an immediate reply...
  ans:
  - mine?

- que:
  - you want to buy our brokerage house?
  ans:
  - no...

- que:
  - lf you had to choose between being loyal to a friend and to an employer, what would you choose, mum?
  ans:
  - i don t think that even father francisco could summarise my situation so succinctly.

- que:
  - who gave you this?
  ans:
  - draw up the contract between boaventura and the santamaria group so as to ensure that our position is unassailable.

- que:
  - true freedom?
  ans:
  - not letting others prevent us doing what we want.

- que:
  - which do you prefer?
  ans:
  - depends who it s for...

- que:
  - you plan to marry?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - don t you want to know the bride s name?
  ans:
  - dr. ftima resende.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - open up.

- que:
  - are you really going to marry boaventura?
  ans:
  - yes...

- que:
  - you never thought of being happy, just happy?
  ans:
  - our happiness resides in being in the centre of big battles.

- que:
  - what do you expect me to do?
  ans:
  - you know better than i do...

- que:
  - minister, is it true that you ve already handed in your resignation?
  ans:
  - minister, where are these agreements?...

- que:
  - some highwayman?
  ans:
  - l ll set the picture straight...

- que:
  - and wasn t he the one who took part in all the negotiations with the government?
  ans:
  - dr. ftima is right:it s important that he assumes boaventura s position in public.

- que:
  - and what if i, and the rest of the board, don t hold this opinion?
  ans:
  - worse for us all... especially for you...

- que:
  - and if i manage to persuade the board to decide in favour of boaventura plc, what do i get out of it, in addition to the photographs?
  ans:
  - mr. boaventura s eternal gratitude... which may materialise in many mysterious and wondrous manners.

- que:
  - dr....?
  ans:
  - dr. jacinto...

- que:
  - ls it true that you ll be joining the government?
  ans:
  - the rdio clube portugus has ascertained that dr. jacinto pereira lopes will be invited for the post of minister of finances.

- que:
  - what do you think i should do:support boaventura or the government?
  ans:
  - let the dust settle and you ll soon recognise who holds the reigns of power.

- que:
  - dr. ftima boaventura has been nominated chairman of the board.
  ans:
  - how did you feel when you learned of this morning s tragedy?

- que:
  - bruce willis is dead.
  ans:
  - what s your reaction to this nomination?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - bruce willis, he's a ghost.

- que:
  - why would you tell me that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  ans:
  - no.

- que:

  ans:
  - she breaks her neck and she dies.

- que:
  - who's russ thompson?
  ans:
  - he's the democrat running for manhattan borough president whose campaign i've been working on.

- que:
  - you guys have to come support russ thompson, all right?
  ans:
  - we cannot let him lose to that republican douche bag jack clark.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - whenever my boss starts dating a new girl, he likes me to show up at the restaurant and pretend to recognize him.

- que:
  - but, i mean, why are you still working for that lunatic?
  ans:
  - because that lunatic is my ticket to rock immortality.

- que:
  - yeah, but what do you expect?
  ans:
  - it was the bachman turner overdrive without bachman or turner.

- que:
  - bobby, you're coming, right?
  ans:
  - no, because i'm not a democrat.

- que:
  - what are you?
  ans:
  - i'm an unregistered.

  - is she hairy?
  ans:
  - i don't have a date with a hairy girl.

- que:
  - because she's... hairless?
  ans:
  - you guys, it's a personal thing.

- que:
  - so what'd you think of thompson?
  ans:
  - i thought he had some really good ideas.

- que:
  - like, those chunks of melon wrapped in ham?
  ans:
  - yeah, that's why i'm voting for him.

- que:
  - hairy or hairless?
  ans:
  - actually, neither.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - so there.

- que:
  - are they sharing a dessert?
  ans:

  ans:
  - he used to design clothes for his g. i. joes.

- que:
  - what do we do now?
  ans:
  - i think we have to tell him that we know.

- que:
  - i mean, why make him go on living a lie?
  ans:
  - i agree.

- que:
  - what stories?
  ans:
  - and i used to get the prickly heat on my legs.

- que:
  - i mean, there's no foreplay, right?
  ans:
  - not that i know.

- que:
  - can i get you a glass of chardonnay?

- que:
  - don't you think you're blowing this a little out of proportion?
  ans:
  - it's just politics.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - and this is why i don't vote.

- que:
  - that if i'm a republican, we can't be friends?
  ans:
  - i don't know.
