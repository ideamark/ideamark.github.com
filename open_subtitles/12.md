- que:
  - I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
  ans:
  - -- Right after I sprayed her?

- que:
  - Hey, what's happening? Mary! Telephone. What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Wanda...

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.

- que:
  - What with?
  ans:
  - -- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.

- que:
  - -- White ladies?
  ans:
  - -- Oh my yes.

- que:
  - I don't know if you don't know --
  ans:
  - Otis is dead.

- que:
  - -- Otis?
  ans:
  - -- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...

- que:
  - -- why did you come in today?
  ans:
  - -- left my bag, didn't have no money...

- que:
  - -- how did you get here?
  ans:
  - -- took a bus.

- que:
  - Hey, baby, what's happening?
  ans:
  - Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.

- que:
  - What're you talking about?
  ans:
  - Gunshots, there were some gunshots.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Here in the canyon.

- que:
  - What's gonna happen?
  ans:
  - I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.

- que:
  - Well, like what?
  ans:
  - I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...

- que:
  - You said somebody... who?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.

- que:
  - No shit?
  ans:
  - Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.

- que:
  - Honey, what happened?
  ans:
  - I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - You're different.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - You're great.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Do you really mean that?
  ans:
  - Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.

- que:
  - Honey?
  ans:
  - Yeah, baby.

- que:
  - Will we live together?
  ans:
  - We live together now.

- que:
  - I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - George.
  ans:
  - George?

- que:
  - Hey, baby, what's happening?
  ans:
  - They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.

- que:
  - How did it go at the bank?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Could I?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Great... can we talk later?
  ans:
  - George.

- que:
  - When can I talk to you?
  ans:
  - Baby, I'm in the middle of work.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Whether or not I'm going.

- que:
  - Going where?
  ans:
  - Egypt.

- que:
  - Honey, have they offered you the job?
  ans:
  - No, but I think they might.

- que:
  - I want your feelings about it.
  ans:
  - What do you want?

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - When I get off work.

- que:
  - When is that?
  ans:
  - I'll call you.

- que:
  - When is that, George?
  ans:
  - I'll call you.

- que:
  - Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
  ans:
  - ... Okay...

- que:
  - Where's your car?
  ans:
  - A friend dropped me off.

- que:
  - Never mind. Where've you been?
  ans:
  - A business meeting, I told you that.

- que:
  - What business meeting?
  ans:
  - Look at the way I live.

- que:
  - I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
  ans:
  - What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.

- que:
  - What does he direct besides traffic?
  ans:
  - Ha, ha.

- que:
  - Television or movies?
  ans:
  - Commercials.

- que:
  - How come you took your own car?
  ans:
  - I didn't want him meeting me here.

- que:
  - You did fuck him, didn't you?
  ans:
  - I'm very tired, George.

- que:
  - Didn't you, baby?
  ans:
  - Let go of me.

- que:
  - Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
  ans:
  - I'd like you to leave now.

- que:
  - Where did this come from?
  ans:
  - Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.

- que:
  - So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
  ans:
  - Baby, don't do this. I do love you.

- que:
  - Obviously there were others, weren't there?
  ans:
  - Obviously.

- que:
  - What do you wanna know for?
  ans:
  - I just want to know, that's all.

- que:
  - What difference does it make?
  ans:
  - I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.

- que:
  - What? What? What? What? What?
  ans:
  - ... honest. At least you're honest with me.

- que:
  - Does it make you happy?
  ans:
  - I wish you'd go now.

- que:
  - That's all you've got to say?
  ans:
  - -- yes.

- que:
  - -- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
  ans:
  - George...

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - Please!... that's not like you.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know. Did you?
  ans:
  - George, now cut this out.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - Stop it.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes, I did.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - George...

- que:
  - What're you here for?
  ans:
  - -- A wash and set.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - You need a cut.

- que:
  - I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - I'm better than the guy I work for.

- que:
  - After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
  ans:
  - It's good you want to do something, George.

- que:
  - They're not?
  ans:
  - You're right.

- que:
  - George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Tonight?
  ans:
  - -- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - -- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.

- que:
  - What about, tonight?
  ans:
  - See she doesn't drink too much.

- que:
  - Isn't that bad for it?
  ans:
  - This really ought to be layered...

- que:
  - You live like a pig.
  ans:
  - Layered?

- que:
  - Yeah. How long have you been here?
  ans:
  - All night.

- que:
  - Well... who are those guys?
  ans:
  - What do they look like?...

- que:
  - Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.

- que:
  - Well, what?
  ans:
  - Godammit, George...

- que:
  - I wanna hear it from you!
  ans:
  - ... yes, I follow your thinking on that.

- que:
  - Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't know.

- que:
  - Want a drink?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
  ans:
  - Who?

- que:
  - I mean, how did that happen?
  ans:
  - Lester, it just happened.

- que:
  - You really think so?
  ans:
  - Yes I do.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.

- que:
  - What took you so long?
  ans:
  - Wasn't sure it was you.

- que:
  - All right, who're you with? Jill?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now... I'm not kidding.

- que:
  - A soap?
  ans:
  - A daytime soap opera.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I was too old.

- que:
  - What was it, somebody's daughter?
  ans:
  - Somebody's mother.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.

- que:
  - No kidding? Your own shop?
  ans:
  - I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.

- que:
  - Who do you think I was talking to?
  ans:
  - My secretary saw you with that boy.

- que:
  - Steve?
  ans:
  - Whatever his name is, that actor.

- que:
  - Really? How about starting with tonight?
  ans:
  - You and your touchy investors.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You're still jealous.

- que:
  - Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Aren't you going to have one?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I don't want one.

- que:
  - Who are they?
  ans:
  - Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.

- que:
  - Does she know about us?
  ans:
  - Jesus, she's my best friend.

- que:
  - Hi, doll, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - You know what's wrong.

- que:
  - I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
  ans:
  - Poster-Kleiser.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Who is that?
  ans:
  - A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.

- que:
  - I am? I mean why?
  ans:
  - Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.

- que:
  - So what's your point?
  ans:
  - Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.

- que:
  - Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind?
  ans:
  - Don't be silly.

- que:
  - You're really a love -- you sure?
  ans:
  - -- No. No really.

- que:
  - Well, what is it, honey?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
  ans:
  - We don't think marriage is important.

- que:
  - But you have problems?
  ans:
  - -- Yeah, honey...

- que:
  - Five times a day?
  ans:
  - -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.

- que:
  - Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
  ans:
  - Well, you know what I mean.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.

- que:
  - He does?
  ans:
  - Well yes -- you know that about George.

- que:
  - Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
  ans:
  - I would say so, yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.

- que:
  - -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
  ans:
  - -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...

- que:
  - Didn't you have any panties on?
  ans:
  - -- He reached up and tore them.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.

- que:
  - No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
  ans:
  - No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.

- que:
  - Egypt?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - But why Egypt?
  ans:
  - Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.

- que:
  - Why don't you ask for another one?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.

- que:
  - Is he an enemy?
  ans:
  - Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.

- que:
  - -- sort of a boyfriend?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - What does he do? Is he an actor?
  ans:
  - -- no.

- que:
  - Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
  ans:
  - Not with your hairdresser.

- que:
  - This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
  ans:
  - Well... sure...

- que:
  - George? Was he alone?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Well did he go in there with Jackie?
  ans:
  - That bastard.

- que:
  - Let's do that.
  ans:
  - George is a hairdresser, isn't he?

- que:
  - -- why?
  ans:
  - -- these bastards have me hemmed in.

- que:
  - Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - You mean when are you going to Egypt?
  ans:
  - Now I didn't mean that, you rat.

- que:
  - You're going?
  ans:
  - You're going.

- que:
  - Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?
  ans:
  - -- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - We can't really leave that poor man here alone.

- que:
  - -- what's the problem, honey?
  ans:
  - -- his car. They have it blocked.

- que:
  - Oh that's no problem. -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
  ans:
  - Jill.

- que:
  - No... how long did you say?
  ans:
  - Three weeks.

- que:
  - Do you have children?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you married?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you have something against traveling?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Have they sat down?
  ans:
  - Everybody but us.

- que:
  - Everything okay, son?
  ans:
  - Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.

- que:
  - Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
  ans:
  - Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm hungry.

- que:
  - You mean they ate each other up?
  ans:
  - They had to, in order to survive.

- que:
  - Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
  ans:
  - Come here for a minute, first.

- que:
  - How's it going, Doc?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Are you having a good time?
  ans:
  - Yes, Dad.

- que:
  - I am, Dad. Dad?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you feel bad?
  ans:
  - No. I'm just a little tired.

- que:
  - Then why don't you go to sleep?
  ans:
  - I can't. I have too much to do.

- que:
  - Yes I do. I love it. Don't you?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
  ans:
  - No, Dad.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yes, Dad.

- que:
  - You don't? Well what's your favorite food then?
  ans:
  - French Fries and Ketchup.

- que:
  - Do you like ice cream, Doc?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why don't you want to talk about it?
  ans:
  - I'm not supposed to.

- que:
  - Who says you ain't supposed to?
  ans:
  - Tony.

- que:
  - Who's Tony?
  ans:
  - Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.

- que:
  - Is Tony the one that tells you things?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How does he tell you things?
  ans:
  - It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.

- que:
  - Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do they know he tell you things?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Is there something bad here?
  ans:
  - Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.

- que:
  - You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
  ans:
  - No I ain't.

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?

- que:
  - Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
  ans:
  - Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.

- que:
  - We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, Mom.

- que:
  - Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
  ans:
  - Jack...

- que:
  - The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - And you're gonna lose. And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?

- que:
  - I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
  ans:
  - Not right now, Daddy's asleep.

- que:
  - Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can't you wait till later?
  ans:
  - I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.

- que:
  - Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, Mom.

- que:
  - Danny?
  ans:
  - Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum.

- que:
  - Danny... what's the matter, hon?
  ans:
  - Red Rum.

- que:
  - Oh!
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
  ans:
  - Talking to Tony.

- que:
  - Is Tony one of your animals?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because he hides.

- que:
  - Where does he go?
  ans:
  - To my stomach.

- que:
  - Do I have to?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'd like you to.

- que:
  - Shall we go into the living room?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
  ans:
  - Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.

- que:
  - Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
  ans:
  - Tony.

- que:
  - Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
  ans:
  - No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.

- que:
  - What sort of injury did he have?
  ans:
  - Ah he dislocated his shoulder.

- que:
  - How did he manage to do that?
  ans:
  - Oh I wouldn't think of it.

- que:
  - Well how can I repay you?
  ans:
  - It's okay, really.

- que:
  - Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Advocaat is it?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...

- que:
  - Grady?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - haven't I seen you somewhere before?
  ans:
  - Why no, sir. I don't believe so.

- que:
  - Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
  ans:
  - Why no, sir. I don't believe so.

- que:
  - And, er... where are they now?
  ans:
  - Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - A nigger.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Well, he is a very willful boy.

- que:
  - You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
  ans:
  - Good evening. Forest Service.

- que:
  - I'd be glad to do that, sir. Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
  ans:
  - Thank you very much. I'll do that.

- que:
  - Oh, that's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far?
  ans:
  - It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance.

- que:
  - Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
  ans:
  - I'm a Wendy.

- que:
  - Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.

- que:
  - Beg pardon?
  ans:
  - Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.

- que:
  - Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
  ans:
  - Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.

- que:
  - Bill, how do you do?
  ans:
  - Pleased to meet you.

- que:
  - What line of work are you in now?
  ans:
  - I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.

- que:
  - How's my credit in this joint anyway?
  ans:
  - Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

- que:
  - How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
  ans:
  - Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.

- que:
  - No charge?
  ans:
  - Your money's no good here.

- que:
  - Hi, hon. How's it going?
  ans:
  - Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.

- que:
  - God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
  ans:
  - Perfect for a child.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - It's about eleven thirty.

- que:
  - It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
  ans:
  - Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.

- que:
  - Any ideas yet?
  ans:
  - Lots of ideas. No good ones.

- que:
  - It's really nice up here, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do about it?
  ans:
  - Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy.

- que:
  - and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
  ans:
  - I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had. It's the most horrible dream I ever had.

- que:
  - Did you find anything?
  ans:
  - No, nothing at all.

- que:
  - You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did.

- que:
  - Absolutely nothing. How is he?
  ans:
  - He's still asleep.

- que:
  - Get him out of here?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You mean just leave the hotel?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
  ans:
  - I...

- que:
  - You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
  ans:
  - As soon as possible.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I just want to go back to my room.

- que:
  - Wendy...
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm Jack Torrance.

- que:
  - Have any trouble finding us?
  ans:
  - Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours.

- que:
  - JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
  ans:
  - Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

- que:
  - How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?
  ans:
  - They'll love it.

- que:
  - I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
  ans:
  - I don't believe they did.

- que:
  - Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around?
  ans:
  - No, my son's discovered the games room.

- que:
  - Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
  ans:
  - Right there.

- que:
  - Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
  ans:
  - Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

- que:
  - Royalty?
  ans:
  - All the best people.

- que:
  - Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - How're you getting on?
  ans:
  - It's amazing how much activity is going on today.

- que:
  - Just like a ghost ship, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How do you do?
  ans:
  - Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.

- que:
  - Lowe's car-?
  ans:
  - Blue. This blue.

- que:
  - Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.

- que:
  - Can I tell you kids something?
  ans:
  - Sure, Uncle Al.

- que:
  - A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
  ans:
  - I don't want your money. You're a booger.

- que:
  - Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
  ans:
  - Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?

- que:
  - Went shopping. Why?
  ans:
  - Jane, I have to talk to you.

- que:
  - Will you marry me, Jane?
  ans:
  - Please, Uncle Al.

- que:
  - Are you all right, Marty?
  ans:
  - All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

- que:
  - You're a real booger, you know it?
  ans:
  - You booger.

- que:
  - For getting a divorce?
  ans:
  - Well... it is his third.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've been hearing noises in there.

- que:
  - What kind of noises?
  ans:
  - Rattling. Rustling.

- que:
  - Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
  ans:
  - Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?

- que:
  - You all right, Marty?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
  ans:
  - It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.

- que:
  - Your mom's not around, is she?
  ans:
  - She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.

- que:
  - Do I need one?
  ans:
  - We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.

- que:
  - I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Yeah! What is it?
  ans:
  - Yeah... sure.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - A tracer. You'll like it.

- que:
  - What the hell does that matter?
  ans:
  - No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.

- que:
  - Marty, do you see your suspect?
  ans:
  - I told you!

- que:
  - What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
  ans:
  - I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.

- que:
  - You're not going to let it go, are you?
  ans:
  - I saw what I saw.

- que:
  - Yeah? Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.

- que:
  - What if I say no?
  ans:
  - Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - What about crack? You a user?
  ans:
  - I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

- que:
  - Yes, Mary?
  ans:
  - We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.

- que:
  - How come? Sister?
  ans:
  - Well... because it's in the Bible. \"Thou shalt not...\" Thou shalt not.

- que:
  - Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
  ans:
  - Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.

- que:
  - And you listen to that?
  ans:
  - No, but... I don't know... sometimes.

- que:
  - What you do?
  ans:
  - Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.

- que:
  - Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
  ans:
  - You know it.

- que:
  - His ashes?
  ans:
  - With love.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You can handle this.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off.

- que:
  - What did who say?
  ans:
  - Who? The other woman. Your wife.

- que:
  - How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
  ans:
  - Today was the deadline, Vince.

- que:
  - You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy?
  ans:
  - He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity.

- que:
  - You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?
  ans:
  - No... it's fine.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Thanks. A lot.

- que:
  - Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Yes, Betty?
  ans:
  - Look at that. Get a gander.

- que:
  - Yes, Betty?
  ans:
  - HE'S SO FINE.

- que:
  - Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes?
  ans:
  - Not in years.

- que:
  - But don't you get money? From the Vatican?
  ans:
  - Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.

- que:
  - Is this... choir practice?
  ans:
  - Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.

- que:
  - Chops?
  ans:
  - Two days. An hour or so.

- que:
  - We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
  ans:
  - Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?

- que:
  - Were you wicked?
  ans:
  - Enough jabber.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.

- que:
  - Like this place?
  ans:
  - Shirelles.

- que:
  - Soprano or alto?
  ans:
  - Whatever.

- que:
  - Mary Clarence, are you with us?
  ans:
  - Um, I don't really know this one...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.

- que:
  - I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.

- que:
  - Is there any syrup?
  ans:
  - We could cut a demo. Look for a label.

- que:
  - Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
  ans:
  - You re okay -- for a civilian.

- que:
  - What? What time is it?
  ans:
  - It's after five. We have to bathe.

- que:
  - What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share?
  ans:
  - I... I...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I... I brought you something.

- que:
  - A cigarette?
  ans:
  - An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard.

- que:
  - Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?
  ans:
  - Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.

- que:
  - So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
  ans:
  - Three years. Sister.

- que:
  - You have to help me
  ans:
  - Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?

- que:
  - She said that? Reverend Mother?
  ans:
  - Well, then there's only one thing to do.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.

- que:
  - Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
  ans:
  - We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.

- que:
  - Experience! Right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Who are all these people?
  ans:
  - I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.

- que:
  - Are you leaving us?
  ans:
  - Oh no. We'll always be together.

- que:
  - Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
  ans:
  - Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's.

- que:
  - The reason?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Miss Van Cartier.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your cigarette -- out.

- que:
  - Are you talking about me?
  ans:
  - And all those like you.

- que:
  - You mean black people?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.

- que:
  - What's a concubine?
  ans:
  - Check your driver's license.

- que:
  - Would you like that?
  ans:
  - Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.

- que:
  - Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb guy?
  ans:
  - No problem.

- que:
  - Like to who?
  ans:
  - And the vow of chastity.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.

- que:
  - Silence? No talking? All day?
  ans:
  - Until sundown.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.

- que:
  - No food?
  ans:
  - No food. Not until sundown.

- que:
  - Is this all the food I get?
  ans:
  - Yes. Until breakfast.

- que:
  - That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines?
  ans:
  - This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.

- que:
  - My what?
  ans:
  - Your cell. Your room.

- que:
  - You were right the first time. Is this like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the furniture?
  ans:
  - Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.

- que:
  - Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?
  ans:
  - Useless distractions.

- que:
  - Oh, I don't know... Satan?
  ans:
  - Your cell is more than adequate.

- que:
  - Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery?
  ans:
  - It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.

- que:
  - What's wrong with my life?
  ans:
  - From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - It never solves anything.

- que:
  - A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor?
  ans:
  - Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.

- que:
  - Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
  ans:
  - I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.

- que:
  - A vote?
  ans:
  - But... wait a minute...

- que:
  - You sent for me?
  ans:
  - You have a phone call.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.

- que:
  - But -- why?
  ans:
  - I must go where I can be of use.

- que:
  - Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
  ans:
  - What are you doing here?

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - You saved my life.

- que:
  - I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
  ans:
  - You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.

- que:
  - Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
  ans:
  - Don't push it.

- que:
  - Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
  ans:
  - So I don't shop.

- que:
  - When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant? What do you want -- cheap thrills?
  ans:
  - Then-you run.

- que:
  - Ten flights?
  ans:
  - You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.

- que:
  - What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

- que:
  - Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
  ans:
  - Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.

- que:
  - I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
  ans:
  - Pray.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.

- que:
  - What'd she say?
  ans:
  - You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.

- que:
  - Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
  ans:
  - She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.

- que:
  - So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
  ans:
  - It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..

- que:
  - Really? Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - I've been worried about you.

- que:
  - You mean -- worried about my testimony?
  ans:
  - No -- worried about you. Personally.

- que:
  - You're not... seeing anybody?
  ans:
  - No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed.

- que:
  - I have?
  ans:
  - You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different...

- que:
  - Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
  ans:
  - I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try.

- que:
  - I can't go with you.
  ans:
  - How?

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - Even nuns have to pee.

- que:
  - Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
  ans:
  - I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.

- que:
  - Yeah, like what?
  ans:
  - Hey, girls.

- que:
  - You won't even tell us?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't even tell the Pope.

- que:
  - Who are you guys?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - And if she runs?
  ans:
  - Take care of it.

- que:
  - It's done?
  ans:
  - Not... totally.

- que:
  - But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
  ans:
  - It didn't happen.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - It didn't work, Vince.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Yeah, right -- when I see it.

- que:
  - For like, twelve zillion eternities?
  ans:
  - A sweater.

- que:
  - What's she doing?
  ans:
  - She's praying.

- que:
  - Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
  ans:
  - Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.

- que:
  - She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
  ans:
  - Sister Mary Patrick?

- que:
  - But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
  ans:
  - She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.

- que:
  - Which convent was that, Sister?
  ans:
  - Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.

- que:
  - Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
  ans:
  - Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.

- que:
  - We can't sing without her! What should we do?
  ans:
  - We'll pray -- and she'll be there.

- que:
  - You mean -- they kidnapped her?
  ans:
  - Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

- que:
  - Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
  ans:
  - A Benedictine.

- que:
  - I don't understand. Where is she?
  ans:
  - Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.

- que:
  - Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
  ans:
  - She said they were from her old convent.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.

- que:
  - Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
  ans:
  - It's that call you were expecting, Vince.

- que:
  - Can you hold? Can you try?
  ans:
  - She's a nun, Vince.

- que:
  - If we could speak alone.
  ans:
  - Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?

- que:
  - Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
  ans:
  - Many have.

- que:
  - Who took the meat?
  ans:
  - Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.

- que:
  - Hail, Constable. How are you?
  ans:
  - Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased.

- que:
  - Um... I... I did not... no. Why?
  ans:
  - Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting. This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.

- que:
  - How did you hear this?
  ans:
  - Certainly not.

- que:
  - You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
  ans:
  - Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.

- que:
  - Two days... ? For murder?
  ans:
  - Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.

- que:
  - I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
  ans:
  - I was afraid of this.

- que:
  - Why did you move the body, Doctor?
  ans:
  - To place it inside its coffin.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....

- que:
  - What are you spying on?
  ans:
  - The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.

- que:
  - You will stay at her side?
  ans:
  - ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.

- que:
  - What of it?
  ans:
  - No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - When this cut was made, this person was already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel.

- que:
  - Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
  ans:
  - All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...

- que:
  - Does that look like an animal hanging?
  ans:
  - No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what you say.

- que:
  - Do you have these persons' wills?
  ans:
  - I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.

- que:
  - May we look at them now?
  ans:
  - Of course. You want them... it shall not take long. Wait here.

- que:
  - Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
  ans:
  - Well... that might be... helpful.

- que:
  - Have they nothing to fear presently?
  ans:
  - Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow. As do our courts.

- que:
  - But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
  ans:
  - Very few, if any.

- que:
  - Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
  ans:
  - For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.

- que:
  - Chosen me?
  ans:
  - These \"methods\" of yours... there has been no practical application.

- que:
  - Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath?
  ans:
  - Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him. They have children and a good home and good land.

- que:
  - The militia?
  ans:
  - The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was next...

- que:
  - Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
  ans:
  - He would not have gone into the Western Woods. No sane man would.

- que:
  - What is that you wear?
  ans:
  - My talisman. It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it is worthless.

- que:
  - Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
  ans:
  - We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.

- que:
  - What is the common thread between these victims?
  ans:
  - I'm sure I don't know.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Up.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.

- que:
  - Out there. What do you see?
  ans:
  - The Western Woods.

- que:
  - What kind of nuts?
  ans:
  - Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Listen.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by.

- que:
  - How could something named \"the tree of the dead\" fail to draw attention?
  ans:
  - We should not go much further in this murk.

- que:
  - Should we go back?
  ans:
  - We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.

- que:
  - What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
  ans:
  - If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it look that way.

- que:
  - Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why?
  ans:
  - Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Stay back.

- que:
  - Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ?
  ans:
  - We should go.

- que:
  - Why this tree?
  ans:
  - Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.

- que:
  - Man or woman?
  ans:
  - All I saw was their lantern.

- que:
  - What good is this?
  ans:
  - To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.

- que:
  - But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
  ans:
  - No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate.

- que:
  - In test... what?
  ans:
  - Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.

- que:
  - What does it mean?
  ans:
  - Baltus Van Tassel.

- que:
  - Did your father take a loan?
  ans:
  - Lady Van Tassel.

- que:
  - Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
  ans:
  - No. They are all missing.

- que:
  - What books?
  ans:
  - Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.

- que:
  - She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?
  ans:
  - I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.

- que:
  - Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
  ans:
  - Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here.

- que:
  - Why... why are you like this?
  ans:
  - You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand.

- que:
  - What can we do?
  ans:
  - Take the reins.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - I doubt that's the end.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Tired.

- que:
  - You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have.

- que:
  - Other people?
  ans:
  - Small talk.

- que:
  - Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
  ans:
  - Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.

- que:
  - My suitor?
  ans:
  - The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call \"friend,\" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

- que:
  - Are you so superstitious?
  ans:
  - To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.

- que:
  - Really? Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
  ans:
  - Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.

- que:
  - May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
  ans:
  - You pay great attention to small things. I hide these as I hide all my books. Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.

- que:
  - These scars. How did you get them?
  ans:
  - I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.

- que:
  - Yes, he does. May I try?
  ans:
  - He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being...

- que:
  - You made this, and the drawings?
  ans:
  - Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy magic.

- que:
  - Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at least?
  ans:
  - If you want. But...

- que:
  - If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
  ans:
  - People have put their trust in you.

- que:
  - Why would you do such a thing?
  ans:
  - No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh...

- que:
  - What are you on about?
  ans:
  - The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.

- que:
  - And this gives worth to butchery?
  ans:
  - It was not butchery.

- que:
  - What is it then? Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
  ans:
  - I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.

- que:
  - What troubles you?
  ans:
  - The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.

- que:
  - What has happened?
  ans:
  - Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she? She bears so little resemblance.

- que:
  - She died. Her lungs were diseased... two years ago. What is this about?
  ans:
  - Memories have come back. I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. Lord, how I hate this place.

- que:
  - If you want me to go, I will. Do you want me to leave?
  ans:
  - I... I do not know. I no longer know what I think or what I feel.

- que:
  - Katrina. Why do you follow?
  ans:
  - I apologize if I worried you.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just... keep where you are.

- que:
  - My God... what has happened?
  ans:
  - He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.

- que:
  - Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
  ans:
  - The skull is gone.

- que:
  - What... what are you doing... ?
  ans:
  - I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

- que:
  - What is so urgent?
  ans:
  - Come with me.

- que:
  - And, what did he say?
  ans:
  - He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...

- que:
  - What did he say, Katrina?
  ans:
  - I have not been able to face him yet.

- que:
  - What would you have me believe?
  ans:
  - If you think I am behind this, say it.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - I do not know. Away.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - His horse.

- que:
  - TASSEL You said yourself. What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
  ans:
  - It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.

- que:
  - TASSEL Returning to the Western Woods?
  ans:
  - Yes, actually.

- que:
  - TASSEL She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
  ans:
  - Very little. I must be going...

- que:
  - TASSEL Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?
  ans:
  - It is fine. Now, I must...

- que:
  - What... ?
  ans:
  - TASSEL You cannot kill what is already dead.

- que:
  - Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay?
  ans:
  - I can show exactly.

- que:
  - There was not much blood, was there?
  ans:
  - Yes. Here...

- que:
  - You are from the Hollow?
  ans:
  - In a way, yes.

- que:
  - Can you help?
  ans:
  - You want to see into the nether world... I can show you. Whatever you see, do not move or speak. I will hold him.

- que:
  - What... what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Close your mouth! Keep silent.

- que:
  - TASSEL Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
  ans:
  - TASSEL He rides tonight.

- que:
  - May I see my mother?
  ans:
  - You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.

- que:
  - Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
  ans:
  - I can't remember.

- que:
  - You got any money?
  ans:
  - They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.

- que:
  - All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
  ans:
  - I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.

- que:
  - Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
  ans:
  - I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.

- que:
  - He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
  ans:
  - Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.

- que:
  - Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
  ans:
  - Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.

- que:
  - Can I see him?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.

- que:
  - You have any biscuits for sale?
  ans:
  - Naw, we don't have biscuits.

- que:
  - What you got that's good to eat?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess it's all good.

- que:
  - What do you like to eat here?
  ans:
  - French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.

- que:
  - What you got in there, warshing?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
  ans:
  - I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead. He got hit by a train.

- que:
  - How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
  ans:
  - About a half a mile I think it is.

- que:
  - My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Karl's my name.

- que:
  - Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
  ans:
  - You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.

- que:
  - I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
  ans:
  - He's just mentally retarded, I guess.

- que:
  - Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
  ans:
  - You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.

- que:
  - You know what we ought to do tonight?
  ans:
  - Please Doyle, don't.

- que:
  - What do you want, hun?
  ans:
  - We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.

- que:
  - How'd your baptizin' go?
  ans:
  - It went real good.

- que:
  - All right, y'all gonna go with me?
  ans:
  - Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.

- que:
  - Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I?
  ans:
  - No sir.

- que:
  - That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
  ans:
  - Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --

- que:
  - You like that Vaughan?
  ans:
  - Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.

- que:
  - You enjoying yourself, Karl?
  ans:
  - I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.

- que:
  - I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
  ans:
  - This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.

- que:
  - What's all them books?
  ans:
  - Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.

- que:
  - You believe in the Bible?
  ans:
  - A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.

- que:
  - How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
  ans:
  - Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.

- que:
  - What numbers do you punch?
  ans:
  - I aim to kill you with it.

- que:
  - What's you last name?
  ans:
  - Childers.

- que:
  - What are all them books?
  ans:
  - Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.

- que:
  - Don't you live somewhere?
  ans:
  - I did live there in the state hospital.

- que:
  - They let you out?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.

- que:
  - Are you well?
  ans:
  - I reckon I feel all right.

- que:
  - Do you like to play football?
  ans:
  - I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.

- que:
  - Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
  ans:
  - Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.

- que:
  - Yeah. What you doin' by here?
  ans:
  - You told me to come by.

- que:
  - Did you want to play ball with us?
  ans:
  - I ain't no good at it. I just come by.

- que:
  - I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
  ans:
  - They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.

- que:

  ans:
  - My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.

- que:

  ans:
  - Karl. You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.

- que:
  - Who did you kill?
  ans:
  - Two people.

- que:
  - Were they bad people?
  ans:
  - I thought they was.

- que:
  - It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
  ans:
  - I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.

- que:
  - Will you stay here with us for a long time?
  ans:
  - I reckon if you want me to. I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.

- que:
  - Hey Karl, you off work?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where'd you get them flowers?
  ans:
  - That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.

  ans:

- que:
  - You want to go with me?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

  ans:
  - Yes sir. You ort not know that language.

- que:
  - And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny. You know why I want you to play ball with me?
  ans:
  - Naw.

- que:
  - Why not? It died?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It was alive?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. Right then it was.

- que:
  - A boy or girl?
  ans:
  - A little ol' boy.

- que:
  - It was still alive when you buried it?
  ans:
  - I heared it cryin' a little through that box.

- que:
  - She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
  ans:
  - I reckon.

- que:
  - What you readin'?
  ans:
  - I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.

- que:
  - You will? For sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - We'll be on teams, me and you?
  ans:
  - Yessir.

- que:
  - It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
  ans:
  - No sir.

- que:
  - Can we play ever' Saturday?
  ans:
  - If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out. I'm proud of ye.

- que:
  - I knowed you'd be here. What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
  ans:
  - I'm glad of it you was borned. I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.

- que:
  - Man. Thanks. You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
  ans:
  - You know I would. Whatever you want.

- que:
  - Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.

- que:
  - Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
  ans:
  - Nice to meet you, Karl.

- que:
  - Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
  ans:
  - Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.

- que:
  - How come Karl won't eat here with us?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.

- que:
  - You all right, Mama?
  ans:
  - I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.

- que:
  - No, honey, we don't. I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
  ans:
  - What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.

- que:
  - Did Vaughan go home?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.

- que:
  - Did Karl go to bed?
  ans:
  - I bet he don't. Karl likes me.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.

- que:
  - Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
  ans:
  - I love you, too, Mama.

- que:
  - You walk fast, don't you?
  ans:
  - I reckon.

- que:
  - These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
  ans:
  - I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.

- que:
  - Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I want to come back and stay here.

- que:
  - Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
  ans:
  - Naw.

- que:
  - I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
  ans:
  - I reckon.

- que:
  - Karl, you up?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Do they know about you?
  ans:
  - My history.

- que:
  - Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
  ans:
  - Tolerable, I reckon.

- que:
  - Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
  ans:
  - No ma'am.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.

- que:
  - Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up. They say you're well?
  ans:
  - Yes ma'am. I like your garage. I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.

- que:
  - Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
  ans:
  - No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.

- que:
  - Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
  ans:
  - He wanted to go off and play, I reckon. You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.

- que:
  - Ma'am?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
  ans:
  - I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.

- que:
  - Why are you here now?
  ans:
  - They turned me loose from the state hospital.

- que:
  - Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long?
  ans:
  - I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.

- que:
  - Do you have family here?
  ans:
  - Not really to speak of.

- que:
  - So, you're really going to stay here?
  ans:
  - That boy wants me to.

- que:
  - Did you knock on the door yet?
  ans:
  - Naw, I ain't.

- que:
  - How long have you been standing here?
  ans:
  - Quite a spell, I reckon.

- que:
  - Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
  ans:
  - I done et just a little bit ago.

- que:
  - Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
  ans:
  - I've heard it said that way.

- que:
  - Oh. How about before that?
  ans:
  - Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.

- que:
  - Can I help you, sir?
  ans:
  - He just got out of the state hospital.

- que:
  - Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
  ans:
  - Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.

- que:
  - Karl is a guy guy?
  ans:
  - Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.

- que:
  - Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
  ans:
  - Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.

- que:
  - Do you smell shit?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why won't he talk to women?
  ans:
  - My name's Jerry Woolridge.

- que:
  - Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - That's really strange. What does it mean?
  ans:
  - One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.

- que:
  - How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
  ans:
  - It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Signs?
  ans:
  - Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.

- que:
  - Is he leaving right this minute?
  ans:
  - We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.

- que:
  - Where will he go?
  ans:
  - Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.

- que:
  - Will he be supervised?
  ans:
  - As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.

- que:
  - You mean about y'all bein' together in \"that\" way?
  ans:
  - It's my birthday.

- que:
  - And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
  ans:
  - Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--

- que:
  - And what are you, his chaperone?
  ans:
  - Actually, I'm his father.

- que:
  - Will that be cash or charge?
  ans:
  - Better make it charge.

- que:
  - I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I confess.

- que:
  - So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
  ans:
  - Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.

- que:
  - And your father? Is he from New York?
  ans:
  - Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.

- que:
  - And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
  ans:
  - It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.

- que:
  - What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
  ans:
  - Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.

- que:
  - Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
  ans:
  - Melville, huh? It's been a while.

- que:
  - Jesus, what happened to you?
  ans:
  - It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you all about it... ... but not here.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville?
  ans:
  - Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.

- que:
  - Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn't seem to be too long.

- que:
  - What'll it be, Auggie?
  ans:
  - Uh... My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.

- que:
  - What about for you?
  ans:
  - For me? I'll have the same thing.

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.

- que:
  - Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
  ans:
  - Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.

- que:
  - The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Definitely. I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.

- que:
  - Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First. Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
  ans:
  - Seven eighty-five out of twenty. Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

- que:
  - Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
  ans:
  - No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.

- que:
  - It's yours?
  ans:
  - It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.

- que:
  - How'd you get started?
  ans:
  - Taking pictures? It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.

- que:
  - Amazing. I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
  ans:
  - It's kind of overwhelming.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.

- que:
  - Slow down, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.

- que:
  - So, what brings you to a dive like this?
  ans:
  - It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.

- que:
  - Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.

- que:
  - Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
  ans:
  - He's crazy.

- que:
  - Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
  ans:
  - Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.

- que:
  - You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
  ans:
  - Not a peep.

- que:
  - Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
  ans:
  - It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.

- que:
  - Hey, man, how's it going?
  ans:
  - Hi, Auggie.

- que:
  - Two, right?
  ans:
  - Uh, better make it one.

- que:
  - Anything good?
  ans:
  - It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.

- que:
  - I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
  ans:
  - You got it.

- que:
  - So. Are we ready?
  ans:
  - Ready. Any time you are.

- que:
  - Did you ever go back to see her?
  ans:
  - She probably died.

- que:
  - Anything for art, eh, Paul?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.

- que:
  - And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, I suppose I do.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean, it's a good story.

- que:
  - Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
  ans:
  - Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.

- que:
  - And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
  ans:
  - You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.

- que:
  - All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
  ans:
  - Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up. I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.

- que:
  - Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
  ans:
  - Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything. And besides, it's not for me. It's for our daughter.

- que:
  - I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
  ans:
  - Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now. Was that your idea to call her Felicity?

- que:
  - You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.

- que:
  - Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
  ans:
  - Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.

- que:
  - You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
  ans:
  - I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.

- que:
  - You don't give up, do you?
  ans:
  - Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.

- que:
  - Yeah, like what?
  ans:
  - That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.

- que:
  - And what's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - She looks just like you.

- que:
  - So you're just going to give up and go home?
  ans:
  - I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.

- que:
  - Why don't you open it and find out?
  ans:
  - Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.

- que:
  - And you're giving it to me?
  ans:
  - It's all yours, baby.

- que:
  - For keeps?
  ans:
  - For keeps.

- que:
  - How long you been working for me, Auggie?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.

- que:
  - It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe because I love you so much, boss.

- que:
  - You don't take anything seriously, do you?
  ans:
  - I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.

- que:
  - I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
  ans:
  - Sure thing. See you later.

- que:
  - This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
  ans:
  - It's for you.

- que:
  - For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
  ans:
  - Open it.

- que:
  - What is this, some kind of joke?
  ans:
  - No, it's five thousand dollars.

- que:
  - And why the hell would you give me money?
  ans:
  - So I can get my job back.

- que:
  - Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
  ans:
  - To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.

- que:
  - You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
  ans:
  - Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.

- que:
  - How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.

- que:
  - Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
  ans:
  - Sure, Auggie, I got it. The store's closed. And when do I tell them it's open?

- que:
  - Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
  ans:
  - I thought maybe he was pretending.

- que:
  - And how much are these?
  ans:
  - Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.

- que:
  - And these?
  ans:
  - Fifty-six. That girl had on a corset.

- que:
  - And these?
  ans:
  - Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.

- que:
  - The refrigerator?
  ans:
  - Thanks for the tip.

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.

- que:
  - The damn lock's broken again. And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas.

- que:
  - Thomas? Who's Thomas?
  ans:
  - Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.

- que:
  - Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
  ans:
  - Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.

- que:
  - As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
  ans:
  - Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!

- que:
  - His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
  ans:
  - That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.

- que:
  - He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
  ans:
  - He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.

- que:
  - And his parents?
  ans:
  - His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.

- que:
  - Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
  ans:
  - He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.

- que:
  - Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - And you told your nephew about it?
  ans:
  - I figured he had a right to know.

- que:
  - Those are pretty hostile words.
  ans:
  - And?

- que:
  - You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
  ans:
  - Jesus.

- que:
  - You going to sit here all day?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

- que:
  - I'm not going to rob you, mister. Do I look like a thief?
  ans:
  - I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.

- que:
  - Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I just tell it like it is, mister. If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.

- que:
  - You named the kid after yourself, huh?
  ans:
  - That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.

- que:
  - Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
  ans:
  - Thomas.

- que:
  - Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
  ans:
  - Thomas.

- que:
  - Yeah? Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's me, honey. It's Mom.

- que:
  - What do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.

- que:
  - Baby? And what baby is that?
  ans:
  - Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.

- que:
  - I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
  ans:
  - What are you talking about?

- que:
  - Yeah? And why is that?
  ans:
  - Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.

- que:
  - You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
  ans:
  - Tick-tock, tick-tock.

- que:
  - So what's the time?
  ans:
  - Twelve-eleven. Twelve-twelve. Twelve-twelve.

- que:
  - And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
  ans:
  - East Seventy-fourth Street.

- que:
  - Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
  ans:
  - That's where the what comes in.

- que:
  - You can't be more specific than that?
  ans:
  - Here and there. Around.

- que:
  - But your body is in the world, isn't it? If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
  ans:
  - People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.

- que:
  - I'm not \"people.\" I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
  ans:
  - Thanks, but I'll manage.

- que:
  - Nice drawing. Did you do that?
  ans:
  - My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.

- que:
  - Is your father an artist?
  ans:
  - No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.

- que:
  - He's dead?
  ans:
  - Drawing's a good thing.

- que:
  - Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sometimes. I like to dabble, too.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Eight-thirty.

- que:
  - Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.

- que:
  - A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.

- que:
  - Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
  ans:
  - If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise. It might be worth it.

- que:
  - How long have you been here?
  ans:
  - Three nights.

- que:
  - And how long did I tell you you could stay?
  ans:
  - Two or three nights.

- que:
  - I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ... But all good things have to come to an end, right?
  ans:
  - No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.

- que:
  - Are you going to be all right?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever that means.

- que:
  - Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
  ans:
  - Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.

- que:
  - Take good care of yourself, okay?
  ans:
  - Hey, it's you.

- que:
  - Appreciation for what?
  ans:
  - I don't know. For helping me out.

- que:
  - Where the hell do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood. To make sure I don't run into him again.

- que:
  - You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
  ans:
  - If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.

- que:
  - What time did you get to bed last night?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.

- que:
  - You work too hard, you know that?
  ans:
  - Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go. Besides, I'm making up for lost time.

- que:
  - That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too. So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
  ans:
  - If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.

- que:
  - Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
  ans:
  - No way.

- que:
  - Celebrate? What for?
  ans:
  - It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.

- que:
  - Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - I just did.

- que:
  - Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. We would be honored.

- que:
  - Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that. Would he?
  ans:
  - You don't believe me, huh? Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.

- que:
  - Is it yours?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it might be.

- que:
  - You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you? So how much does it come to?
  ans:
  - Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.

- que:
  - So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
  ans:
  - It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - It wasn't my fault.

- que:
  - Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
  ans:
  - I suppose so. He never told me about it.

- que:
  - If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
  ans:
  - I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .

- que:
  - Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
  ans:
  - Everything is real in here, honey. As real as the color of my hair.

- que:
  - I'll take the iced coffee. You only live once, right?
  ans:
  - If you're lucky. Then again, it depends on what you call living.

- que:
  - How do you want that cooked?
  ans:
  - Medium rare, please.

- que:
  - Fries?
  ans:
  - Yes, please.

- que:
  - Lettuce and tomato?
  ans:
  - Yes, please.

- que:
  - You want another one of these, too?
  ans:
  - Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...

- que:
  - Oh, yeh?
  ans:
  - Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs. Damn thing's still in my closet.

- que:
  - No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
  ans:
  - None.

- que:
  - ...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
  ans:
  - Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.

- que:
  - But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land. So...?
  ans:
  - Carl held it for 'em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December...

- que:
  - In the war. Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
  ans:
  - And when he came home. Did he write you about this? Or phone, perhaps.

- que:
  - What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
  ans:
  - Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.

- que:
  - When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
  ans:
  - That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.

- que:
  - Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
  ans:
  - Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.

- que:
  - Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
  ans:
  - A thousand.

- que:
  - Is that your third question?
  ans:
  - It is.

- que:
  - Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place.

- que:
  - So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
  ans:
  - Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f...

- que:
  - Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help?
  ans:
  - Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.

- que:
  - Well, what if?
  ans:
  - Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in advance? That Carl loses two batteries. Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.

- que:
  - You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
  ans:
  - Happy for him. And relieved.

- que:
  - So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes?
  ans:
  - We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.

- que:
  - Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
  ans:
  - Closer to eight.

- que:
  - You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
  ans:
  - Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.

- que:
  - Up in the air? Was that your reaction?
  ans:
  - We discussed that. And decided not to.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.

- que:
  - But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
  ans:
  - Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people believe is true.

- que:
  - Did you write that column?
  ans:
  - I did. But the jury won't s...

- que:
  - So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager?
  ans:
  - More than eager. He was out to make a point.

- que:
  - Well, what then, sergeant?
  ans:
  - What else? I had the boy teach me kendo. Including...the importance of the bow.

- que:
  - And your evaluation of the defendant? Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
  ans:
  - Oh, in a heartbeat.

- que:
  - And the next one...?
  ans:
  - From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.

- que:
  - And the last...?
  ans:
  - Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect.

- que:
  - So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up?
  ans:
  - You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.

- que:
  - And why. Is that?
  ans:
  - Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war. I saw those kendo wounds, many times. Looked exactly like this one.

- que:
  - Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
  ans:
  - Japanese stick-fighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks.

- que:
  - As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single in its wake?
  ans:
  - Objection, asking the witness to speculate.

- que:
  - My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
  ans:
  - Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.

- que:
  - All right. What did your son say to that effect?
  ans:
  - You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...

- que:
  - I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
  ans:
  - Twelve.

- que:
  - And since you confess this is all pure guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
  ans:
  - My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist.

- que:
  - Were one word of all your fancy story?
  ans:
  - No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt.

- que:
  - Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.

- que:
  - But even after to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
  ans:
  - Yes. Initially.

- que:
  - My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth?
  ans:
  - I have told the truth.

- que:
  - Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
  ans:
  - I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.

- que:
  - How long you have this detail?
  ans:
  - Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.

- que:
  - You mean, early morning the 16th?
  ans:
  - No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th. We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.

- que:
  - Three kids. What's she going to do?
  ans:
  - You said three minutes.

- que:
  - Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
  ans:
  - Have a look. At nothing.

- que:
  - You gonna climb that with one arm?
  ans:
  - You're right. I better use two.

- que:
  - This tastes horrible, hmmn?
  ans:
  - You're wondering why I held it.

- que:
  - Well, why does it?
  ans:
  - Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask...

- que:
  - Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
  ans:
  - Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe...

- que:
  - Maybe...?
  ans:
  - But you could have climbed up earlier.

- que:
  - The knife. What knife?
  ans:
  - Still a coincidence. Timing and all.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast.

- que:
  - Cigarette?
  ans:
  - I'll take two. One for later.

- que:
  - You ever been strangled by a single hand?
  ans:
  - Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.

- que:
  - What for, Sheriff?
  ans:
  - We have a warrant. To search your boat.

- que:
  - You always run with the well open?
  ans:
  - I was checking the cables.

- que:
  - Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
  ans:
  - You gaff with the hook end. Blood's on the butt. Where your hand goes.

- que:
  - White or black?
  ans:
  - You mean, do I like to take the offensive? Or hang back and wait.

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said.

- que:
  - And what do you believe?
  ans:
  - Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup.

- que:
  - Does it now?
  ans:
  - A little. Yes. You have to wonder.

- que:
  - You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
  ans:
  - It is.

- que:
  - But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
  ans:
  - It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.

- que:
  - Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?
  ans:
  - Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.

- que:
  - So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?
  ans:
  - Apparently.

- que:
  - I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
  ans:
  - I believe so.

- que:
  - Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - How is your mother-in-law?
  ans:
  - She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.

- que:
  - And her farmhouse...?
  ans:
  - The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again.

- que:
  - What else could it be?
  ans:
  - Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.

- que:
  - So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there?
  ans:
  - As I testified. It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration. I believe I said that.

- que:
  - In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
  ans:
  - Obviously.

- que:
  - Is it possible?
  ans:
  - Sure, anything's poss...

- que:
  - And death?
  ans:
  - For certain, no.

- que:
  - Can I say something, here?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not. Probably one or two hours. Four at the most.

- que:
  - Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
  ans:
  - He had no reason to.

- que:
  - Carl ever say he got one?
  ans:
  - I can't speak for him.

- que:
  - Improved...how?
  ans:
  - Mmmmmm. Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...

- que:
  - Such as?
  ans:
  - Maybe we could run some tests. Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...

- que:
  - Are these your bags?
  ans:
  - Yes. And that one, too.

- que:
  - I suppose you want a tip?
  ans:
  - Forget it, doll. After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.

- que:
  - Get lost, will you?
  ans:
  - That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy. And get rid of your roommate.

- que:
  - Which of you dolls is Daphne?
  ans:
  - Bull fiddle.

- que:
  - Yes, Sue? What is it?
  ans:
  - I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

- que:
  - Funny? In what way?
  ans:
  - Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk. They went to a conservatory.

- que:
  - Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
  ans:
  - My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.

- que:
  - This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
  ans:
  - It's private. Go away.

- que:
  - They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here. Come on.
  ans:
  - Manhattans? This time of night?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.

- que:
  - Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I'll say.

- que:
  - Yeah. Why?
  ans:
  - Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.

- que:
  - No we're not.
  ans:
  - Dentist? We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?

- que:
  - We're not?
  ans:
  - First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.

- que:
  - What are you giving me with the rabbit?
  ans:
  - Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.

- que:
  - But suppose he loses?
  ans:
  - What are you worried about? This job is going to last a long time.

- que:
  - Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
  ans:
  - But suppose it doesn't?

- que:
  - Yeah - where were you?
  ans:
  - With you.

- que:
  - So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion... Right?
  ans:
  - Right. We have the same blood type...

- que:
  - All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
  ans:
  - It's twelve bucks. We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.

- que:
  - It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
  ans:
  - I'll think of something. Don't crowd me.

- que:
  - They got the bull-fiddle.
  ans:
  - Knock it off, will you?

- que:
  - You don't see any blood?
  ans:
  - Not yet. But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over. Type O.

- que:
  - Where are we running, Joe?
  ans:
  - The police? We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo. Wabash 1098.

- que:
  - Shave? At a time like this? Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
  ans:
  - Shave our legs, stupid.

- que:
  - How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
  ans:
  - Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.

- que:
  - With those legs? Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - It's no use. We'll never get away with it, Joe.

- que:
  - DAPHNE?
  ans:
  - Tore off one of my chests.

- que:
  - Polish?
  ans:
  - I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive. There'll be no buzzing around tonight.

- que:
  - But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
  ans:
  - Fight it.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I got pinched in the elevator.

- que:
  - Blow where?
  ans:
  - You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.

- que:
  - What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
  ans:
  - So you got pinched in the elevator. So what? Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?

- que:
  - Don't get burned, Daphne.
  ans:
  - Me? After Sugar?

- que:
  - Of course, you're not. I'm going.
  ans:
  - What message? What motorboat?

- que:
  - You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
  ans:
  - No. I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.

- que:
  - And where's he going to be?
  ans:
  - He's going to be ashore with you.

- que:
  - With ME?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
  ans:
  - Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.

- que:
  - Don't give me the musketeers! How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
  ans:
  - Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.

- que:
  - What are you doing with my flowers?
  ans:
  - I'm just borrowing them. You'll get them back tomorrow.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I'm engaged.

- que:
  - Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - WHAT?
  ans:
  - Osgood proposed to me. We're planning a June wedding.

- que:
  - But you're not a girl. You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
  ans:
  - Security.

- que:
  - Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
  ans:
  - We've been discussing that. He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.

- que:
  - You're out of your mind! How can you get away with this?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't expect it to last. I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

- que:
  - Like when?
  ans:
  - Hey - these are real diamonds.

- que:
  - Get it while you're young. And you better fix your lips. You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
  ans:
  - It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.

- que:
  - What are you giving me with the omelette?
  ans:
  - Shut up and keep packing.

- que:
  - Sugar?
  ans:
  - Get me Room 414.

- que:
  - Telephone call? Who's got time for that?
  ans:
  - We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.

- que:
  - Wait a minute - my bracelet. What happened to my bracelet?
  ans:
  - What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.

- que:
  - All right. What happened to our bracelet?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.

- que:
  - All right - so what do we do now?
  ans:
  - First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.

- que:
  - Did you hear that?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.

- que:
  - What'll I tell him?
  ans:
  - Tell him you're going to elope with him.

- que:
  - That's all right. I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
  ans:
  - That's us. I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.

- que:
  - Are my seams straight?
  ans:
  - I'll say.

- que:
  - I'm not crowding you, am I?
  ans:
  - No. It's nice and cozy.

- que:
  - Anything wrong?
  ans:
  - No, no.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I'm a very sick girl.

- que:
  - You got some?
  ans:
  - I know where to get some. Don't move.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - How's the bottle?
  ans:
  - Half-full.

- que:
  - What's the surprise?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh. Not yet.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - We better have a drink first.

- que:
  - Who needs vermouth?
  ans:
  - We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.

- que:
  - A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
  ans:
  - You betcha.

- que:
  - We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
  ans:
  - Oh, I have some suntan lotion.

- que:
  - What do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You're so flat-chested. Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.

- que:
  - His yacht?
  ans:
  - It sleeps twelve. This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.

- que:
  - Or was it Bryn Mawr?
  ans:
  - Oh, please do come. Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun. And bring your yacht.

- que:
  - Well, I'll be - ! How about that guy?
  ans:
  - Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.

- que:
  - Do you suppose she went out shopping?
  ans:
  - That's it. Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.

- que:
  - I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
  ans:
  - What do you think, Josephine? What does it say in your crystal ball?

- que:
  - Did he get fresh?
  ans:
  - Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around. You see he needs help.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  - I always did.

- que:
  - Where did you girls play before?
  ans:
  - Oh - here and there - and around.

- que:
  - Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
  ans:
  - Yes. For a whole year.

- que:
  - What's the big idea?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare. Something I ate. I'm not at all well. See? Hot water bottle.

- que:
  - What's wrong with us?
  ans:
  - Help yourself.

- que:
  - Thank you. Aren't you a sweetheart?
  ans:
  - It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.

- que:
  - You invest in shows?
  ans:
  - No - it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.

- que:
  - Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
  ans:
  - You're not sure?

- que:
  - If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
  ans:
  - Sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.

- que:
  - Oh, of course. which of these instruments do you play?
  ans:
  - Bull fiddle.

- que:
  - Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
  ans:
  - Most of the time I slap it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

- que:
  - Goodbye?
  ans:
  - This is where I get off.

- que:
  - Daphne...
  ans:
  - Who?

- que:
  - Yes, Osgood?
  ans:
  - Flower girl.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.

- que:
  - This is her roommate. Daphne can't talk right now. Is it anything urgent?
  ans:
  - Well, it is to me. Will you give her a message? I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.

- que:
  - That's good thinking. Daphne's a push-over for him.
  ans:
  - Just the two of you? What about the crew?

- que:
  - Don't I know you two from somewhere?
  ans:
  - We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight - Come on, Jerry.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - To Urbana. It's a hundred miles.

- que:
  - Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
  ans:
  - I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here! Long distance? Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.

- que:
  - You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
  ans:
  - The instruments are right, but you are not. I want to speak to Mr. Morris.

- que:
  - The wrong shape? You looking for hunchbacks or something?
  ans:
  - It's not the backs that worry me.

- que:
  - Well, here we are.
  ans:
  - What kind of band is this, anyway?

- que:
  - You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
  ans:
  - Yes, we're the new girls.

- que:
  - Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
  ans:
  - No - funerals.

- que:
  - All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
  ans:
  - We got time off for good behavior.

- que:
  - If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band. You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
  ans:
  - Yes. I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.

- que:
  - Where did he conduct?
  ans:
  - On the Baltimore and Ohio.

- que:
  - Running away? From what?
  ans:
  - Don't get me started on that. Want a drink? It's bourbon.

- que:
  - If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
  ans:
  - I'm not very bright, I guess.

- que:
  - Then why did you take this job?
  ans:
  - I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.

- que:
  - Rough?
  ans:
  - You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.

- que:
  - You don't say?
  ans:
  - Men!

- que:
  - You are?
  ans:
  - That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About the future. You know - like a husband? That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.

- que:
  - What's in Florida?
  ans:
  - Millionaires. Flocks of them. They all go south for the winter. Like birds.

- que:
  - Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.

- que:
  - I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
  ans:
  - Glasses?

- que:
  - What's happened?
  ans:
  - Search me. I mean - I'll see.

- que:
  - Would you mind terribly?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Saxophone player?
  ans:
  - Forget it, Sugar, will you? Forget about saxophone players. You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.

- que:
  - What makes you so sure?
  ans:
  - Just my feminine intuition.

- que:
  - You're not hurt, are you?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, don't worry. I won't sue you - no matter who you are.

- que:
  - Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
  ans:
  - Not very likely.

- que:
  - Are you staying at the hotel?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Your view of what?
  ans:
  - They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

- que:
  - Which one is yours - the big one?
  ans:
  - Certainly not. with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.

- que:
  - I quite agree. Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
  ans:
  - No, my flag steward.

- que:
  - That's very interesting.
  ans:
  - And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?

- que:
  - How's the stock market?
  ans:
  - Up, up, up.

- que:
  - Could be. Do you play the market?
  ans:
  - No - the ukulele. And I sing.

- que:
  - For your own amusement?
  ans:
  - Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

- que:
  - You're society girls?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. Quite. You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.

- que:
  - Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Real hot.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.

- que:
  - Tonight?
  ans:
  - I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.

- que:
  - You collect shells?
  ans:
  - Yes. So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.

- que:
  - Shell Oil?
  ans:
  - Please - no names. Just call me Junior.

- que:

  - I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
  ans:
  - It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.

- que:
  - Three?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.

- que:
  - What thing?
  ans:
  - They just sort of leave me cold.

- que:
  - You mean - like frigid?
  ans:
  - It's more like a mental block. When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.

- que:
  - Have you tried?
  ans:
  - Have I? I'm trying all the time.

- que:
  - Nothing at all?
  ans:
  - Complete washout.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I don't want to bore you.

- que:
  - Is that anything?
  ans:
  - Thanks just the same.

- que:
  - I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
  ans:
  - All right - if you insist.

- que:
  - Anything this time?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry.

- que:
  - Would you like a little more champagne? And maybe if we had some music - - how do you dim these lights?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

- que:
  - How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
  ans:
  - Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Did you have a nice time?
  ans:
  - Nice? It was suicidally beautiful.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - From a rich millionaire.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.

- que:
  - Tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - Not tomorrow, either. You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.

- que:
  - A merger? How long will you be gone?
  ans:
  - Quite a while. As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.

- que:
  - I only wish there were something I could do for you.
  ans:
  - You're not?

- que:
  - Yes, they're here. Oh - white orchids. Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante. What's this?
  ans:
  - What's what? Oh, that. just a little going away present.

- que:
  - Real diamonds. They must be worth their weight in gold. Are you always this generous?
  ans:
  - Not always. But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.

- que:
  - What's the matter, Sugar?
  ans:
  - I don't know. All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.

  ans:
  - Sorry, sir. That's reserved for members of the immediate family.

- que:
  - Who's going to raid a funeral?
  ans:
  - Some people got no respect for the dead.

- que:
  - Go where?
  ans:
  - Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.

- que:
  - From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.

  ans:

  - Who are you, kid?
  ans:
  - My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.

- que:
  - You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
  ans:
  - Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

- que:
  - What's the password?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I guess.

- que:
  - Do you see them? Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
  ans:
  - Dude, we don't have watches.

- que:
  - What's a butfor?
  ans:
  - For pooping, silly.

- que:
  - What's a dying giraffe sound like?
  ans:
  - Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.

- que:
  - Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
  ans:
  - Kyle, check it out.

- que:
  - What? What don't I get? What don't I get?
  ans:
  - I don't know, dude.

- que:
  - Yeah, they suck.
  ans:
  - Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?

- que:
  - I'll just try the first one.
  ans:
  - Does it say what the clitoris is?

- que:
  - Dude, do you know what you're doing?
  ans:
  - No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.

- que:
  - Yeah, so what do we say?
  ans:
  - I thought you had something planned.

- que:
  - Sweet.
  ans:
  - Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

- que:
  - Are you sure, Kenny?
  ans:
  - Thank you, Kenny.

- que:
  - As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
  ans:
  - What is 'fisting'?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm needing lunch.

- que:
  - What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
  ans:
  - Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.

- que:
  - What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
  ans:
  - It's from your mother.

- que:
  - I know, Terrance. I know.
  ans:
  - My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?

- que:
  - I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
  ans:
  - What's going on Terrance?

- que:
  - Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
  ans:
  - Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.

- que:
  - Who's my cream puff?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
  ans:
  - You know I do.

- que:
  - What did you do today Satan?
  ans:
  - You don't care.

- que:
  - What if I just left?
  ans:
  - Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.

- que:
  - Relax bitch! You're better seen, not hear okay?
  ans:
  - Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?! You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.

- que:
  - Did you see that, Wendy?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
  ans:
  - Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about, kid?
  ans:
  - Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.

- que:
  - Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
  ans:
  - My friend the clitoris told me.

- que:
  - You didn't?
  ans:
  - No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

- que:
  - You don't have watches?
  ans:
  - Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.

- que:
  - And ze rope?
  ans:
  - Check.

- que:
  - It can't be.
  ans:
  - And the butfor?

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - You're Warren Wayne.

- que:
  - Koros, as in...Koros? Dimitri Koros?
  ans:
  - My grandfather. My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.

- que:
  - So, what brings you out here? Pleasure cruise?
  ans:
  - Of course, of course...

- que:
  - Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?
  ans:
  - It certainly is.

- que:
  - Where the hell did you come from?
  ans:
  - Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.

- que:
  - Weren't you down in the dining room?
  ans:
  - I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning properly.

- que:
  - You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
  ans:
  - I did nothing to the monitors.

- que:
  - And what are they doing now, Mac?
  ans:
  - They are awaiting further information.

- que:
  - Were you going to give it to them?
  ans:
  - I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.

- que:
  - On channel 10?
  ans:
  - The device has stopped responding.

- que:
  - What did you say to me?
  ans:
  - It's a little late for you to be up.

- que:
  - No, I just ran it! Why are you running it again?
  ans:
  - Well it's a good thing that I did.

- que:
  - There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
  ans:
  - Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.

- que:
  - You're certain of that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.

- que:
  - Why, didn't they say?
  ans:
  - Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.

- que:
  - You want to go back to shuttle work?
  ans:
  - It's steady, good benefits.

- que:
  - What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
  ans:
  - Uh...

- que:
  - Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
  ans:
  - No. I'm all set. Thanks.

- que:
  - Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
  ans:
  - Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.

- que:
  - Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
  ans:
  - What is the condition of the bridge?

- que:
  - It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
  ans:
  - Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco. Please proceed.

- que:
  - We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
  ans:
  - Well, preferably in tens and twenties...

- que:
  - Mac, can you hear me? Come in?
  ans:
  - Taylor, you surprise me.

- que:
  - Barnes?
  ans:
  - That's me.

- que:
  - Break it down to me, what's going on?
  ans:
  - Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.

- que:
  - Will do. What about the distress signal?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I really haven't made up my mind yet. We'll see how nicely they behave.

- que:
  - So, what are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - That's clear.

- que:
  - Will you shut up already?
  ans:
  - It's getting hard to breathe...

- que:
  - Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
  ans:
  - This is my second commercial flight. I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.

- que:
  - Like open an airlock by mistake?
  ans:
  - Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening. It's usually the moon walks. Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Still, I hope I behave on the moon. I'll stick close to you.

- que:
  - What are we going to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
  ans:
  - Probably come through the wall I suppose.

- que:
  - I don't think you know what you're talking about. Besides, what could we use for tools? A steak knife? A corkscrew?
  ans:
  - Just considering our options... sir.

- que:
  - Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
  ans:
  - With what? How am I going to interface with it? I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.

- que:
  - Seen one like it before?
  ans:
  - I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.

- que:
  - Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
  ans:
  - We could send Mac. If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.

- que:
  - Are you ready?
  ans:
  - Ready as I'll ever be.

- que:
  - You're ready for the real thing?
  ans:
  - At this point I'm ready for anything.

- que:
  - Explosive?
  ans:
  - One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us. Take this out of the equation right now...

- que:
  - What do you think's going to happen to us?
  ans:
  - Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.

- que:
  - Do you want some advice?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Oh my God. What happened?
  ans:
  - The room is filled with poison gas. The hydraulic system must have blown.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods.

- que:
  - Why? Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm not going with you.

- que:
  - What? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - There's only room on that pod for seven. That's you and the others. I'm counting on you to get them out of there.

- que:
  - But how are you going to escape?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.

- que:
  - Taylor! Where are you?
  ans:
  - I'm in the bridge.

- que:
  - Barnes?
  ans:
  - Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.

- que:
  - So what's going to happen to you?
  ans:
  - I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.

- que:
  - Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
  ans:
  - Hopefully sooner than later.

- que:
  - Except write our wills.
  ans:
  - What the hell are you doing?

- que:
  - That's right. Will you marry me?
  ans:
  - I would, but no one can perform the ceremony. I guess it doesn't matter.

- que:
  - Is there anything I can help you with?
  ans:
  - No, just enjoying the view.

- que:
  - How is it going to be different from this? Go see some boring footprint under glass?
  ans:
  - Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends. Any chump can go to Nassau.

- que:
  - Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
  ans:
  - Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.

- que:
  - I know but we're in a bind.
  ans:
  - What makes you so sure?

- que:
  - Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
  ans:
  - One moment please... one moment please...

- que:
  - But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
  ans:
  - Yes. You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.

- que:
  - Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level? Can they be accessed?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere. I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.

- que:
  - How is it looking, Mac?
  ans:
  - I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.

- que:
  - Is it safe for human transport?
  ans:
  - That's affirmative.

- que:
  - You're not from around here, are you?
  ans:
  - I'm from Akron.

- que:
  - What kind of man?
  ans:
  - A bowler.

- que:
  - Find your bowler?
  ans:
  - My father used to say to me \"Never...\" no, hmmm. \"Always...\" No, no... Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.

- que:
  - You a mini-golfer?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
  ans:
  - No. I'm from Akron.

- que:
  - Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
  ans:
  - Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.

- que:
  - Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
  ans:
  - He's my dad.

- que:
  - Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
  ans:
  - No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.

- que:
  - What do you want with old man Faz?
  ans:
  - Yeah, basement bingo.

- que:
  - You afraid we're gonna steal it?
  ans:
  - Three whips. To go.

- que:
  - We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
  ans:
  - Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.

- que:
  - Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you... What was that he said...?
  ans:
  - You listen to the feelings, not the words.

- que:
  - Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
  ans:
  - Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.

- que:
  - Theo's bowled on the tour.
  ans:
  - Think he bought it?

- que:
  - We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
  ans:
  - Seven years.

- que:
  - What do you think I can do?
  ans:
  - I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.

- que:
  - Where'd you get this ball?
  ans:
  - It's mine.

- que:
  - Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
  ans:
  - She's my mom.

- que:
  - Who are you? Who sent you here?
  ans:
  - I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.

- que:
  - What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.

- que:
  - Putt-putt golf?
  ans:
  - It's the next level, the next dimension... ...the small ball.

- que:
  - What's it look like to you?
  ans:
  - It looks like dwarf bowling.

- que:
  - Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
  ans:
  - I gotta survive.

- que:
  - You got a better offer?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - What about bowling?
  ans:
  - Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.

- que:
  - So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
  ans:
  - I never saw you.

- que:
  - Thanks, kid. Where are you goin' now?
  ans:
  - I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.

- que:
  - Son?
  ans:
  - Millie, please. I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.

- que:
  - Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
  ans:
  - I found dad.

- que:
  - You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
  ans:
  - I gotta go. Love ya mom.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Uh...over easy.

- que:
  - You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
  ans:
  - It depends.

- que:
  - NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knock-knock.
  ans:
  - Who's there?

- que:
  - Who's there?
  ans:
  - JUNIOR! You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.

- que:
  - What did you do to Buzz?
  ans:
  - You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.

- que:
  - Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
  ans:
  - Come on Sheila, knock-knock.

- que:
  - Who's there?
  ans:
  - Junior.

- que:
  - I have someone for you to play with Junior.
  ans:
  - Junior who?

- que:
  - Someone wants to play with me?
  ans:
  - I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.

- que:
  - Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
  ans:
  - If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.

- que:
  - You know who I am?
  ans:
  - I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress. Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.

- que:
  - It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. How's Gloria's thumb?
  ans:
  - That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.

- que:
  - What if he wants to get out?
  ans:
  - He's earned an early retirement. But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future. I wanna show you something.

- que:
  - What ever happened to just bowling?
  ans:
  - There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.

- que:
  - How Mr. Kastle?
  ans:
  - You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.

- que:
  - Why would you help me?
  ans:
  - I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.

- que:
  - Where's Junior?
  ans:
  - Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.

- que:
  - Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
  ans:
  - 132, 154.

- que:
  - Grasp firmly. Then what?
  ans:
  - Line up where you want it.

- que:
  - Like this?
  ans:
  - Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.

- que:
  - He's no father to you.
  ans:
  - I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?

- que:
  - Where can I find him?
  ans:
  - The Peter Pan.

- que:
  - What's your specialty?
  ans:
  - Whips...orange whips.

- que:
  - Do those two work for your dad or mine?
  ans:
  - Mine, and they never tip.

- que:
  - Do you know where they're taking him?
  ans:
  - Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.

- que:
  - What do you want with my dad?
  ans:
  - Business.

- que:
  - Won't your father help you with that?
  ans:
  - Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.

- que:
  - Isn't this technically a scooter?
  ans:
  - When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person. Better than any sex I've ever had.

- que:
  - Where did your brother escape from?
  ans:
  - The mental hospital.

- que:
  - What does he do?
  ans:
  - Whoa.

- que:
  - Mind if I cut in?
  ans:
  - No, not at all.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something personal?
  ans:
  - I'd rather you didn't.

- que:
  - Do you have a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Not while I'm in training.

- que:
  - No. Do You?
  ans:
  - No. Not at the present.

- que:
  - So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately what he wants is you.

- que:
  - Do I want you?
  ans:
  - We'll get into that later.

- que:
  - Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.

- que:
  - Why were you suspended?
  ans:
  - I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.

- que:
  - So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
  ans:
  - Well, that was plan A.

- que:
  - What's plan B?
  ans:
  - Plan B is your dad.

- que:
  - What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
  ans:
  - He said he'd sponsor me.

- que:
  - Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What's plan C?
  ans:
  - Plan C... ...is me.

- que:
  - Do you talk with your mom?
  ans:
  - It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.

- que:
  - So why do you stay?
  ans:
  - I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.

- que:
  - How much would you charge me for the lips?
  ans:
  - More than you could afford.

- que:
  - What are you going to do about your brother?
  ans:
  - You're here.

- que:
  - What about the guy he put in the body cast?
  ans:
  - Then it's true, isn't it? About...

- que:
  - It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
  ans:
  - Nope, I couldn't care less.

- que:
  - I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
  ans:
  - Why should I help that old fuck.

- que:
  - Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
  ans:
  - Zip.

- que:
  - Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. Too late for what?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You got any broken bones?
  ans:
  - No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.

- que:
  - It?
  ans:
  - I told him you were my boyfriend.

- que:
  - How do you get this thing down?
  ans:
  - Tell me what happened Theo.

- que:
  - You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
  ans:
  - If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.

- que:
  - Are you sure he's dead?
  ans:
  - I didn't stop to take his pulse.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.

- que:
  - Why did you come back?
  ans:
  - You're really pissing me off.

- que:
  - Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
  ans:
  - I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?

- que:
  - You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
  ans:
  - I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.

- que:
  - Lips still for sale?
  ans:
  - You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.

- que:
  - Can you change something this big?
  ans:
  - Lane's closed big fellah, league night.

- que:
  - You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for somebody.

- que:
  - You guys got something going on downstairs?
  ans:
  - We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.

- que:
  - Dwarf bowling's illegal.
  ans:
  - Basement bingo?

- que:
  - What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
  ans:
  - You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.

- que:
  - Who identified the body?
  ans:
  - They're like pink snow, sir. Sticky.

- que:
  - How big is this spacecraft?
  ans:
  - Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

- que:
  - In basic English, what does all this mean?
  ans:
  - Basic English? There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.

- que:
  - Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
  ans:
  - Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.

- que:
  - How about I just press the button?
  ans:
  - Not everything. Even on earth. Take ... yeasts.

- que:
  - Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
  ans:
  - The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.

- que:
  - How long will that be?
  ans:
  - They told me about sixty hours.

- que:
  - Two and a half days?
  ans:
  - A squid? The size of a whale? I don't think so. Target acquired. Sixty yards.

- que:
  - What if it attacks?
  ans:
  - Fifty yards and closing.

- que:
  - What do we use for defense?
  ans:
  - We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage.

- que:
  - High Voltage?
  ans:
  - It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface. But we've never used it underwater before.

- que:
  - But you've tested it?
  ans:
  - Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us.

- que:
  - What have you been told so far?
  ans:
  - The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - Nothing else.

- que:
  - You talk to any reporters? Any press?
  ans:
  - Press? No, I haven't.

- que:
  - From what? What's with all the security?
  ans:
  - Well, we don't have all the facts yet.

- que:
  - Storm? What storm?
  ans:
  - A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone.

- que:
  - How deep is he?
  ans:
  - A thousand feet.

- que:
  - Something like that. That doesn't surprise you?
  ans:
  - As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.

- que:
  - Maybe older --
  ans:
  - Geologists?

- que:
  - Extraordinary, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It's impossible.

- que:
  - What team?
  ans:
  - The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.

- que:
  - ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that in years. You mean someone actually read it?
  ans:
  - But sir, I don't understand. This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.

- que:
  - What is it, Norman?
  ans:
  - Take a look.

- que:
  - Picked up something? What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But it's something alien.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.

- que:
  - Like \"Thou shall not kill\"?
  ans:
  - Or maybe, it can't be killed.

- que:
  - You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's the point.

- que:
  - What do you mean, he's missing?
  ans:
  - He's missing. He's gone. He left.

- que:
  - How drastic?
  ans:
  - You don't want to know.

- que:
  - When was this?
  ans:
  - 81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know.

- que:
  - So you knew this when you wrote your report?
  ans:
  - At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.

- que:
  - What am I -- a dog, now?
  ans:
  - Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons.

- que:
  - You don't think weapons are important?
  ans:
  - I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.

- que:
  - Edmunds?
  ans:
  - Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.

- que:
  - You think he killed Edmunds?
  ans:
  - Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.

- que:
  - Jerry?
  ans:
  - What the hell? It shut us down.

- que:
  - You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
  ans:
  - I see it.

- que:
  - Can you open that panel?
  ans:
  - Subs are still at surface, sir.

- que:
  - Any sign of Harry?
  ans:
  - Nothing, sir.

- que:
  - Fuck him. What? Hello?
  ans:
  - Nothing, sir.

- que:
  - What the hell is going on here?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Well, where the fuck is he?
  ans:
  - In the ship, sir.

- que:
  - In a minute, sir.
  ans:
  - Norman, get out of there now! Norman?

- que:
  - How much damage?
  ans:
  - To the craft? None. Not a scratch.

- que:
  - Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
  ans:
  - It's chipped.

- que:
  - Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
  ans:
  - I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.

- que:
  - I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - Ted? Captain?
  ans:
  - Yes, Harry.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.

- que:
  - So how do we get it open?
  ans:
  - Ted seems to have some ideas.

- que:
  - So? What's the problem?
  ans:
  - It's nonsense. There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.

- que:
  - Ladies and Gentlemen...
  ans:
  - Just tell me worst case. Worst case of what we might find?

- que:
  - Who is that? Where's that coming from?
  ans:
  - Please watch your closest monitor...

- que:
  - We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
  ans:
  - ... spiralling out of the center, you see, \"G\" is one, \"B\" is two, \"H\" is three, and so on... when I got the message.

- que:
  - What's the message?
  ans:
  - I have to tell you. It's strange.

- que:
  - How do you mean, strange?
  ans:
  - Ignorant. The thing's ignorant.

- que:
  - Not now, Beth. Please. I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking. Where's Edmunds?
  ans:
  - She's not gonna know, sir.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's saying, \"Take me to your leader.\" He wants to know who's in charge.

- que:
  - What -- you want me to retype it?
  ans:
  - Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.

- que:
  - A half a mile long?
  ans:
  - The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.

- que:
  - What about a crowbar?
  ans:
  - What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.

- que:
  - What are you going to do -- shoot her?
  ans:
  - Look at this.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Some sort of lead or something.

- que:
  - Radiation shield, you think?
  ans:
  - A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.

- que:
  - What do you make of this?
  ans:
  - We had considered it.

- que:
  - Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American?
  ans:
  - Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.

- que:
  - What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
  ans:
  - Maybe we didn't want to come back.

- que:
  - To what?
  ans:
  - Internal power.

- que:
  - From the sphere?
  ans:
  - What's inside the sphere.

- que:
  - Edmunds?
  ans:
  - Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - The sensors are picking up something outside.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It won't register. It's too big to image.

- que:
  - What was Edmunds doing outside?
  ans:
  - Resetting the sub.

- que:
  - Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
  ans:
  - I love secrets.

- que:
  - That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
  ans:
  - To the spacecraft. To investigate.

- que:
  - What do you expect? For them to bring it up here?
  ans:
  - It never occurred to me.

- que:
  - Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
  ans:
  - The timing has never seemed quite right.

- que:
  - Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Drowning.

- que:
  - Where'd this come from?
  ans:
  - The library.

- que:
  - We have a library?
  ans:
  - A bad one. It was the only book in there. Norman, come here, look at this.

- que:
  - What do you mean -- not normal?
  ans:
  - They have six tentacles. A new species. And the squid too. They had no stomach.

- que:
  - And you didn't tell anyone?
  ans:
  - What? Why...

- que:
  - She was crushed. Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
  ans:
  - Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that?

- que:
  - What could have done this?
  ans:
  - Norman.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - Eggs.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - In Edmunds' things.

- que:
  - You went through Edmunds' things?
  ans:
  - He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.

- que:
  - You did, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Don't do this.

- que:
  - Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright?
  ans:
  - Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman.

- que:
  - Where are you going in such a hurry?
  ans:
  - I have to reset the sub.

- que:
  - You, me and Harry?
  ans:
  - You, me and Harry. He's asleep.

- que:
  - Four days?
  ans:
  - Get the helium out of our bloodstream. We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.

- que:
  - Why should I go?
  ans:
  - You should know how it works. Just in case.

- que:
  - In case you die, too?
  ans:
  - I don't trust Harry to do it.

- que:
  - You press a button, Norman. It's not brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You only have 15 minutes to reset it. Go on, Norman...
  ans:
  - You fixed my suit?

- que:
  - I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear?
  ans:
  - Still clear.

- que:
  - You fixed this suit? Beth?
  ans:
  - Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.

- que:
  - Still clear?
  ans:
  - Still clear.

- que:
  - What are you doing in the ship? Beth?
  ans:
  - Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.

- que:
  - You get it straightened out?
  ans:
  - I think so, Beth. Yes.

- que:
  - What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
  ans:
  - Fixing it.

- que:
  - Fixing it? But I fixed -- Where'd you get all that?
  ans:
  - The refridgerator.

- que:
  - You think?
  ans:
  - You don't believe me.

- que:
  - You think it's me? You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Beth. I wasn't there.

- que:
  - \"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Squids?
  ans:
  - Squids?

- que:
  - He translated it wrong.
  ans:
  - Manifested?

- que:
  - What do you mean, a part of Harry?
  ans:
  - When did the messages start? The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.

- que:
  - But how?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How can the sphere do that?
  ans:
  - Which I told Barnes was attacking --

- que:
  - But why is he doing it?
  ans:
  - He must not realize he is. Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then. He must've manifested his dream.

- que:
  - His dream? You can't control your dreams. And you can't control your fears, can you?
  ans:
  - And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.

- que:
  - Why would Harry go back to using a code?
  ans:
  - Diphenyl parlene.

- que:
  - Tarazine?
  ans:
  - Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.

- que:
  - Riordan?
  ans:
  - Antihistamine. For bites.

- que:
  - Damn it! Chloramphenicol?
  ans:
  - Antibiotic.

- que:
  - How do you spell it?
  ans:
  - P-a-r-a-s-o...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Causes sleep.

- que:
  - How long does it last?
  ans:
  - Three to six hours.

- que:
  - How fast does it take effect?
  ans:
  - Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.

- que:
  - Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You?
  ans:
  - Only lab rats. Here.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Not believing you.

- que:
  - In the sub. Resetting the timer. Why?
  ans:
  - The sphere looks different.

- que:
  - What do you mean, different?
  ans:
  - The grooves around the door -- they've shifted. And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.

- que:
  - How's Harry?
  ans:
  - What was that? I couldn't hear you.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Norman?
  ans:
  - I'm feeling better.

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - It's getting cold.

- que:
  - You don't think I put something in it, do you?
  ans:
  - You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.

- que:
  - Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean.

- que:
  - Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
  ans:
  - Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself.

- que:
  - You think I manifested the snakes?
  ans:
  - Someone did.

- que:
  - You're insane.
  ans:
  - C'mon -- what?

- que:
  - Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
  ans:
  - I never went in that sphere.

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - Beth, the message said Harry. \"My name is Harry\". My name isn't Harry.

- que:
  - I'm not scaring you, am I Norman? I hope I'm not frightening you. The last thing I want to do is frighten you. You feel okay, don't you?
  ans:
  - It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be.

- que:
  - Then where's it coming from?
  ans:
  - From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it.

- que:
  - Beth?
  ans:
  - Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's go home.

- que:
  - Would it work?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I think we already know it will.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Pussy.

- que:
  - What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
  ans:
  - No. I don't think so.

- que:
  - Well, what's your theory?
  ans:
  - I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts.

- que:
  - Norman? Where's Norman?
  ans:
  - By the bunks.

- que:
  - Pry the thing open? What are we -- neanderthals?
  ans:
  - All that banging and pounding. I don't know. We should think about making a good first impression.

- que:
  - For who? The fish?
  ans:
  - For whoever's in that thing.

- que:
  - It's empty. Why would someone build a ship like this?
  ans:
  - You'd have to ask them.

- que:
  - Then what is it?
  ans:
  - It's an American spacecraft.

- que:
  - What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.

- que:
  - Just in time for what?
  ans:
  - Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack.

- que:
  - Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything.
  ans:
  - Another attack?

- que:
  - When did it come across?
  ans:
  - Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.

- que:
  - Where's it coming from?
  ans:
  - No idea. We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.

- que:
  - Is it coming from our own computer?
  ans:
  - Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.

- que:
  - You holding up alright?
  ans:
  - Fine. I'm fine.

- que:
  - To what?
  ans:
  - Time travel. A black hole.

- que:
  - I mentioned it in my report. Didn't you read the report?
  ans:
  - Good point. I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.

- que:
  - I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is?
  ans:
  - Not a clue.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - So, we know. The called it an Unknown Entry Event.

- que:
  - Am I?
  ans:
  - Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.

- que:
  - You mean, you think I'm cracking?
  ans:
  - No. I didn't say that.

- que:
  - Then what, Norman?
  ans:
  - It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry? Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.

- que:
  - What noise?
  ans:
  - It's like...

- que:
  - You remember opening the door?
  ans:
  - You were all supposed to leave. You weren't supposed to stay down here.

- que:
  - Tell me about the door. Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
  ans:
  - You don't understand about the sphere.

- que:
  - Page 87 of what, Harry?
  ans:
  - I could never read that far. I never wanted to.

- que:
  - That far in what, Harry?
  ans:
  - These aren't half bad, Fletcher. You might have a second career coming.

- que:
  - Getting anywhere with those?
  ans:
  - There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.

- que:
  - Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
  ans:
  - Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish.

- que:
  - What do you mean? She's not here?
  ans:
  - When I woke up, nobody was here.

- que:
  - Beth left?
  ans:
  - I thought she was with you.

- que:
  - You didn't say that about the food?
  ans:
  - I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself.

- que:
  - But why would she -- ?
  ans:
  - She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.

- que:
  - Wisconsin?
  ans:
  - Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.

- que:
  - How do we decode it?
  ans:
  - Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - How much time you figure to get to the surface?
  ans:
  - Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub.

- que:
  - How far away's the sub?
  ans:
  - I can't reach her.

- que:
  - Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit. Harry?
  ans:
  - I'm trying. There.

- que:
  - You know how to work this thing?
  ans:
  - No idea.

- que:
  - How's that working out, by the way?
  ans:
  - Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means.

- que:
  - You mean forget?
  ans:
  - It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power.

- que:
  - What'd you say to him?
  ans:
  - To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.

- que:
  - What does Norman already know?
  ans:
  - Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down. Thinks it's a mistake.

- que:
  - What is it, Harry?
  ans:
  - Just one of Norman's many secrets.

- que:
  - You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
  ans:
  - Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

- que:
  - English?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
  ans:
  - A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again.

- que:
  - Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
  ans:
  - Think about it.

- que:
  - An American spacecraft? Half a mile long? And buried 400 years? Yeah, good theory, Harry.
  ans:
  - Do you?

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - Meaning it didn't land in the water.

- que:
  - Arrived? From where?
  ans:
  - Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - \"We are friends\".

- que:
  - Does this mean what I think it means?
  ans:
  - It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.

- que:
  - The ships?
  ans:
  - They're topside. We're ready to take you home, sir.

- que:
  - Beth and Harry?
  ans:
  - They're in the sub, sir. Waiting.

- que:
  - Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
  ans:
  - Just that. Careful, it's heavy.

- que:
  - Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
  ans:
  - No other equipment? Scientific instruments?

- que:
  - Captain who?
  ans:
  - Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - By the way sir, I've read your report. I think it's brilliant.

- que:
  - Told me what?
  ans:
  - I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors.

- que:
  - You've heard of me?
  ans:
  - Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.

- que:
  - Know what?
  ans:
  - Must be another Johnson then. Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.

- que:
  - Who's everyone?
  ans:
  - Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.

- que:
  - Geologists? At a plane crash?
  ans:
  - Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.

- que:
  - What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
  ans:
  - He wasn't feeling well.

- que:
  - You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - Strange, isn't it? You know -- how it would have a button.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.

- que:
  - You mean a picture?
  ans:
  - Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put 'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it.

- que:
  - Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
  ans:
  - Well, he's polite.

- que:
  - You want to put him on your couch, Norman. Grill him about his childhood?
  ans:
  - When he uses a phrase like \"I am Happy\", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading.

- que:
  - You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds? With what's out there?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - In the closet. I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
  ans:
  - Don't be so supportive, honey.

- que:
  - How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
  ans:
  - There's a U.S. Navy car outside, Norman.

- que:
  - Was it a military crash?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel. Who's in charge then?
  ans:
  - I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.

- que:
  - Well, I've brought you here. What now?
  ans:
  - We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.

- que:
  - Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
  ans:
  - No, not anymore.

- que:
  - Who's going to pay me then?
  ans:
  - I think there are some things we should talk about.

- que:
  - How much do you think she's talking about?
  ans:
  - A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...

- que:
  - What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
  ans:
  - Darth Vader is on this system. I can feel him. I can feel the Kiber Crystal.

- que:
  - Is that good or bad?
  ans:
  - It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal. Then it could be very good.

- que:
  - There is a greater risk in staying here, you know. If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.

- que:
  - Oh, so you're a warrior then?
  ans:
  - Of course. I'm a Bendu officer.

- que:
  - Who are you anyway?
  ans:
  - You might say I'm part of the landscape here. They call me Ben Kenobi.

- que:
  - You're General Kenobi?!? The Jedi knight! The commander of the White Legions?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars. But I have the memories.

- que:
  - You saw through me?
  ans:
  - You could put it that way.

- que:
  - Could I learn to feel it?
  ans:
  - That is not a human decision, not your or mine.

- que:
  - A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
  ans:
  - I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...

- que:
  - Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
  ans:
  - They use the Bogan Force.

- que:
  - We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
  ans:
  - Five, maybe. Let me handle it.

- que:
  - This is the last place. Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
  ans:
  - He's bluffing...

- que:
  - But she's a member of The Twelve Families. How can they hold her?
  ans:
  - These are doubtful times. The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...

- que:
  - What's wrong? What's happening?
  ans:
  - Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - He can't find Organa Major.

- que:
  - I can't see! How can I fight?
  ans:
  - Try to feel it. Use the Force...

- que:
  - What about the princess?
  ans:
  - You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help. I must try to find the Crystal.

- que:
  - But there was a lot of firing earlier...
  ans:
  - Of course, where you been kid?

- que:
  - But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
  ans:
  - At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.

- que:
  - You're Starkiller?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Have you been checked out?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.

- que:
  - Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
  ans:
  - I've got it blocked. I'm all right.

- que:
  - Blue Five, break off your cover attack. It's too late. Make your own run on the exhaust port. Do you copy, Luke?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir, but I can get him...

- que:
  - Should we alert the Sith Lords?
  ans:
  - There are only three or four left.

- que:
  - Where are you taking us now anyway?
  ans:
  - The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.

- que:
  - Did it occur to you they might find us?
  ans:
  - We must hurry to the base. We have little time before the Death Star arrives.

- que:
  - I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause. What is your price?
  ans:
  - That's pretty steep. We'd like to talk it over first.

- que:
  - Who's the pilot?
  ans:
  - It's automatic.

- que:
  - You don't believe in the Force?
  ans:
  - Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - You can't! We've come this far. We must find them...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.

- que:
  - You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I've never fought anyone.

- que:
  - Is he afraid of the water?
  ans:
  - I don't pick up any life form concentration down there. She'd better be right.

- que:
  - What is it? What's going on? Where are we?
  ans:
  - You're safe. We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.

- que:
  - Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
  ans:
  - He'll be well cared for.

- que:
  - And you?
  ans:
  - I... I don't know. I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help. I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.

- que:
  - You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
  ans:
  - That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...

- que:
  - Tell me where you've been. I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars. My father was a Jedi! Were you in many battles?
  ans:
  - If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.

- que:
  - See Threepio... do you copy?
  ans:
  - I read you sir.

- que:
  - You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir. We've had some problems.

- que:
  - Are you safe?
  ans:
  - For the moment. We're in the main hangar. Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.

- que:
  - See Threepio! Do you copy?
  ans:
  - Something... I've got...you don't.

- que:
  - Whad'ya talkin about ?
  ans:
  - I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.

- que:
  - What do I want with a scar ?
  ans:
  - No, this hurts.

- que:
  - Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
  ans:
  - Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

- que:
  - Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
  ans:
  - Sir, no, sir.

- que:
  - Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
  ans:
  - Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.

- que:
  - Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
  ans:
  - Sir... I guess I do, sir.

- que:
  - What's the hurry ?
  ans:
  - Others are waiting.

- que:
  - Did you read her mind ?
  ans:
  - Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.

- que:
  - How do you make him do that ?
  ans:
  - I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

- que:
  - Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
  ans:
  - I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.

- que:
  - Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
  ans:
  - Eight point... no, uh, seven...

- que:
  - Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
  ans:
  - Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.

- que:
  - I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
  ans:
  - I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.

- que:
  - Are you alright ?
  ans:
  - I'm getting better.

- que:
  - Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

- que:
  - Don't you have to finish the game ?
  ans:
  - Johnny, this is Zander.

- que:
  - Hey ! What are you doing here ?
  ans:
  - I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.

- que:
  - Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you \"sir\" ?
  ans:
  - Only when I give you an order.

- que:
  - Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
  ans:
  - Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.

- que:
  - Or...?
  ans:
  - They revoke our flight status.

- que:
  - Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
  ans:
  - Hey, check it.

- que:
  - Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
  ans:
  - Well, whad'ya know...

- que:
  - Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
  ans:
  - She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.

- que:
  - You and me, huh ?
  ans:
  - I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...

- que:
  - It looks like an... asteroid.
  ans:
  - WHERE IS IT ?

- que:
  - Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
  ans:
  - There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...

- que:
  - So who's got time to get married ?
  ans:
  - Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.

- que:
  - You're upset, that's alright.
  ans:
  - Carmen...?

- que:
  - Where are you going ?
  ans:
  - A funeral.

- que:
  - That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How do you feel about him now ?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Zander.

- que:
  - I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
  ans:
  - It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...

- que:
  - Zander, what are you doing ?
  ans:
  - Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.

- que:
  - Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
  ans:
  - I don't want everyone to see.

- que:
  - How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
  ans:
  - It's all I think about anymore.

- que:
  - Why not ?
  ans:
  - I thought you were going to help Carl.

- que:
  - How do I know if this is love ?
  ans:
  - It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

- que:
  - He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure, I guess.

- que:
  - Are you the boy for me ?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.

- que:
  - Who cares ?
  ans:
  - You're right. Let's never stop...

- que:
  - I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
  ans:
  - Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

- que:
  - Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
  ans:
  - Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?

- que:
  - You talk to Carl ?
  ans:
  - He left this morning. He couldn't say where.

- que:
  - I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
  ans:
  - Do you mean it ?

- que:
  - It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
  ans:
  - It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.

- que:
  - Should I be ?
  ans:
  - Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you ?
  ans:
  - Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.

- que:
  - What happened to your eye ?
  ans:
  - Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.

- que:
  - Which way ?
  ans:
  - Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.

- que:
  - Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
  ans:
  - This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!

- que:
  - Where'd it come from ?
  ans:
  - Just throw me the ball, Diz.

- que:
  - Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
  ans:
  - Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

- que:
  - You still gonna play for Brazil ?
  ans:
  - Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

- que:
  - Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What's your malfunction, Rico ?
  ans:
  - You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.

- que:
  - You saying you didn't ?
  ans:
  - Man, they're defended... no way in.

- que:
  - What ?
  ans:
  - High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...

- que:
  - You used to dance...
  ans:
  - What's that, Diz ?

- que:
  - I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
  ans:
  - Well, excuse me, sir...

- que:
  - Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
  ans:
  - All bands.

- que:
  - Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
  ans:
  - Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.

- que:
  - Oh, my, what's that ?
  ans:
  - Looks like rain.

- que:
  - This time of the year...?
  ans:
  - This came for you today. I presume on your request.

- que:
  - A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
  ans:
  - Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.

- que:
  - Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
  ans:
  - It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.

- que:
  - Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
  ans:
  - We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?

- que:
  - They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
  ans:
  - I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.

- que:
  - Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't mind.

- que:
  - You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
  ans:
  - Sir, yes it is, sir.

- que:
  - No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
  ans:
  - Here in Buenos Aires.

- que:
  - Are your parents currently citizens ?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
  ans:
  - Courage, I guess.

- que:
  - Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
  ans:
  - Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.

- que:
  - On whose authority, Corporal ?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna save Carmen.

- que:
  - The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
  ans:
  - Uh, I don't know.

- que:
  - What is it, Rico ?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.

- que:
  - Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
  ans:
  - Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.

- que:
  - Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
  ans:
  - Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.

- que:
  - Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir...

- que:
  - Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What's that look like to you, Rico ?
  ans:
  - Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

- que:
  - Who is...'V'ger'...?
  ans:
  - V'ger is that which programmed me.

- que:
  - Where is Lt. Ilia?
  ans:
  - That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.

- que:
  - Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
  ans:
  - V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.

- que:
  - Find the Creator? What...!? What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
  ans:
  - To join with him.

- que:
  - Who is V'ger?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
  ans:
  - Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.

- que:
  - Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
  ans:
  - The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.

- que:
  - A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By whom...?
  ans:
  - By the Creator.

- que:
  - To join, and become One with the Creator?
  ans:
  - To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.

- que:
  - And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
  ans:
  - They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.

- que:
  - You are what...?
  ans:
  - I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.

- que:
  - -- You, personally, are assuming command?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - May I ask Why?
  ans:
  - My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...

- que:
  - Programming ready?
  ans:
  - Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...

- que:
  - Explanation, Mr. Decker, Why was my phaser order countermanded?
  ans:
  - Granted.

- que:
  - I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir, I'll do that.

- que:
  - If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
  ans:
  - Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.

- que:
  - Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
  ans:
  - Mr Decker....

- que:
  - Captain, what's the next move?
  ans:
  - The question is, Mr. Decker, is there a next move...

- que:
  - Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
  ans:
  - That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.

- que:
  - I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. You can assure him that's true, can't you?
  ans:
  - No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...

- que:
  - If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Commander' Decker?
  ans:
  - Our Exec and Science Officer...

- que:
  - Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
  ans:
  - My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?

- que:
  - Mr. Spock?
  ans:
  - Impact in fifteen seconds...

- que:
  - Opinion, Mister. Spock?
  ans:
  - Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.

- que:
  - Clear the bridge, Captain...?
  ans:
  - That was the order, Mr. Sulu, Clear the bridge.

- que:
  - Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
  ans:
  - Also -- there was nothing in your report about why you're here.

- que:
  - Communicated with us how?
  ans:
  - It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.

- que:
  - Any reply from them?
  ans:
  - The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.

- que:
  - Our... 'insignificance'?
  ans:
  - We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.

- que:
  - Mr. Decker... ?
  ans:
  - No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...

- que:
  - Spock? Concerned about his chances?
  ans:
  - I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.

- que:
  - Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your personal one?
  ans:
  - It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.

- que:
  - If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
  ans:
  - Captain, I do not believe there is a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.

- que:
  - Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
  ans:
  - A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

- que:
  - Child...!?
  ans:
  - Yes, Captain, a child, evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.

- que:
  - The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
  ans:
  - Precisely.

- que:
  - Not for us?
  ans:
  - No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.

- que:
  - You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
  ans:
  - Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.

- que:
  - Why aren't you on board?
  ans:
  - Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...

- que:
  - VOICE Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
  ans:
  - To you, sir?

- que:
  - Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
  ans:
  - VOICE We're ready, sir.

- que:
  - Evening, Cal. Would you tell me about it?
  ans:
  - Cal...

- que:
  - Annie...got an umbrella...?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - You bringing your new friend?
  ans:
  - Sure plan to.

- que:
  - He have any special dietary requirements...?
  ans:
  - He'll eat potroast and like it.

- que:
  - Go you Huskies?
  ans:
  - You bet your life.

- que:
  - Northern Books. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - I need a typewritter.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The people in New Hampshire.

- que:
  - That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
  ans:
  - Well, it had sentimental value.

- que:
  - You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
  ans:
  - You haven't heard of it.

- que:
  - So young, so unlined, so full of promise. So innocent.
  ans:
  - What's it called?

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - I quit.

- que:
  - Why did you quit?
  ans:
  - Actually, I'm not sure if I quit. I think that I got fired. I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.

- que:
  - Well. Everybody has reversals. If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
  ans:
  - That's good. That's really good. You have a gift for words.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's about life.

- que:
  - N'about ten minutes. What was your movie about?
  ans:
  - No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
  ans:
  - First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.

- que:
  - But why the dalmation?
  ans:
  - It was either that, or a sardine.

- que:
  - That's true. You grow up here?
  ans:
  - Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.

- que:
  - ...that...that he prayed for a second chance. But...do you see?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - ...who...?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station. It was lovely meeting...

- que:
  - They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
  ans:
  - You're still here.

- que:
  - But how do I...how do I do a film called \"The Old Mill,\" when I don't have an old mill?
  ans:
  - Well, first, you got to change the title...

- que:
  - This is, look, Go you Huskies. ...what I...Do you know, you could...
  ans:
  - How...?

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - My glasses fell apart. I lost the...

- que:
  - You like kids?
  ans:

  - Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
  ans:
  - Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.

- que:
  - What about obsessively picking her split ends?
  ans:
  - Anxiety.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...

- que:
  - You feeling all right?
  ans:
  - Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know.

- que:
  - Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay?
  ans:
  - I don't know wh...

- que:
  - You WHAT?
  ans:
  - You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco.

- que:
  - Really. By what right? Six months of part-time screw-ups?
  ans:
  - Life's a trade-off. You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope.

- que:
  - How the hell would you know?
  ans:
  - I don't, but...

- que:
  - How would you know anything?
  ans:
  - And cigarettes. I smoke, too.

- que:
  - Ironic, huh?
  ans:
  - Small world.

- que:
  - Moi?
  ans:
  - Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks.

- que:
  - And you said...?
  ans:
  - Beats me. Ask your mom.

- que:
  - Can I look at the pictures?
  ans:
  - It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back.

- que:
  - Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there?
  ans:
  - Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...

- que:
  - How's she doing with Brad?
  ans:
  - Can I say one thing? I mean, the last thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...

- que:
  - It's covered, okay? I appreciate your concern. Can I talk to her?
  ans:
  - Hon, maybe your mom would like t...

- que:
  - I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
  ans:
  - It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.

- que:
  - You mean, after I'm dead?
  ans:
  - Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna. I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...

- que:
  - And her...?
  ans:
  - Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.

- que:
  - Is that what he told you?
  ans:
  - He won't discuss it. Just calls it history.

- que:
  - Who in the world is he?
  ans:
  - Looks nice enough to m...

- que:
  - He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
  ans:
  - Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.

- que:
  - Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...

- que:
  - You are defending what you did?
  ans:
  - Right down to the ground. Let's get to it.

- que:
  - You think I couldn't figure out some low blows?
  ans:
  - You weren't passing 'em out.

- que:
  - Neutral ground. What's up?
  ans:
  - She likes a Stolie, no ice.

- que:
  - What's this about? Because we fought?
  ans:
  - Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line.

- que:
  - Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
  ans:
  - Maybe I was wrong on that one.

- que:
  - Uh. You hate my guts?
  ans:
  - With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is.

- que:
  - What do I have that you don't?
  ans:
  - Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...

- que:
  - So I'll have to order in?
  ans:
  - We have the kids this weekend, so...

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - But you're not good at this. Not yet. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Why are you taking this out on him?
  ans:
  - Rache, get out of th...

- que:
  - I think so...What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think so too...

- que:
  - Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
  ans:
  - Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.

- que:
  - Are you hungry? You could make us something?
  ans:
  - They're my kids.

- que:
  - Great, wallow in guilt, you sure you're not Jewish?
  ans:
  - She's not gonna die.

- que:
  - Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner?
  ans:
  - Why in the world would she t...

- que:
  - Can we go sit somewhere?
  ans:
  - Let me put it this way. Hell, no.

- que:
  - Where you goin'?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna get me a drink.

- que:
  - Does Jackie know this?
  ans:
  - No. I'm doing it behind her back.

- que:
  - In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
  ans:
  - Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...

- que:
  - What if he is?
  ans:
  - He isn't.

- que:
  - Hey. What's up?
  ans:
  - There's something I need to talk about with you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There are some rumors...

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - You know...Stanley...

- que:
  - He was in a concentration camp?
  ans:
  - Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.

- que:
  - Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
  ans:
  - But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.

- que:
  - Great to be here.
  ans:
  - Hey, Scooby! How's it going?

- que:
  - And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
  ans:
  - Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.

- que:
  - Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
  ans:
  - Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.

- que:
  - Do you have any brothers or sisters?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Really? How many?
  ans:
  - Four brothers and five sisters.

- que:
  - Wow. Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
  ans:
  - It was God's will.

- que:
  - But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank. What did you do in high school?
  ans:
  - I did not go to high school.

- que:
  - Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
  ans:
  - We had to work. My family was poor.

- que:
  - Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
  ans:
  - No, Mikey.

- que:
  - But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
  ans:
  - I'm always working.

- que:
  - But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
  ans:
  - This is work.

- que:
  - Consuelo. Are you crying?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who is Jesus?
  ans:
  - My baby.

- que:
  - You have a bay?
  ans:
  - My grandchild-baby.

- que:
  - Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - Oh. How did it happen?
  ans:
  - He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.

- que:
  - How did they execute him?
  ans:
  - Poison gas.

- que:
  - Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
  ans:
  - For rape and murder.

- que:
  - Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
  ans:
  - It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.

- que:
  - So whaddya think?
  ans:
  - I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.

- que:
  - You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
  ans:
  - Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.

- que:
  - I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.

- que:
  - Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY Good.
  ans:
  - Mom?

- que:
  - Got a lot of homework?
  ans:
  - Marty...

- que:
  - Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.

- que:
  - Is everything OK?
  ans:
  - My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I dunno.

- que:
  - How was the class?
  ans:
  - Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.

- que:
  - Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - What's tomorrow?
  ans:
  - The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I can read it to you.

- que:
  - You mean, again?
  ans:
  - Well, I changed the ending a little.

- que:
  - Oh. What happens now?
  ans:
  - Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.

- que:
  - So you don't want to hear my new ending?
  ans:
  - You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Don't be so upset. It's OK...

- que:
  - What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
  ans:
  - You know he hated my story also.

- que:
  - And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
  ans:
  - Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.

- que:
  - But what kind of pull did you have?
  ans:
  - I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.

- que:
  - I dunno.
  ans:
  - ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?

- que:
  - What DO you know?
  ans:
  - Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...

- que:
  - The same. Same as what?
  ans:
  - Just the same.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - We have to talk.

- que:
  - Whaddya wanna talk about?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
  ans:
  - One in a million recover.

- que:
  - You're welcome. Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.

- que:
  - Hello, Vi.
  ans:
  - Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.

- que:
  - Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Can I join you?
  ans:
  - You're not.

- que:
  - Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
  ans:
  - Take off your top.

- que:
  - Any books you like to read for fun?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
  ans:
  - I hate reading.

- que:
  - Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
  ans:
  - I dunno. See if I have any connections.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Toby Oxman.

- que:
  - So what's going on?
  ans:
  - That's what I was gonna ask you.

- que:
  - Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.

- que:
  - Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
  ans:
  - Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.

- que:
  - Anything I might know about?
  ans:
  - That's too bad.

- que:
  - That's good. So then what do you do now?
  ans:
  - I'm a documentary filmmaker.

- que:
  - N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.

- que:
  - Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Huh. Kids?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - Three.

- que:
  - Great. How old are they?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - How'd you get it?
  ans:
  - It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.

- que:
  - Is it loaded?
  ans:
  - No, I don't think so...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You know...I like you.

- que:
  - You want some?
  ans:
  - No, thanks.

- que:
  - Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
  ans:
  - Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.

- que:
  - Is this to like get into Sundance?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.

- que:
  - So where'd you get in?
  ans:
  - Prnceton.

- que:
  - But what did you get on your SATs?
  ans:
  - 200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.

- que:
  - Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah, we're getting there.

- que:
  - Can I see what you have so far?
  ans:
  - Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.

- que:
  - What is most important to you?
  ans:
  - I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.

- que:
  - He did?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He went to Harward.

- que:
  - Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
  ans:
  - Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.

- que:
  - I'll lead.
  ans:
  - Twenty-five-million! And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?

- que:
  - Why? Are we going dancing?
  ans:
  - I said I'll lead.

- que:
  - Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
  ans:
  - I'm not arguing. I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.

- que:
  - You should listen your old man more often. He's got principles.
  ans:
  - Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me. He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.

- que:
  - I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
  ans:
  - What's that supposed to mean?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Because I'll be firing at them.

- que:
  - Are the labs in operation?
  ans:
  - I don't see why they wouldn't be.

- que:
  - How's the arm?
  ans:
  - I don't know. If you gave me a reason to...

- que:
  - You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
  ans:
  - I know you're not too happy at this point. It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...

- que:
  - Like where--in your dreams?
  ans:
  - I suppose...you think I should thank you.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - He's in there...

- que:
  - Who's Ryan Cooper?
  ans:
  - I'll let the senator tell you.

- que:
  - I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
  ans:
  - And what exactly do they intend to do?

- que:
  - How much do they have?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...

- que:
  - How goes the roll call?
  ans:
  - We're secured. Takeover team is in position and accounted for.

- que:
  - What's happening at the waterfront?
  ans:
  - We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia. Should have it all in about an hour or so.

- que:
  - Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - There's enough in one vial...

- que:
  - SADE Thank you, Admiral.
  ans:
  - SADE Can I have a glass of water?

- que:
  - SADE The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
  ans:
  - Don't be ridiculous.

- que:
  - SADE I have your word, Mister President?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course.

- que:
  - SADE Where are you trying to reach him?
  ans:
  - At his office in the Capitol.

- que:
  - What's the meaning of this?
  ans:
  - SADE I am sorry. Sub-miniature photography is my hobby. It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.

- que:
  - Where is this...thing?
  ans:
  - SADE It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.

- que:
  - Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
  ans:
  - That's preposterous! We have no such program!

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - SADE It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.

- que:
  - Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
  ans:
  - SADE And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.

- que:
  - SADE Don't you dare touch me! What the devil do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.

- que:
  - Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off. Why should they?
  ans:
  - SADE You're absolutely right. We wouldn't. No sane nation ever would. That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.

- que:
  - You mean you'll tell us his name?
  ans:
  - SADE It's not a he, General. It was an article in the \"Times\" about a year and a half ago.

- que:
  - SADE My seven body orifices?
  ans:
  - That's right, fella.

- que:
  - GUANO Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
  ans:
  - I think that just might be it! Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.

- que:
  - GUANO What are you talking about, Major?
  ans:
  - Well, you can't do that because he's dead.

- que:
  - We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
  ans:
  - Look, Colonel. I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.

- que:
  - Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
  ans:
  - They told me, Major. And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.

- que:
  - Okay, Colonel. But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall. Maybe that works, huh? Maybe it'll work? What do you think?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.

- que:
  - What is your name, young lady?
  ans:
  - Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Go back to sleep, baby.

- que:
  - Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Does the threat board show anything?
  ans:
  - Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir. It doesn't show a damned thing.

- que:
  - May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ?
  ans:
  - SCHMUCK To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.

- que:
  - SCHMUCK Be fair, Mister President. Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
  ans:
  - SCHMUCK Just a second, sir. He's got films of the War Room in that thing!

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.

- que:
  - Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
  ans:
  - Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.

- que:
  - What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
  ans:
  - That certainly would be a problem, sir.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER Why do you think I ask?
  ans:
  - I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER Good. Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER Yes, Major. This looks like it's going to be it.
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. What's up, General Ripper?

- que:
  - But...what kind of a shooting war? Have they hit any of our cities yet?
  ans:
  - D. RIPPER Major, that's all I've been told. Just got it on the red phone. The base is to be sealed tight. And I mean tight.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
  ans:
  - You're right, sir.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER Are you trying to be insubordinate?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER Are you hard of hearing, Major?
  ans:
  - No, sir. Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.

- que:
  - D. RIPPER Are you questioning my orders, Major?
  ans:
  - No, sir. I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.

- que:
  - Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
  ans:
  - That's right, Major.

- que:
  - I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's not my radio, sir. I picked it up in the communications center.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. General, can I ask a question?
  ans:
  - Certainly, Major Mandrake. You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.

- que:
  - Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
  ans:
  - That is correct, Major.

- que:
  - And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - You know the regulations well, Major.

- que:
  - Suppose that were the case?
  ans:
  - But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.

- que:
  - That about right?
  ans:
  - Perfect. Thank you, Major. And now let's drink a toast.

- que:
  - What shall we drink to, sir?
  ans:
  - To peace on earth.

- que:
  - General Ripper, can I ask another question?
  ans:
  - Ask away, Major.

- que:
  - Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this? I mean why do you want to start the war?
  ans:
  - I've given it alot of thought, Major. Don't think I haven't.

- que:
  - Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
  ans:
  - I don't think so, sir.

- que:
  - Well, I think I remember reading the report on that. Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
  ans:
  - That's close enough, Major.

- que:
  - I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
  ans:
  - But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?

- que:
  - Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - Where, sir?
  ans:
  - Where? Everywhere, Major. Everywhere.

- que:
  - You're very naive, Major. Don't they say they want disarmament?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. But so do we.

- que:
  - But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - That's right, sir. And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb. What if they start something?
  ans:
  - Go on, Major. You fascinate me.

- que:
  - Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
  ans:
  - No, Major, I don't. They have no regard for human life. They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.

- que:
  - Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
  ans:
  - But, General, we're on our toes. We haven't agreed to anything for years. Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.

- que:
  - But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
  ans:
  - If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.

- que:
  - And you'd like to see that?
  ans:
  - General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.

- que:
  - Do you think we'd cheat?
  ans:
  - No, sir. I'm sure we wouldn't.

- que:
  - Do you think they would cheat?
  ans:
  - Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
  ans:
  - To peace on earth, Major.

- que:
  - I presume the planes are armed?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.

- que:
  - Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch? Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
  ans:
  - That's right, sir. But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.

- que:
  - What the hell is Plan-R?
  ans:
  - Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.

- que:
  - Why can't you cancel it?
  ans:
  - And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.

- que:
  - How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
  ans:
  - We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.

- que:
  - Then there's no chance for recall?
  ans:
  - General Jack D. Ripper, sir.

- que:
  - Admiral Buldike?
  ans:
  - They're coming in now.

- que:
  - How long will it take to receive them all?
  ans:
  - I'm not certain, Mister President. The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.

- que:
  - How many planes did we lose?
  ans:
  - I'm not certain, Mister President. But I believe it was four.

- que:
  - General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
  ans:
  - Naturally I am, sir.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the \"Leper Colony\", failed to receive the recall.

- que:
  - Have you tried the recall again?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. We're still sending it. But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.

- que:
  - Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
  ans:
  - General, stick to the point, please.

- que:
  - Thanks, Binky. Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - What else could it be?
  ans:
  - Maybe it's an exercise.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - War.

- que:
  - War?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Major Kong. I guess I was way out of line.

- que:
  - Speed?
  ans:
  - Between Mach 3 and 4.

- que:
  - Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm shot - it hurts.

- que:
  - Look, can't someone help me?
  ans:
  - Roger.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes, Wing Attack, Plan-R.

- que:
  - Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
  ans:
  - Ready, Major.

- que:
  - Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute. Can you check your ECM?
  ans:
  - So am I.

- que:
  - What does it look like?
  ans:
  - Some kind of signaling.

- que:
  - Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
  ans:
  - That's what I said.

- que:
  - Are you saying our order don't make sense?
  ans:
  - Hellnno, Major. I was just trying to think the thing through.

- que:
  - As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes. All right?
  ans:
  - Primary circuit is live.

- que:
  - Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
  ans:
  - Everything still checks out okay.

- que:
  - Binky?
  ans:
  - Yes, Major.

- que:
  - Can't \"Ace\" help you?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - I bit his jugular vein. Now will you shut up and get up here?
  ans:
  - Sure! Sure, I'm on my way.

- que:
  - Where'd they get you?
  ans:
  - In the back...feels like an arrowhead.

- que:
  - How do you know he's dead?
  ans:
  - Hell, he looks dead.

- que:
  - No, I think it means, \"Recall period Mistake,\" and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
  ans:
  - You sure have to hand it to those guys.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean pulling a stunt like that.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, Major. \"OPE,\" that's the recall code. Where would they get that?
  ans:
  - You tell me.

- que:
  - Why should they call us back?
  ans:
  - How the hell do I know? Maybe the war's over.

- que:
  - Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
  ans:
  - Look, this is different.

- que:
  - Then that settles it, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Like hell it does.

- que:
  - Right. So how could we get any messages?
  ans:
  - That's the point.

- que:
  - Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back?
  ans:
  - Take it easy, Major Kong.

- que:
  - Nobody's loyalty is beyond question. Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
  ans:
  - Come on, King. That doesn't make sense.

- que:
  - We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
  ans:
  - You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.

- que:
  - I'm okay. What's up?
  ans:
  - Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Well, I can't get out and look, King. But I don't get a green light.

- que:
  - Have you tried the emergency system?
  ans:
  - I tried everything. Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.

- que:
  - Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
  ans:
  - Let me check.

- que:
  - Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
  ans:
  - Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
  ans:
  - I thought I'd go along for the ride.

- que:
  - Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
  ans:
  - I thought maybe you'd like some company.

- que:
  - King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
  ans:
  - I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.

- que:
  - Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - At the bottom of mines?
  ans:
  - Yes. The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.

- que:
  - Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.

- que:
  - Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - We are?
  ans:
  - Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.

- que:
  - \"Burger Manifesto, Part One\" is gonna make people think?
  ans:
  - Um-hm.

- que:
  - Can I have some?
  ans:
  - Knock yourself out.

- que:
  - Did you ever hear that saying, \"This too shall pass\"?
  ans:
  - Sure, all the time, in Group.

- que:
  - In Group?
  ans:
  - Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.

- que:
  - How long were you in there?
  ans:
  - Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.

- que:
  - Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
  ans:
  - No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.

- que:
  - It was pretty bad, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What did you guys think?
  ans:
  - Slides go with it.

- que:
  - Why is everything about you, Jeff?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
  ans:
  - Uh, home, you know.

- que:
  - Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
  ans:
  - No I quit.

- que:
  - Hey, you said you did a video?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - What's it about?
  ans:
  - It's really not about anything.

- que:
  - Oh. Well, what's it on?
  ans:
  - A cloud.

- que:
  - A cloud?
  ans:
  - Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.

- que:
  - You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.

- que:
  - Your a nurse?
  ans:
  - No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.

- que:
  - Any gunshot victims?
  ans:
  - Sounds like a bummer.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
  ans:
  - I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.

- que:
  - Where are you-hoo?
  ans:
  - No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.

- que:
  - Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
  ans:
  - Shut up! Aw...

- que:
  - You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
  ans:
  - No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.

- que:
  - It's your birthday?
  ans:
  - Pony's coming here to the corner?!

- que:
  - You wanna bet he's with a girl?
  ans:
  - No, he's not with a girl.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
  ans:
  - I'd get bored.

- que:
  - That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
  ans:
  - That sounds so depressing.

- que:
  - So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
  ans:
  - So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.

- que:
  - Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
  ans:
  - No, no.

- que:
  - Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
  ans:
  - No, no, I wasn't trying.

- que:
  - Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
  ans:
  - No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.

- que:
  - Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
  ans:
  - Oh, and guess who showed up.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look.

- que:
  - What she doin' in the van, man?
  ans:
  - Buff...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She's dead.

- que:
  - She's dead?
  ans:
  - Look, Tim confessed to me last night.

- que:
  - Oh, really? You wanna go look?
  ans:
  - Yeah, man.

- que:
  - Ah, you know people there?
  ans:
  - I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.

- que:
  - Oh, Pony's band \"Dream Girls\"? Been on the road opening for \"Midnight Hore\". Stadiums, man. Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
  ans:
  - Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.

- que:
  - So, how was the ride, kids?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.

- que:
  - Oh, you were in the band?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Your his publicist?
  ans:
  - Sure I am. It's fun.

- que:
  - What do you mean? His girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Well, that's one way of putting it.

- que:
  - Am I fucking him?
  ans:
  - Shit.

- que:
  - I'm so burnt-out.
  ans:
  - Pony, what would you say our relationship is?

- que:
  - Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
  ans:
  - Playing with something really hot. Yeah.

- que:
  - Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much. Did you get your tape?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.

- que:
  - Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
  ans:
  - I can come visit?

- que:
  - Are you talking to me?
  ans:
  - No, but I heard it was great.

- que:
  - So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
  ans:
  - Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.

- que:
  - Oh, So what about her?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we're all above that.

- que:
  - Thanks. See man?
  ans:
  - You know? I remember coming here with my parents.

- que:
  - You make videos?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.

- que:
  - You okay, man? You okay?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to eat this much, man.

- que:
  - Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
  ans:
  - You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.

- que:
  - Will you stand up for me?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Yeah, totally. So, uh, what do they interview you about?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
  ans:
  - No, not really. I come from an \"area\". Bel Air.

- que:
  - You rich?
  ans:
  - No, not really. Middle-class.

- que:
  - He is?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What'd he get you?
  ans:
  - A Porsche.

- que:
  - Yeah. So, what about you?
  ans:
  - What about me? I don't have a car.

- que:
  - You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
  ans:
  - Military marching bands.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - Mm-mm.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Mm.

- que:
  - You cut off your little finger?
  ans:
  - Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.

- que:
  - Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
  ans:
  - Deep down. Way down.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - No, no, see, you, you don't understand.

- que:
  - He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure.

- que:
  - We were?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it.

- que:
  - Erica, you coming?
  ans:
  - Mm-mm.

- que:
  - Two-fifty? They go up?
  ans:
  - Always two-fifty, my friend.

- que:
  - Can you tell me what happened?
  ans:
  - He's drunk.

- que:
  - If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
  ans:
  - Because I'm alienated.

- que:
  - Who were you talking to?
  ans:
  - Nobody. Sooze.

- que:
  - Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
  ans:
  - No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...

- que:
  - No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
  ans:
  - Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.

- que:
  - Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
  ans:
  - Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.

- que:
  - Tim, what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Ask your girlfriend.

- que:
  - What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
  ans:
  - I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.

- que:
  - Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Yeah, fuck 'em.

- que:
  - What'd you do?
  ans:
  - I hit her.

- que:
  - You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
  ans:
  - Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
  ans:
  - Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.

- que:
  - They let you out?
  ans:
  - You lied to me.

- que:
  - Wow. You did that for me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why? Because I give a shit?
  ans:
  - Oh, shit.

- que:
  - Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
  ans:
  - Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.

- que:
  - Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Just go home, alright?
  ans:
  - This is my home.

- que:
  - Will you just put the gun down?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - That, that's Indian?
  ans:
  - Seven-twenty.

- que:
  - Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Look, why do you care, huh?
  ans:
  - Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.

- que:
  - Please?
  ans:
  - Look, look, just get off my property.

- que:
  - This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof! How is she?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I think she's breathing.

- que:
  - Was that supposed to be me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Man?
  ans:
  - Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.

- que:
  - No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About things that are important to me.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...

- que:
  - You know, all you know is what's good for you.
  ans:
  - But do you stand for anything?

- que:
  - Can I talk?
  ans:
  - Typical male.

- que:
  - Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
  ans:
  - Um, because you didn't want to go.

- que:
  - It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
  ans:
  - It got that close.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Jeff. Jeff.

- que:
  - What feelings?
  ans:
  - Us.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - Come with me.

- que:
  - So what do you wanna do?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - New ground?
  ans:
  - Mm-hm.

- que:
  - Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
  ans:
  - My goal is to make art.

- que:
  - Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
  ans:
  - Mm-mm.

- que:
  - So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
  ans:
  - No, no.

- que:
  - So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
  ans:
  - Come on.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - I, yeah.

- que:
  - Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - For a ride.

- que:
  - Wait, away?
  ans:
  - Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.

- que:
  - I've run out of words.
  ans:
  - To his hotel?

- que:
  - Wait. What, what are you saying?
  ans:
  - I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.

- que:
  - Well, what about us?
  ans:
  - What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.

- que:
  - Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, no, no.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Just go.

- que:
  - You really suck, you know that?
  ans:
  - Just go.

- que:
  - Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
  ans:
  - Good, man.

- que:
  - Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...

- que:
  - Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.

- que:
  - Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
  ans:
  - Nah, nah, nah, nah.

- que:
  - Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
  ans:
  - Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.

- que:
  - So how's college?
  ans:
  - You know, I've thought about that, actually.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.

- que:
  - Like songs?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they could be songs.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah, really.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
  ans:
  - No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.

- que:
  - Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.

- que:
  - Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
  ans:
  - Of course it does.

- que:
  - You know what I'm saying?
  ans:
  - No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.

- que:
  - George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
  ans:
  - No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.

- que:
  - I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah.

- que:
  - Hey, where's Erica?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
  ans:
  - No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.

- que:
  - Well, what about this?
  ans:
  - What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.

- que:
  - Look Pakeesa...
  ans:
  - Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?

- que:
  - Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
  ans:
  - Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?

- que:
  - Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
  ans:
  - Ready?

- que:
  - Is that your driver?
  ans:
  - Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.

- que:
  - So? What's L.A. like?
  ans:
  - It's pretty exciting.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Like?
  ans:
  - Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.

- que:
  - New York, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.

- que:
  - Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
  ans:
  - Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.

- que:
  - Would I get paid?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I say what I mean.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.

- que:
  - Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I know what you're saying.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.

- que:
  - You know, my mom has this saying.
  ans:
  - Is that Jeff?

- que:
  - Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
  ans:
  - I think I gotta go.

- que:
  - So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
  ans:
  - Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.

- que:
  - Where's Erica? You seen her?
  ans:
  - Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.

- que:
  - I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
  ans:
  - Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.

- que:
  - About where she went. I mean, what bar?
  ans:
  - She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.

- que:
  - The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
  ans:
  - Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.

- que:
  - It's none of my business?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What are you going to do? Hm?
  ans:
  - If you hit me...

- que:
  - Your manager?
  ans:
  - Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.

- que:
  - Just one?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
  ans:
  - Uh, eleven twenty-five.

- que:
  - So where are you?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - At least I have a point of view, you know?
  ans:
  - Seriously? It's a great idea.

- que:
  - Why don't you go back to where you came from?
  ans:
  - Hey, Tim.

- que:
  - You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
  ans:
  - Hey, your gonna regret this.

- que:
  - Could you give me a ride?
  ans:
  - Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.

- que:
  - The fuck not?
  ans:
  - You know the fuck not.

- que:
  - Another sex dream?
  ans:
  - Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out. Heee hee-haaa....

- que:
  - My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
  ans:
  - I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Di? I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.

- que:
  - If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
  ans:
  - ... I don't know. Probably not.

- que:
  - WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
  ans:
  - I've got to get that. Relax. I'll see you tomorrow.

- que:
  - Spit from your dad?
  ans:
  - I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.

- que:
  - Y'think?
  ans:
  - I sure do.

- que:
  - If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
  ans:
  - Trix...

- que:
  - Oh... What are you working on?
  ans:
  - Jus some girlie things for the squad.

- que:
  - Hat-trick?
  ans:
  - He is the Great One...

- que:
  - \"No\" you're not sure or \"No\" I'm not fat?
  ans:
  - Uh, \"no\"... You're not fat.

- que:
  - You sure I'm not fat?
  ans:
  - Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...

- que:
  - Hee-hee-h-wait a minute. Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
  ans:
  - Oh no...

- que:
  - That you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, hold on.

- que:
  - CHARLIE Kim-Lo?
  ans:
  - I guess there's an exception to every rule.

- que:
  - Ammo?
  ans:
  - Bullets.

- que:
  - ... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
  ans:
  - I-I didn't mean to say \"whore,\" Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.

- que:
  - Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
  ans:
  - You want us to help you pick up?

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.

- que:
  - Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, you caught us...

- que:
  - You got that big retarded girl down there?
  ans:
  - Uh...Yeah, Grandma. She doesn't mean that. Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.

- que:
  - Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate. Where's my smokes?
  ans:
  - I'll get them before \"Touched by an Angel,\" don't worry.

- que:
  - She did, did she? How is the old girl?
  ans:
  - Definitely old.

- que:
  - I don't hate you. I need your help.
  ans:
  - That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need?

- que:
  - My what?
  ans:
  - Your help.

- que:
  - Now how the hell can I help you?
  ans:
  - Okay, you can't tell anybody.

- que:
  - Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk. Whaddya want?
  ans:
  - My best friend got pregnant.

- que:
  - What the hell do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to help. I'm part of this squad...

- que:
  - It must be about that appalling script of hers. What can I say to her? What can I say?
  ans:
  - I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room. I can give her the brush ...

- que:
  - Hi, Artie.
  ans:
  - Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?

- que:
  - Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
  ans:
  - In a deep freeze.

- que:
  - You're going to stay, aren't you?
  ans:
  - That was the general idea.

- que:
  - Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
  ans:
  - Close, but no cigar.

- que:
  - Where's the bar?
  ans:
  - Good party.

- que:
  - Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
  ans:
  - Sure, this'll go on all night.

- que:
  - I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
  ans:
  - It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. This is the woman I love. What's going on? Who was loaded?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.

- que:
  - I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
  ans:
  - Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.

- que:
  - What's wrong with it?
  ans:
  - It's from hunger.

- que:
  - Nothing for Ladd?
  ans:
  - Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.

- que:
  - Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
  ans:
  - Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.

- que:
  - About that luggage. Where's the phone?
  ans:
  - You forgot this.

- que:
  - What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
  ans:
  - I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.

- que:
  - Dark Windows. How did you like it?
  ans:
  - I didn't.

- que:
  - How about the Rainbow Room?
  ans:
  - Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.

- que:
  - Who wants true? Who wants moving?
  ans:
  - Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.

- que:
  - As for instance?
  ans:
  - Well....

- que:
  - You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
  ans:
  - We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?

- que:
  - You'll be waiting for me?
  ans:
  - With a wildly beating heart.

- que:
  - Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
  ans:
  - Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.

- que:
  - What teacher?
  ans:
  - Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - He thinks it could be made into something.

- que:
  - Into what? A lampshade?
  ans:
  - Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.

- que:
  - O.K. Where's the cash?
  ans:
  - Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.

- que:
  - Why should you do that?
  ans:
  - If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams. If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.

- que:
  - What about all those ideas you had?
  ans:
  - See if they make sense. To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.

- que:
  - It will?
  ans:
  - Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.

- que:
  - Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
  ans:
  - Constantly. No, in all serious- ness, it's really good. It's fun writing again. I'm happy here, honest I am.

- que:
  - Who's who?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.

- que:
  - Second generation, huh?
  ans:
  - Nice job.

- que:
  - That's no shampoo. It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile. How old are you anyway?
  ans:
  - Twenty-two.

- que:
  - Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up! Why are you staring at me like that?
  ans:
  - Was I? I'm sorry.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
  ans:
  - Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I just don't.

- que:
  - From Artie. What's wrong?
  ans:
  - He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.

- que:
  - Why not? Don't you love Artie?
  ans:
  - Of course I love him. I always will. I'm just not in love with him any more.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - You did.

- que:
  - Come on in, Betty,
  ans:
  - I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?

- que:
  - This is where you live?
  ans:
  - You bet.

- que:
  - Whose house is it?
  ans:
  - Hers.

- que:
  - Whose?
  ans:
  - Just look around. There's a lot of her spread about. If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.

- que:
  - That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
  ans:
  - Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.

- que:
  - Why did she call me?
  ans:
  - Jealous. Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal. Look at this.

- que:
  - I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
  ans:
  - If you love me, Joe.

- que:
  - That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did.

- que:
  - What assistant?
  ans:
  - Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.

- que:
  - Gordon Cole?
  ans:
  - And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.

- que:
  - Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
  ans:
  - You know, crazy things happen in this business. I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...

- que:
  - What's the matter, Norma?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I'd missed it.

- que:
  - It's a good script, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It's got a lot of good things. Of course, it would be an expensive picture...

- que:
  - Or shall I call my servant?
  ans:
  - You're a writer, you said.

- que:
  - Are you or aren't you?
  ans:
  - I think that's what it says on my driver's license.

- que:
  - And you have written pictures, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Sure have. The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.

- que:
  - How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?
  ans:
  - Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.

- que:
  - Who else ?
  ans:
  - This is fascinating.

- que:
  - Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What month?
  ans:
  - The name is Gillis. I'm single.

- que:
  - Where do you live?
  ans:
  - Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart- ments.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Just a scene I cut out.

- que:
  - Cut away from me?
  ans:
  - Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.

- que:
  - Now what is it? Where's the fire?
  ans:
  - I've lost my car.

- que:
  - Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
  ans:
  - What's wrong with It?

- que:
  - How about some evening clothes?
  ans:
  - I don't need a tuxedo.

- que:
  - Joe, you look absolutely divine. Turn around!
  ans:
  - You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve. Where are your evening clothes?

- que:
  - Cute. Let's have some drinks.
  ans:
  - Come on!

- que:
  - Shouldn't we wait for the others?
  ans:
  - Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.

- que:
  - The other guests?
  ans:
  - There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.

- que:
  - Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
  ans:
  - You think this is all very funny.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.

- que:
  - Cut out that us business.
  ans:
  - What are the notes?

- que:
  - What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Is that it?
  ans:
  - Go away.

- que:
  - What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
  ans:
  - This is the right day.

- que:
  - Did she read the script?
  ans:
  - I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.

- que:
  - When did he say it, Norma?
  ans:
  - Have one of mine.

- que:
  - Where are your...?
  ans:
  - Nothing is the matter. I'm having a great time. Show me some more.

- que:
  - Don't you want to come along, darling?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.

- que:
  - How did it go?
  ans:
  - It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.

- que:
  - I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare and I screamed for you. You weren't here. Where were you?
  ans:
  - I went for a walk.

- que:
  - All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
  ans:
  - I haven't done anything, Norma.

- que:
  - What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am, Norma.

- que:
  - These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you'll only stay. What is it you want -- money?
  ans:
  - Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.

- que:
  - What about the studio? What about De Mille?
  ans:
  - He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.

- que:
  - Wanted what?
  ans:
  - De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.

- que:
  - You are not dressed properly.
  ans:
  - That isn't true! Max?

- que:
  - I made your bed this afternoon.
  ans:
  - Dressed for what?

- que:
  - Thanks. How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
  ans:
  - Some men are here. They asked for you.

- que:
  - Whose room was this?
  ans:
  - It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - The doctor suggested it.

- que:
  - What doctor?
  ans:
  - Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.

- que:
  - Uh-huh?
  ans:
  - We have to be very careful. No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.

- que:
  - You send them. Is that it, Max?
  ans:
  - I'd better press your evening clothes, sir. You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.

- que:
  - No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
  ans:
  - I don't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - She is upstairs.

- que:
  - What's the matter, Max?
  ans:
  - I just found out why all those tele- phone calls. It is not Miss Desmond they want. It is the car they want to rent.

- que:
  - What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
  ans:
  - You must be very careful as you cross the patio. Madame may be watching.

- que:
  - How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
  ans:
  - I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...

- que:
  - You made her a star?
  ans:
  - And she's turned you into a servant.

- que:
  - Joseph C. Gillis?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What car?
  ans:
  - Relax, fans. The car isn't here.

- que:
  - Is that So?
  ans:
  - I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.

- que:
  - So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
  ans:
  - More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.

- que:
  - Got a title?
  ans:
  - Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.

- que:
  - No, that was me. I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
  ans:
  - Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.

- que:
  - Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton. Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
  ans:
  - Frankly, no.

- que:
  - So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars. Only I'm not going to.
  ans:
  - Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.

- que:
  - How's that about your being my friend?
  ans:
  - Forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking about. If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.

- que:
  - CAPTAIN You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
  ans:
  - HOMICIDE Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.

- que:
  - HOMICIDE Was theft involved? Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
  ans:
  - CAPTAIN Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Paramount studios.

- que:
  - Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
  ans:
  - The cameras have arrived, Madame.

- que:
  - What is the scene? Where am I?
  ans:
  - This is the staircase of the palace.

- que:
  - But where?
  ans:
  - I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.

- que:
  - But what will happen?
  ans:
  - I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

- que:
  - What does it mean?
  ans:
  - The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

- que:
  - Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
  ans:
  - Softball.

- que:
  - But which one?
  ans:
  - Sorry, mistress.

- que:
  - Is he your entertainment for tonight?
  ans:
  - He will be. In about five minutes.

- que:
  - I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
  ans:
  - It's what we were warned about.

- que:
  - A Storm Dragon?
  ans:
  - No, a super girl.

- que:
  - Why did she have to show up now?
  ans:
  - Eliminate her.

- que:
  - Am I? Still?
  ans:
  - Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.

- que:
  - Home?
  ans:
  - No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.

- que:
  - Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
  ans:
  - Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.

- que:
  - She didn't take it from you, did she?
  ans:
  - I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Western Europe.

- que:
  - Is this Nigel's doing?
  ans:
  - It's a warning, that's for sure.

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - I'm taking you to the hospital.

- que:
  - When can I see, you again ?
  ans:
  - That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.

- que:
  - You love me?
  ans:
  - We have to have a long talk about all this.

- que:
  - Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
  ans:
  - They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.

- que:
  - Like it?
  ans:
  - Yes. It reminds me of home.

- que:
  - Where Superman's from? Krypton?
  ans:
  - No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

- que:
  - Why not ?
  ans:
  - We're from different worlds.

- que:
  - You don't like me? You hate me?
  ans:
  - Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone.

- que:
  - What do you feel about me?
  ans:
  - There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Let me kiss you.

- que:
  - You're not afraid are you?
  ans:
  - Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

- que:
  - Is this how?
  ans:
  - Terrific.

- que:
  - What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - I don't love you any more.

- que:
  - Just like that?
  ans:
  - Like turning off a light.

- que:
  - But why?
  ans:
  - Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.

- que:
  - Hello. Are you still mad at me?
  ans:
  - I'm not mad at you.

- que:
  - And now?
  ans:
  - And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - I don't see why not.

- que:
  - But what if---it wasn't real?
  ans:
  - Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.

- que:
  - Are you asking me for a \"date\"?
  ans:
  - Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.

- que:
  - Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
  ans:
  - She'll forget about us eventually.

- que:
  - That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came, to find! Where does she live?
  ans:
  - In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Just one kiss. For old times' sake.

- que:
  - And you can see how you feel about me, right?
  ans:
  - Turn it against her.

- que:
  - Hmmm?
  ans:
  - Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

- que:
  - Finished your estimate?
  ans:
  - Well, there's several ways to go .

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - A passionfruit smoothee.

- que:
  - Why should I believe you?
  ans:
  - It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.

- que:
  - Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
  ans:
  - But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

- que:
  - They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
  ans:
  - Well...I guess I can't.

- que:
  - Why the empty cage?
  ans:
  - That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.

- que:
  - Why George, are you proposing?
  ans:
  - Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...

- que:
  - Hey, where you going?
  ans:
  - I've got things to do.

- que:
  - What about my proposal?
  ans:
  - Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

- que:
  - I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
  ans:
  - Do you have any theories about last night?

- que:
  - Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
  ans:
  - Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

- que:
  - Can I give you a lift?
  ans:
  - Oh, no thanks.

- que:
  - Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
  ans:
  - I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

- que:
  - Did anybody notice you?
  ans:
  - I can't help it if men notice me.

- que:
  - You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
  ans:
  - You bet your ass.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - You're supposed to guess.

- que:
  - What's a tree?
  ans:
  - It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.

- que:
  - Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
  ans:
  - Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.

- que:
  - Can you create life?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry... I didn't know.

- que:
  - No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
  ans:
  - There isn't any.

- que:
  - This is all your clothes?
  ans:
  - I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...

- que:
  - Since what? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
  ans:
  - I'd rather not talk about it.

- que:
  - You're not...an orphan are you?
  ans:
  - My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

- que:
  - How'd you do that?
  ans:
  - Must've been a defective puck.

- que:
  - But what for?
  ans:
  - She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...

- que:
  - Why is he acting so strangely?
  ans:
  - I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

- que:
  - Don't you believe in knocking?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - I'm Linda Lee.

- que:
  - No plans for the weekend, Linda?
  ans:
  - No, MR. Danvers.

- que:
  - Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
  ans:
  - I'd love to.

- que:
  - What? Me?
  ans:
  - Sure. Mate in five moves.

- que:
  - Cigarette?
  ans:
  - Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.

- que:
  - ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
  ans:
  - I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.

- que:
  - Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
  ans:
  - You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.

- que:
  - Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
  ans:
  - Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.

- que:
  - Who are you ?
  ans:
  - I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

- que:
  - What's it like?
  ans:
  - It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

- que:
  - Where is inner space?
  ans:
  - It's everywhere. But water is always the door.

- que:
  - This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
  ans:
  - I was on Earth...

- que:
  - Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
  ans:
  - Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...

- que:
  - Others?
  ans:
  - Criminals.

- que:
  - Are you happy, Zaltar?
  ans:
  - What kind of a question is that? Of course, I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.

- que:
  - You look at them? How?
  ans:
  - The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.

- que:
  - Of course, my dear. What can I do?
  ans:
  - Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Then teach me how.

- que:
  - Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
  ans:
  - You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.

- que:
  - Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
  ans:
  - Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.

- que:
  - You're going to take me back?
  ans:
  - Buddy, are we in trouble.

- que:
  - What are you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.

- que:
  - Mr. Roebush?
  ans:
  - Brad.

- que:
  - Brad?
  ans:
  - I seem to be.

- que:
  - You always did. Can I give you a hand with that?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman -- ...uh, chairperson...

- que:
  - And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible?
  ans:
  - It sure is.

- que:
  - You...um...you never got married?
  ans:
  - Oh...I came close once.

- que:
  - You thought that?
  ans:
  - I thought \"Clark Kent has a really nice voice.\" You didn't even know I was there.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about salt. Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.

- que:
  - Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
  ans:
  - Call me.

- que:
  - Uh-huh.
  ans:
  - Can I help?

- que:
  - Well, aren't you excited?
  ans:
  - Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.

- que:
  - Do you really know Superman?
  ans:
  - We get together sometimes.

- que:
  - Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
  ans:
  - Could you get me Superman's autograph?

- que:
  - So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
  ans:
  - Exactly what I was about to ask about me.

- que:
  - It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.

- que:
  - Name?
  ans:
  - Gus Gorman.

- que:
  - Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - A television set?
  ans:
  - Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.

- que:
  - You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
  ans:
  - Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?

- que:
  - What about this week's check?
  ans:
  - Sonofagun! Look at this here!

- que:
  - What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions?
  ans:
  - They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.

- que:
  - Who gets it, the company?
  ans:
  - No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.

- que:
  - So where is all them half-centses?
  ans:
  - They're just ... floating around out there. The computer knows where.

- que:
  - How many sugars?
  ans:
  - One. And a half.

- que:
  - Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
  ans:
  - Uh ... no, man. I got some work to finish up here.

- que:
  - Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
  ans:
  - Yeah. A raise . .

- que:
  - Say what?
  ans:
  - The boss wants to see you.

- que:
  - Say who?
  ans:
  - Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...

- que:
  - Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- \"dig where you're comin' from.\" You want to be rich, right?
  ans:
  - Uh...

- que:
  - Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
  ans:
  - Or socks.

- que:
  - Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
  ans:
  - I don't think you understand.

- que:
  - Man, what is this?
  ans:
  - Columbia.

- que:
  - Wipe 'em out?
  ans:
  - Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.

- que:
  - How do you do that?
  ans:
  - Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hey, boss.

- que:
  - They ain't got captains?
  ans:
  - Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.

- que:
  - Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
  ans:
  - You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.

- que:
  - I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
  ans:
  - Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!

- que:
  - Is this blackmail?
  ans:
  - Don't be getting' racist with me, man.

- que:
  - Is this whitemail?
  ans:
  - Fair's fair.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - A computer.

- que:
  - You designed it?
  ans:
  - I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.

- que:
  - What will it do?
  ans:
  - Everything.

- que:
  - What will it get me?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - Yeah? How's it look?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...

- que:
  - You want to mess with Superman?
  ans:
  - Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.

- que:
  - I ain't about to argue with you. What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
  ans:
  - That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.

- que:
  - We gonna crash?
  ans:
  - I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.

- que:
  - We back in Metropolis?
  ans:
  - Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...

- que:
  - What she call you?
  ans:
  - You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

- que:
  - And do what?
  ans:
  - I know, by computers.

- que:
  - Who is she?
  ans:
  - Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.

- que:
  - Who's the other woman?
  ans:
  - That's his sister. Vera Webster.

- que:
  - Why do I have to do this?
  ans:
  - It was hot!

- que:
  - What terrific story?
  ans:
  - Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.

- que:
  - I'm in no rush. So what do you have in mind?
  ans:
  - Lots of things...

- que:
  - Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
  ans:
  - Never. I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.

- que:
  - No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
  ans:
  - It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...

- que:
  - Diet soda?
  ans:
  - Energy! And when they say \"Energy\" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar? Too underdeveloped.

- que:
  - So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
  ans:
  - How would you know?

- que:
  - And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
  ans:
  - I can't see anything.

- que:
  - Where do you usually find a light switch?
  ans:
  - Come on, will you? We've got to get ready before he gets here.

- que:
  - Gus?
  ans:
  - Superman. The boy you left behind.

- que:
  - How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
  ans:
  - By hand. Like the pioneers did.

- que:
  - Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
  ans:
  - Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.

- que:
  - Why do I have to do this?
  ans:
  - It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art. People, I am in love with this machine. Go ahead, Mr. White.

- que:
  - Where's the handle?
  ans:
  - There is no handle! You just push a button.

- que:
  - Missing?
  ans:
  - Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm.

- que:
  - Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
  ans:
  - He's bound to slip up sooner or later.

- que:
  - That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom?
  ans:
  - Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.

- que:
  - Where did it come from?
  ans:
  - The planet Superman came from. Krypton.

- que:
  - That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
  ans:
  - So?

- que:
  - Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
  ans:
  - Come on, let's give it a dry run.

- que:
  - Yeah. I'll check.
  ans:
  - Who needs Gus?

- que:
  - Anybody been hurt?
  ans:
  - So far the hostages are unharmed.

- que:
  - Hostages?
  ans:
  - Tourists, about twenty of 'em.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - She'll be fine.

- que:
  - When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
  ans:
  - Uh...

- que:
  - I don't?
  ans:
  - Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.

- que:
  - Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you. Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
  ans:
  - Actually, yes.

- que:
  - Be my guest.
  ans:
  - Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Of course, that's what friends are for.

- que:
  - In July?
  ans:
  - Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.

- que:
  - No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
  ans:
  - Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.

- que:
  - I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.

- que:
  - Whoever, I Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
  ans:
  - Superman? Oh, was he here?

- que:
  - Because of what I'm betting. My life.
  ans:
  - Who ?

- que:
  - Well, not in your mind, but maybe ...deep in your heart ...
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
  ans:
  - We'd better talk.

- que:
  - \"What's happening.\" Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so ... where do you want to ... talk?
  ans:
  - I guess it would be all right if - Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.

- que:
  - Do you ... ah ... want to step outside?
  ans:
  - Blood ... my ... blood ...

- que:
  - Sleep well?
  ans:
  - Never closed my eyes.

- que:
  - Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
  ans:
  - What else could I do?

- que:
  - I'm fine... ... What was I talking about? Before?
  ans:
  - ... Superman?... . .

- que:
  - Everything on it?
  ans:
  - Everything on it.

- que:
  - Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been the last twelve hours?
  ans:
  - Uh...home...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Gee. But --

- que:
  - What else is ballast for?
  ans:
  - How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.

- que:
  - Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
  ans:
  - Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.

- que:
  - Why didn't you go before we left?
  ans:
  - It's beautiful.

- que:
  - Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
  ans:
  - Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?

- que:
  - And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No possibility for parole?
  ans:
  - The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - North.

- que:
  - That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
  ans:
  - We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.

- que:
  - The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
  ans:
  - Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Australia.

- que:
  - Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
  ans:
  - Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth ...

- que:
  - What more?
  ans:
  - Cuba.

- que:
  - It will. Starting with your own.
  ans:
  - Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?

- que:
  - Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
  ans:
  - I wish I knew. -- Oh, God.

- que:
  - Who is this ... Superman?
  ans:
  - In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.

- que:
  - There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
  ans:
  - Um... .we have made this guarantee.

- que:
  - Yes, but will you honor it?
  ans:
  - We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.

- que:
  - What shall we do now?
  ans:
  - Stay. I will come to you.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - He... cares. He actually cares about these ... ...these People. These earth People .

- que:
  - General --- ?
  ans:
  - We must combine our strength.

- que:
  - Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
  ans:
  - \"Super-sucker . \" For once, Lex Luthor was right.

- que:
  - What about here?
  ans:
  - Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
  ans:
  - Oh ... Right... I'll be back in a flash.

- que:
  - Like me?
  ans:
  - You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.

- que:
  - No Paris?
  ans:
  - I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.

- que:
  - You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
  ans:
  - Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.

- que:
  - Politely?
  ans:
  - ... Please leave your message at the beep.

- que:
  - Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left... Where are you ?
  ans:
  - It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know ...

- que:
  - And what do we get out of it?
  ans:
  - If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission ... something ...appropriate... a number with a lot of zeros after it.

- que:
  - Impossible? Why?
  ans:
  - Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.

- que:
  - But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't understand.

- que:
  - Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
  ans:
  - N-no...I mean...you bet.

- que:
  - Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
  ans:
  - Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.

- que:
  - Yes, darling?
  ans:
  - Stuff it.

- que:
  - Is he for real?
  ans:
  - One hundred percent. And I like him that way.

- que:
  - Superman gets mail here?
  ans:
  - I think there's an angle.

- que:
  - An angle?
  ans:
  - Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.

- que:
  - What's he going to say?
  ans:
  - Something ... wonderful.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Our other dinner guest.

- que:
  - Where's Clark?
  ans:
  - He was getting on ... and then this man with luggage and ... oh, it's a long story.

- que:
  - A toupee that flies?
  ans:
  - ... I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.

- que:
  - Get the box, nephew.
  ans:
  - But why the hair?

- que:
  - Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
  ans:
  - Oh Leonard ... When I sent the remains of my last experiment ...

- que:
  - The one Superman wrecked up?
  ans:
  - Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Boy, are you gonna get it.

- que:
  - Ready, Uncle Lex?
  ans:
  - If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.

- que:
  - What I need this for?
  ans:
  - For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.

- que:
  - What? A genius? ... an inspiration?
  ans:
  - You are ... nothing. I am father now.

- que:
  - I am an experiment? I am freako?
  ans:
  - I made you, and I can destroy you.

- que:
  - It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
  ans:
  - Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.

- que:
  - Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
  ans:
  - I'll deal with you later.

- que:
  - But ... but isn't the world about to be osterized?
  ans:
  - No ... it's the way it always is ... on the brink ... with good fighting evil.

- que:
  - Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
  ans:
  - Nobody else.

- que:
  - That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
  ans:
  - Not you. You. Tell me again.

- que:
  - A hot story, huh?
  ans:
  - It was hot, yes.

- que:
  - Lois isn't here?
  ans:
  - She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.

- que:
  - What's she doing in California?
  ans:
  - It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.

- que:
  - Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
  ans:
  - No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.

- que:
  - Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
  ans:
  - Do you know where you're headed?

- que:
  - Your bookie?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are there any more at home like you?
  ans:
  - Not really, no.

- que:
  - Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
  ans:
  - I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.

- que:
  - See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
  ans:
  - You described the exact contents of my purse.

- que:
  - Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and -- -- unless...would you be interested in dinner?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.

- que:
  - Don't you ever give up?
  ans:
  - No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.

- que:
  - Can I take you to the airport?
  ans:
  - Not unless you can fly.

- que:
  - Come again?
  ans:
  - I'm telling you, I was there.

- que:
  - He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
  ans:
  - Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.

- que:
  - Jealous? Of what?
  ans:
  - Of this...Superman.

- que:
  - Is that what they're calling him?
  ans:
  - They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.

- que:
  - You too. I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
  ans:
  - You! The girl from the volcano! Kryptonite...

- que:
  - He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
  ans:
  - What are you doing here?

- que:
  - The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
  ans:
  - The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.

- que:
  - Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
  ans:
  - Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.

- que:
  - Me and my real estate? How many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
  ans:
  - It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.

- que:
  - This?
  ans:
  - Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers? A part of that will always be with me.

- que:
  - You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
  ans:
  - Even that would be an improvement.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - He's from another world.

- que:
  - Tough guy, huh?
  ans:
  - I read the article.

- que:
  - Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
  ans:
  - Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?

- que:
  - I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
  ans:
  - I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?

- que:
  - You're happy, aren't you?
  ans:
  - La de da da...

- que:
  - What do you suggest, my dear?
  ans:
  - The least we can do is leave him another door jam.

- que:
  - Weak sister. I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
  ans:
  - You ever try to run in high heels? You probably did.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Ready.

- que:
  - You?! How about me?
  ans:
  - You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.

- que:
  - You're not going to hit me?
  ans:
  - I knew you'd hit me.

- que:
  - A night on the town instead of under it?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.

- que:
  - What are you going to do to him?
  ans:
  - Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.

- que:
  - What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
  ans:
  - He always shows up when somebody's in danger.

- que:
  - Danger? Somebody? Lex -- where are you going?
  ans:
  - Lex is going bye-bye.

- que:
  - Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
  ans:
  - If you persist, you leave us no choice.

- que:
  - Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
  ans:
  - Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.

- que:
  - an Ode to Spring. are there one or two \"T's\" in bloodletting?
  ans:
  - It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy. Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.

- que:
  - Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
  ans:
  - Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.

- que:
  - Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
  ans:
  - I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton

- que:
  - If one of you can get that -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
  ans:
  - He is. Usually.

- que:
  - Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
  ans:
  - Easy now, miss, I've got you?

- que:
  - Superman?
  ans:
  - Right on the first guess.

- que:
  - Wha'...what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I came to talk to you.

- que:
  - Well...flashlight?
  ans:
  - I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.

- que:
  - Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.

- que:
  - Oh. Well, where do we start?
  ans:
  - Ask, You're the girl reporter.

- que:
  - You think they're strange?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Thirty-five.

- que:
  - How much do you weigh?
  ans:
  - 195 pounds.

- que:
  - Can you really see through anything?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Is it true you're impervious to pain?
  ans:
  - Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.

- que:
  - Do bullets really bounce off you?
  ans:
  - Only when somebody shoots them at me.

- que:
  - What color underwear am I wearing?
  ans:
  - Pink.

- que:
  - Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Do you like pink?
  ans:
  - Very much.

- que:
  - Where do you hail from?
  ans:
  - I...uh...

- que:
  - Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
  ans:
  - Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.

- que:
  - I...uh...check.
  ans:
  - Otis, were you up to your old tricks?

- que:
  - And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again. Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
  ans:
  - I guess I...uh...regressed.

- que:
  - Is that real enough for you?
  ans:
  - It is for me.

- que:
  - On radio waves?
  ans:
  - And garbage doors.

- que:
  - I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. Still working with my father.

- que:
  - And what does he do again?
  ans:
  - He used to work with you. Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.

- que:
  - How is Mrs. Stephens?
  ans:
  - We're...not together.

- que:
  - I'd heard that. But she's well?
  ans:
  - Yes...fine.

- que:
  - And Zoe? How's Zoe?
  ans:
  - I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.

- que:
  - Are you still in touch?
  ans:
  - Not really. The last time I saw her was at that clinic. That was a long time ago.

- que:
  - Which clinic?
  ans:
  - Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...

- que:
  - Then...when did she get better?
  ans:
  - She didn't.

- que:
  - What...does it turn to?
  ans:
  - It turns to steaming piss.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Nothing. We made it to the hospital. I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to. But I was prepared to go all the way.

- que:
  - Case?
  ans:
  - I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal

- que:
  - Why are you telling me this?
  ans:
  - I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.

- que:
  - Why are you telling me this?
  ans:
  - I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...

- que:
  - Was it good?
  ans:
  - I'll be back around nine.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - How is Nicole? Is she around?
  ans:
  - She's resting. In her room.

- que:
  - So what brings you out tonight?
  ans:
  - I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Well, it being so depressing and all. But it's reality. You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because it's what we have to do.

- que:
  - Have you been waiting long?
  ans:
  - A while.

- que:
  - Does this mean I can't take a shower?
  ans:
  - No. It should be dry by now.

- que:
  - What time's he coming home?
  ans:
  - When the game's over, I guess.

- que:
  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me.

- que:
  - You believe that?
  ans:
  - I have to.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I have to.

- que:
  - Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why did you do that, Billy?
  ans:
  - Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.

- que:
  - Yes. What do you mean by 'hippies'?
  ans:
  - I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing...

- que:
  - Do they have any reputation for drugs?
  ans:
  - And they loved Bear.

- que:
  - For rabbits?
  ans:
  - Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.

- que:
  - From what?
  ans:
  - Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...

- que:
  - You talked about it?
  ans:
  - No. I saw it on his face.

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - With our hands.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You mentioned that he had a learning disability.

- que:
  - Did they give him special care?
  ans:
  - I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.

- que:
  - What's that, Dolores?
  ans:
  - That would complicate things.

- que:
  - Because I'd be to blame, right?
  ans:
  - Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.

- que:
  - He knows that? Billy?
  ans:
  - Yes. He does.

- que:
  - You've talked to Billy?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - You heard what Abbott said?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Anything you didn't understand?
  ans:
  - There might have been a word or two that slipped by. Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.

- que:
  - That's what he said, is it?
  ans:
  - Yes. Abbot understands these things.

- que:
  - Why would he be frightened?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.

- que:
  - You want a cup of tea or something?
  ans:
  - A cup of tea would be nice. Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto? I want to talk to you.

- que:
  - How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
  ans:
  - I didn't ask if you wanted milk.

- que:
  - What happened to summer?
  ans:
  - Summer's over. It's fall.

- que:
  - And winter?
  ans:
  - Well, winter's far behind us now.

- que:
  - So do you like your new room?
  ans:
  - It's interesting.

- que:
  - Is this mine?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's a present.

- que:
  - From you?
  ans:
  - No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.

- que:
  - That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
  ans:
  - Who's Mr. Stephens?

- que:
  - Did he say what about?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Was he drinking? Could you tell?
  ans:
  - Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.

- que:
  - Is he coming over now? Right away?
  ans:
  - That's what he said.

- que:
  - What's a ditty again?
  ans:
  - It's like a song.

- que:
  - Nicole?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
  ans:
  - I want to sit beside you tomorrow.

- que:
  - What, Mason?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - The people in the town?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - So he was mean?
  ans:
  - No. Not mean. Just...very angry.

- que:
  - Should I keep reading?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - That you didn't die? Like the other children?
  ans:
  - Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...

- que:
  - What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
  ans:
  - I won't lie.

- que:
  - So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
  ans:
  - It was snowing.

- que:
  - There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
  ans:
  - I object to that form of question. Note that.

- que:
  - And what was the weather like at this time?
  ans:
  - I have no questions.

- que:
  - Will you be spending more than a night?
  ans:
  - Hard to say. I might have...some business here.

- que:
  - What about Doreen?
  ans:
  - She...she was a friend of mine.

- que:
  - That's the local bar?
  ans:
  - ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - People who will help our cause.

- que:
  - Indian?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do they do?
  ans:
  - Crafts.

- que:
  - Crafts?
  ans:
  - Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.

- que:
  - Have they ever been busted?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Need a hand?
  ans:
  - Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag. I know my wife packed one in there...

- que:
  - How old is she?
  ans:
  - Almost three.

- que:
  - Is this it?
  ans:
  - Perfect.

- que:
  - Why am I calling you? You're my father. I'm not supposed to call you? What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
  ans:
  - Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.

- que:
  - So what's the problem?
  ans:
  - The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm? Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?

- que:
  - Why can't you talk to me?
  ans:
  - I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...

- que:
  - Daddy?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Don't you want to hear?
  ans:
  - Yes. Give me your news, Zoe.

- que:
  - Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - You can't ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money.

- que:
  - I love you, Zoe. I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you. No matter what happens. I'll take care of you.
  ans:
  - Do you have the blood test?

- que:
  - Some more wine?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid this meat is overdone.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Poached salmon.

- que:
  - Is there shrimp on it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm a lawyer.

- que:
  - You've been retained?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You think someone else caused the accident?
  ans:
  - So you're just the thing we need.

- que:
  - Isn't that what you want us to believe? That we're completely defenseless? That you know what's best?
  ans:
  - Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very carefully. I do know what's best.

- que:
  - Are you expensive?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you a reporter?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - In what way?
  ans:
  - Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up. Used to be smart enough.

- que:
  - Any criminal record?
  ans:
  - Probably half a dozen traffic convictions. Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That's why he don't work no more.

- que:
  - How does the family survive?
  ans:
  - Don't know. Food banks, welfare, church charity. They scrape by.

- que:
  - Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What time in the morning was this?
  ans:
  - About eight-thirty in the morning.

- que:
  - Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
  ans:
  - No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.

- que:
  - Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
  ans:
  - Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot.

- que:
  - And where did you sit that morning?
  ans:
  - My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.

- que:
  - And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
  ans:
  - Until the accident? No. Yes, there was.

- que:
  - Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You remember that much?
  ans:
  - As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.

- que:
  - You are?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Before the actual accident?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
  ans:
  - Yes, I understand.

- que:
  - Why were you scared?
  ans:
  - Dolores was driving too fast.

- que:
  - Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
  ans:
  - The speedometer. And it was downhill there.

- que:
  - You could see the speedometer?
  ans:
  - Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.

- que:
  - How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection?
  ans:
  - Seventy-two miles an hour.

- que:
  - Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
  ans:
  - Positive.

- que:
  - You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
  ans:
  - I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.

- que:
  - You saw the speedometer?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I was scared. And there wasn't time.

- que:
  - There wasn't time?
  ans:
  - No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.

- que:
  - You remember this?
  ans:
  - Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.

- que:
  - What do you remember about the accident?
  ans:
  - That was great.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - You're going to blow everyone away.

- que:
  - You mean it?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What's so funny?
  ans:
  - Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals. It's like the biggest thing in her life.

- que:
  - What took so long?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Ansel's clothing.

- que:
  - Does it fit?
  ans:
  - They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.

- que:
  - Pretty slick, eh?
  ans:
  - Very slick.

- que:
  - Do you like the colour?
  ans:
  - It's okay.

- que:
  - You and Mom have a lawyer?
  ans:
  - Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.

- que:
  - My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?
  ans:
  - But you didn't lose me.

- que:
  - What are you up to, Nicole?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Are you sleeping?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well, okay. I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning. That's okay with you?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - What's going to happen to Dolores?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Will the police do anything to her?
  ans:
  - It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.

- que:
  - Is \"he\" inside?
  ans:
  - But of course...

- que:
  - Alone or surrounded?
  ans:
  - A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.

- que:
  - Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
  ans:
  - You don't like it, do you. I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.

- que:
  - See my mother?
  ans:
  - I only had a few hours.

- que:
  - You told him that?
  ans:
  - Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.

- que:
  - When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
  ans:
  - Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.

- que:
  - That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?
  ans:
  - Four five nights ago. That's how I know the romance is off. Also Steve's in a very bad mood.

- que:
  - How is dear old J.J. by the way?
  ans:
  - I see you're full of human feelings...

- que:
  - I'll by that, son. Now, you owe ME a favor. Be good to my kid sister...
  ans:
  - Right!

- que:
  - Take it easy, Susie. He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern. Would you, son?
  ans:
  - No, I wouldn't...

- que:
  - Is it news to you?
  ans:
  - Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill. Just give us the punch line...

- que:
  - Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks. Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
  ans:
  - Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?

- que:
  - Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
  ans:
  - Those \"dears\" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...

- que:
  - Why are you trembling, dear...?
  ans:
  - History repeats itself. Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...

- que:
  - Then whose fault was it, J.J.? It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - I said Sidney!...

- que:
  - I thought we were talking about Sidney?
  ans:
  - Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...

- que:
  - Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
  ans:
  - No. I'm going home.

- que:
  - Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
  ans:
  - Hello, Harry.

- que:
  - Bonna sera, commendatore. Come sta?
  ans:
  - I just checked \"downtown\". Quiet everywhere tonight.

- que:
  - Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night. Still alive?
  ans:
  - Yeah. At Bellevue. Still hanging on. But they still don't know if she was pushed.

- que:
  - You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
  ans:
  - Can I come in for a minute?

- que:
  - I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
  ans:
  - What, some cheap, gruesome gags?

- que:
  - You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
  ans:
  - You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.

- que:
  - I don't?
  ans:
  - Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...

- que:
  - Uh huh.
  ans:
  - Are you finished?

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tonight. Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.

- que:
  - You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
  ans:
  - I know Steve. No.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Get Steve back his job...please...

- que:
  - He means that much to you...?
  ans:
  - Yes. With your \"prestige\" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.

- que:
  - I got that boy coming over here. What's so funny?
  ans:
  - Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.

- que:
  - What's this boy got that Susie likes?
  ans:
  - Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

- que:
  - What does that mean - integrity?
  ans:
  - Full of beans, ain't you? But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...

- que:
  - She knows now.
  ans:
  - Are you listening?

- que:
  - Is that a fact? He's a dilly, ain't he? By the by, what did he have against this boy?
  ans:
  - He goes out with girls.

- que:
  - That's a question I usually like to ask YOU. Your secretary phoned.
  ans:
  - Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...

- que:
  - Could this be that boy?
  ans:
  - Dallas? Could be. He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...

- que:
  - And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
  ans:
  - No. It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes. Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.

- que:
  - What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
  ans:
  - Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.

- que:
  - Is Frank D'Angelo around?
  ans:
  - At the bar - Sidney...

- que:
  - Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
  ans:
  - No. That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.

- que:
  - And where was his wife?
  ans:
  - I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed. In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.

- que:
  - Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...

- que:
  - Can you be there by two-thirty?
  ans:
  - Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.

- que:
  - Back?
  ans:
  - One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.

- que:
  - Don't you know who that man is?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.

- que:
  - That's the third time he's called today.
  ans:
  - What sort of thing?

- que:
  - He wants me to break a leg?
  ans:
  - No, an arm, he said. I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.

- que:
  - Who else phoned?
  ans:
  - The renting agent and the tailor.

- que:
  - It won't leave much of a balance in the bank... Mr. Robard? Could you locate him?
  ans:
  - I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.

- que:
  - You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world?
  ans:
  - Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...

- que:
  - So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
  ans:
  - Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing...

- que:
  - Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
  ans:
  - Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!

- que:
  - Did you now? On which bounce?
  ans:
  - and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.

- que:
  - Cheers. What time is it, Al?
  ans:
  - No, I don't mind. I'm busy too.

- que:
  - You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
  ans:
  - And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?

- que:
  - Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
  ans:
  - We stick in each others craw.

- que:
  - Yes, but why?
  ans:
  - Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.

- que:
  - Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
  ans:
  - And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.

- que:
  - I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
  ans:
  - I made you write a beautiful song...

- que:
  - Why did you call me?
  ans:
  - Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...

- que:
  - What chip?
  ans:
  - They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... It's gotta be from the other one like you.

- que:
  - In the bathroom. Danny, can you get them for us?
  ans:
  - My God.

- que:
  - Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do. I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
  ans:
  - No one must follow your work.

- que:
  - Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
  ans:
  - I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.

- que:
  - This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?
  ans:
  - My mission is to protect you.

- que:
  - Yeah? Who sent you?
  ans:
  - You did. Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.

- que:
  - So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?
  ans:
  - Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Liquid metal.

- que:
  - Where we going?
  ans:
  - We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.

- que:
  - Can I stop by my house?
  ans:
  - Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I would.

- que:
  - I'm right here. I'm fine. What's the dog's name?
  ans:
  - Max.

- que:
  - I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
  ans:
  - Anything it samples by physical contact.

- que:
  - Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
  ans:
  - No. Only an object of equal size.

- que:
  - Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
  ans:
  - Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.

- que:
  - Oh, great. And what happens to her?
  ans:
  - You just can't, okay? Trust me on this.

- que:
  - Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Cool.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Does it hurt?
  ans:
  - I sense injuries. The data could be called pain.

- que:
  - How long do you live? I mean, last?
  ans:
  - A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.

- que:
  - \"Hasta la vista, baby\"?
  ans:
  - Yeah, or \"later, dickwad.\" Or if someone gets upset you say \"chill out.\" Like that. Or you can do combinations.

- que:
  - Smile?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right? Watch.

- que:
  - Not even of dying?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
  ans:
  - No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete. Then it doesn't matter.

- que:
  - Why do you cry?
  ans:
  - You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.

- que:
  - Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?! Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
  ans:
  - I'll deal with the police.

- que:
  - Is it dead?
  ans:
  - Terminated.

- que:
  - I don't trust it! These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity again.
  ans:
  - No shit?

- que:
  - I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Ready to rock?
  ans:
  - Ready.

- que:
  - I see. Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines. Now you think they don't exist?
  ans:
  - But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

- que:
  - So what do you think, Doctor? I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
  ans:
  - Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.

- que:
  - Can it be destroyed?
  ans:
  - Unknown.

- que:
  - I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
  ans:
  - Correct.

- que:
  - Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why him?
  ans:
  - In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.

- que:
  - Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
  ans:
  - And Skynet fights back.

- que:
  - Why attack Russia?
  ans:
  - Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.

- que:
  - Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?
  ans:
  - I have detailed files.

- que:
  - Is it safe for them here?
  ans:
  - Take your kids. Go to a hotel. Right now. Don't pack. Let's go.

- que:
  - Are you afraid?
  ans:
  - On Furtwngler.

- que:
  - What does he mean, too correct?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.

- que:
  - I'm Steve. What's your name?
  ans:
  - David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.

- que:
  - Sounds a lot of run. So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
  ans:
  - I guess so, sir.

- que:
  - Where you from, David?
  ans:
  - I guess you admire musicians.

- que:
  - You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
  ans:
  - I guess it's possible.

- que:
  - So, what does the Russki want?
  ans:
  - Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.

- que:
  - David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
  ans:
  - Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.

- que:
  - Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
  ans:
  - Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...

- que:
  - and totally irrelevant.
  ans:
  - David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now? Did you hear the question?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your manner.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a favour, Major?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - With more what? More what?
  ans:
  - Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.

- que:
  - David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.

- que:
  - What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
  ans:
  - Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.

- que:
  - So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
  ans:
  - But what... before that turns rotten... What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?

- que:
  - What museum?
  ans:
  - No can do.

- que:
  - You live here, in Berlin?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You do shorthand and typing?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
  ans:
  - Three months.

- que:
  - Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
  ans:
  - My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.

- que:
  - Think you can get me any of that?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.

- que:
  - I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
  ans:
  - No. Ours was damaged.

- que:
  - What's in those files?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Do you know where the Adagio begins?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What is this, Emmi?
  ans:
  - I can't do this. It's not right.

- que:
  - What's not right?
  ans:
  - I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.

- que:
  - Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
  ans:
  - I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.

- que:
  - Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
  ans:
  - I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.

- que:
  - It's the truth.
  ans:
  - How come?

- que:
  - I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
  ans:
  - I don't remember in detail, there were so many.

- que:
  - Did you call someone you knew?
  ans:
  - I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.

- que:
  - May I ask a question?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
  ans:
  - It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.

- que:
  - Why were they going to arrest you?
  ans:
  - I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.

- que:
  - So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
  ans:
  - You sure knew a lot of people in high places.

- que:
  - I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
  ans:
  - See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!

- que:
  - I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are? Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
  ans:
  - Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I wasn't told. I just knew it.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I was warned.

- que:
  - Who warned you?
  ans:
  - Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.

- que:
  - What did Goering say?
  ans:
  - He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.

- que:
  - And what was that?
  ans:
  - Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.

- que:
  - Then you are wrong.
  ans:
  - And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?

- que:
  - Von der Null?
  ans:
  - Yes, von der Null.

- que:
  - Von der Null?
  ans:
  - Yes, I know who he is.

- que:
  - That's an outrageous lie!
  ans:
  - Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.

- que:
  - And what happened to Von der Nul?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.

- que:
  - No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
  ans:
  - Those attitudes do not exist in me.

- que:
  - Do you know what that is?
  ans:
  - Of course I know what that is.

- que:
  - Okay, so what is it?
  ans:
  - Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.

- que:
  - Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
  ans:
  - It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.

- que:
  - Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
  ans:
  - I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.

- que:
  - Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
  ans:
  - Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.

- que:
  - Do I know Hans Hinkel?
  ans:
  - That's what I asked.

- que:
  - I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
  ans:
  - Do I know Hans Hinkel?

- que:
  - How could I know what's in the archive?
  ans:
  - Major.

- que:
  - Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
  ans:
  - It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.

- que:
  - How could I forget?
  ans:
  - Show me.

- que:
  - Show you?
  ans:
  - Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...

- que:
  - I've remembered something else...
  ans:
  - Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.

- que:
  - He did?
  ans:
  - One of your people told me.

- que:
  - One of my people?
  ans:
  - Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.

- que:
  - But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
  ans:
  - There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.

- que:
  - Never heard of him, who is he?
  ans:
  - Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.

- que:
  - Who's he?
  ans:
  - The Miracle Kid.

- que:
  - His private life?
  ans:
  - But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.

- que:
  - Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you mean, Major.

- que:
  - Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - They said I was dogged?
  ans:
  - Like this bandleader.

- que:
  - Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
  ans:
  - First oboe.

- que:
  - He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
  ans:
  - Brave? To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.

- que:
  - Yes, Chuck?
  ans:
  - Come to the office, please.

- que:
  - Not really. Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.

- que:
  - Thanks, Chuck. I need the money. Can I still work the hours around my classes?
  ans:
  - It's not brain surgery, Chuck.

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...

- que:
  - Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
  ans:
  - All.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Not lately. Did you check messages?
  ans:
  - I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'. You and Matt have a good time.

- que:
  - What's it to ya?
  ans:
  - You must have a girlfriend.

- que:
  - Do you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes. Don't hurt me.

- que:
  - So, it's from the future, is that right?
  ans:
  - One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.

- que:
  - And you're from the future too?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.

- que:
  - You cold?
  ans:
  - Freezing.

- que:
  - Reese...you got a first name?
  ans:
  - Kyle.

- que:
  - Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
  ans:
  - White light. Pain. Like being ripped inside out... slowly. Like being born, maybe.

- que:
  - Caught one? You mean you got shot?
  ans:
  - We gotta get you to a doctor.

- que:
  - What's he like?
  ans:
  - You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.

- que:
  - Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So...it was John that ordered you here?
  ans:
  - I volunteered.

- que:
  - You volunteered?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
  ans:
  - You'll learn.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About where you're from.

- que:
  - Bag some Z's?
  ans:
  - Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - That's where we're going.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...

- que:
  - Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right?
  ans:
  - I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...

- que:
  - Is this enough?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid.

- que:
  - Hot dogs?
  ans:
  - My whole life has been combat.

- que:
  - He'll find us, won't he?
  ans:
  - Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...

- que:
  - Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
  ans:
  - Good fighters.

- que:
  - Someone?
  ans:
  - A girl. You know.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - You'll beg for mercy in a second.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Cover...our footsteps...

- que:
  - And who was the enemy?
  ans:
  - SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series 4800.

- que:
  - Then how are you supposed to get back?
  ans:
  - Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I didn't build the fucking thing.

- que:
  - You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid that's not up to me.

- que:
  - Who is in authority here?
  ans:
  - ...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...

- que:
  - I won't. Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I don't want to leave. I think this guy's following me.

- que:
  - I guess so. You're a doctor?
  ans:
  - Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep. It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.

- que:
  - Did you reach the next girl yet?
  ans:
  - No. Keep getting an answer- ing machine.

- que:
  - I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases. Where you going?
  ans:
  - To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name. Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.

- que:
  - If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us. How do I look?
  ans:
  - Like shit, boss.

- que:
  - Will you really hold me to it over pennies?
  ans:
  - My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.

- que:
  - It probably will. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time. Why should I settle for that?
  ans:
  - Because it's fair. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares...

- que:
  - Your father was a friend. Goddamn it... I watched you grow up. How do you end up treating me like this?
  ans:
  - Now, look...

- que:
  - Are you finished?
  ans:
  - No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet.

- que:
  - Did you play recently?
  ans:
  - Hm? No, about a year ago. I was working out of Los Angeles.

- que:
  - Pardon me... Miss... ?
  ans:
  - Oh, no... you.

- que:
  - I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this?
  ans:
  - What's going on? I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.

- que:
  - What's with him?
  ans:
  - I don't know... he fell.

- que:
  - Do you know what to do?
  ans:
  - I don't think he's breathing.

- que:
  - What is your problem?
  ans:
  - Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner. I get a note...

- que:
  - What... is... happening... ?
  ans:
  - I was trying to tell you... it's a game.

- que:
  - A game?
  ans:
  - It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks. Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...

- que:
  - You mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself... ?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, about this...

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Home.

- que:
  - Where'd you all go? Motherfucking frat boys. You better hide. Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
  ans:
  - It was a gift... from my brother.

- que:
  - \"... wait for help.\" Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
  ans:
  - I'll give you a boost.

- que:
  - This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
  ans:
  - You pull me up.

- que:
  - What's C.R.S.?
  ans:
  - Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They...

- que:
  - Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
  ans:
  - That one did.

- que:
  - Nicholas Van Orton? What are you, a czar?
  ans:
  - That's classic.

- que:
  - Why... ?
  ans:
  - We hang down here and drop. The garbage'll break our fall.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - That tall, bright building. Near there.

- que:
  - What exactly do you do?
  ans:
  - Investment banking. Moving money from place to place.

- que:
  - Can we talk?
  ans:
  - It's okay, dad.

- que:
  - I think I would remember. What makes you think it's me?
  ans:
  - Well... the red bra.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I sit?
  ans:
  - Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you're in...

- que:
  - Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel?
  ans:
  - Take the picture out.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.

- que:
  - Wha... ?
  ans:
  - Not here! They can see.

- que:
  - What are you doing... ?
  ans:
  - Get out.

- que:
  - Then, what good are you?
  ans:
  - I know things... like who you can trust. Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.

- que:
  - How? How could they have gotten anything?
  ans:
  - They did the same to him as they did to you.

- que:
  - Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
  ans:
  - Overseas operator? Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I didn't say anything.

- que:
  - Who the fuck cares?
  ans:
  - It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.

- que:
  - Scams, con games. How many?
  ans:
  - I don't know. A lot.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - What do you mean? I checked them myself. I made the calls...

- que:
  - What... what do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's out of your hands.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic...

- que:
  - Where'd you get that gun?
  ans:
  - It's mine...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...

- que:
  - I have to get to the airport...
  ans:
  - No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?

- que:
  - Where are you going in such a hurry?
  ans:
  - There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia. I'm just a walk-on this time though. Bit-part.

- que:
  - What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be... ?
  ans:
  - Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.

- que:
  - Like... where are you from?
  ans:
  - Originally, Connecticut.

- que:
  - Big family... small?
  ans:
  - One brother, one sister.

- que:
  - Studied acting, I assume?
  ans:
  - Julliard, yeah.

- que:
  - Single?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Boyfriend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Underwear?
  ans:
  - Always.

- que:
  - That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
  ans:
  - They gave me a free jacket at the door.

- que:
  - Which grad-school?
  ans:
  - You look good.

- que:
  - How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you?
  ans:
  - Never better.

- que:
  - Elizabeth?
  ans:
  - Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.

- que:
  - Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You need anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - For you.

- que:
  - \"Consumer Recrreation Services.\" What, do they make golf clubs?
  ans:
  - Trust me. Call that number.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - They make your life fun. Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.

- que:
  - Fun?
  ans:
  - You've heard of it. You've seen other people having it. They're an entertainment service, but more than that.

- que:
  - This isn't an escort service?
  ans:
  - It's a profound life experience.

- que:
  - Like a stroke?
  ans:
  - Call them. Trust me.

- que:
  - Will you?
  ans:
  - I said I would...

- que:
  - Why would you say that?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd like this. Best thing I ever did. If you don't want to do it, DON'T...

- que:
  - I'll call them, okay?
  ans:
  - Shhhhhhh. Wait... wait...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - C.R.S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into.

- que:
  - How do you mean, exactly?
  ans:
  - They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the real fucking begins.

- que:
  - What have they been doing to you?
  ans:
  - Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata...

- que:
  - Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
  ans:
  - You think I know? I paid them more to make it stop.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself.

- que:
  - Do you know how to change a tire?
  ans:
  - No. Do you? Can't be too hard, can it? I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.

- que:
  - How did those... ?
  ans:
  - Stop this. It's not true...

- que:
  - You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - This... ? Oh, this is just... this is the bill.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Split it?
  ans:
  - Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.

- que:
  - No money, no identification or passport. You are in a fix. What did happen to you?
  ans:
  - Well, where to begin. It's complicated...

- que:
  - Robbed?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Have you gone to the police?
  ans:
  - I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that.

- que:
  - We'll help with the police, if you want to bother. As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion? You say you were mugged?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And, they didn't take that watch?
  ans:
  - How much is it? A few thousand, at least. A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.

- que:
  - Of course you can have it if you need it. Can I get you something to eat?
  ans:
  - There's nothing to forgive.

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - What's all this for?
  ans:
  - We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...

- que:
  - No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
  ans:
  - Oh... it's a game.

- que:
  - A game?
  ans:
  - Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.

- que:
  - What kind of vacation?
  ans:
  - It's different every time.

- que:
  - How long will these take?
  ans:
  - An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.

- que:
  - Physical?
  ans:
  - Cursory examination. Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing. You'll be out of here in no time.

- que:
  - You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
  ans:
  - How do I find them? Their offices are empty.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.

- que:
  - Where'd you pick up your checks?
  ans:
  - It was a different floor then...

- que:
  - Have we met?
  ans:
  - Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.

- que:
  - Didn't I give you two?
  ans:
  - No, you didn't...

- que:
  - You did? How is he?
  ans:
  - Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.

- que:
  - Is everything alright?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. Goodnight.

- que:
  - I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened?
  ans:
  - There's been a break in. Lock this door and stay here. Don't move a muscle.

- que:
  - What makes you ask?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Did you worry about him?
  ans:
  - Nobody worried about your father.

- que:
  - What's the trouble?
  ans:
  - You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...

- que:
  - What's this about?
  ans:
  - It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...

- que:
  - Where's my brother?
  ans:
  - There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room. We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.

- que:
  - His behavior... ?
  ans:
  - He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit...

- que:
  - I'll send your regrets. Honestly, why must I even bother?
  ans:
  - Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...

- que:
  - What gentleman, Maria?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving...

- que:
  - Is Alan Baer \"the Game?\" Is that what this is?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Nothing at all.

- que:
  - How concerned should I be?
  ans:
  - It was a misunderstanding.

- que:
  - Someone's playing hardball. It's complicated. Can I ask a favor?
  ans:
  - You know you can.

- que:
  - Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
  ans:
  - Just what I told you.

- que:
  - Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
  ans:
  - You're joking.

- que:
  - What about the house?
  ans:
  - Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Every year is a good year.

- que:
  - And what kind of sleeper?
  ans:
  - Well, I... uh...

- que:
  - Who's Watts?
  ans:
  - The children. The children Hugh Crain built the house for. The children he never had.

- que:
  - Couldn't get the last ones. You?
  ans:
  - I did okay.

- que:
  - Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this?
  ans:
  - It's somebody's idea of a joke.

- que:
  - Is this true? I've been hypnotized?
  ans:
  - And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.

- que:
  - So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
  ans:
  - That could have been worse.

- que:
  - Luke, can I talk to you?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I've read your tests.

- que:
  - Do we still get paid for the week?
  ans:
  - You get your money.

- que:
  - Is that the question of compassion or science?
  ans:
  - It's a question.

- que:
  - So could you! Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
  ans:
  - We're fucked. We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.

- que:
  - You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
  ans:
  - That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.

- que:
  - All night?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You want company?
  ans:
  - Was sure she'd be in here.

- que:
  - Are you working with her?
  ans:
  - Mary, I'll meet you outside.

- que:
  - Does she know that's why you're using her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Eleanor, how was the drive?
  ans:
  - You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.

- que:
  - How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? Water hammer, something like that?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Nell! What's wrong?
  ans:
  - That smell... oh, God.

- que:
  - What did it smell like?
  ans:
  - It was very specific.

- que:
  - What happened after you smelled it?
  ans:
  - I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.

- que:
  - Like she smelled it too?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And then what happened?
  ans:
  - I got more scared.

- que:
  - Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What is that tune?
  ans:
  - Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...

- que:
  - Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
  ans:
  - It's not real? Crain? He's not real?

- que:
  - Then who called me?
  ans:
  - Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please.

- que:
  - You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
  ans:
  - You hear the vibrations in the wire. There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. I could test it.

- que:
  - How'd I know it was for you?
  ans:
  - Because it's my phone. Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. See you soon. Thank you.

- que:
  - What's this? What's this... this picture?
  ans:
  - That? That's Hill House.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - There were no children. Rene died, and then Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.

- que:
  - Have either of you seen David Watts?
  ans:
  - No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.

- que:
  - When do we take the tests?
  ans:
  - Every day. Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.

- que:
  - Is she asleep?
  ans:
  - I'm a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Oh! You scared me.

- que:
  - Is there something about the house?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Rene Crain. Up there. Rope. Ship's hawser. Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.

- que:
  - Why'd she kill herself?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Can't say. Haven't been here that long. Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.

- que:
  - They're so beautiful. Aren't they?
  ans:
  - I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.

- que:
  - What did it cost?
  ans:
  - Fifteen dollars.

- que:
  - Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you mean.

- que:
  - I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you?
  ans:
  - That depends.

- que:
  - A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
  ans:
  - Jeez.

- que:
  - You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Yes. I've missed it.

- que:
  - Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
  ans:
  - I guess. Oh, your hair! It looks good.

- que:
  - How could he have left without his keys?
  ans:
  - Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his.

- que:
  - Is it over?
  ans:
  - No, it's getting worse.

- que:
  - Theo... Did you?
  ans:
  - Maybe you did it yourself.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. Maybe he did it...

- que:
  - Just think about one thing right now, What color?
  ans:
  - I've never had a pedicure before.

- que:
  - Red. What else?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

- que:
  - I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
  ans:
  - I have a loft.

- que:
  - You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
  ans:
  - I don't know, you know...

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Because I don't want to ruin things. Because home is where the heart is.

- que:
  - What'd you come back for, babe?
  ans:
  - Just had to be sure.

- que:
  - Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
  ans:
  - I want that scary guy in your house.

- que:
  - Is that a problem?
  ans:
  - Not for you, clearly.

- que:
  - Am I a thing?
  ans:
  - Well, you're certainly not a person.

- que:
  - It's an observation. Like, I'm hungry. When are we eating?
  ans:
  - As soon as you get dressed.

- que:
  - What kind of food?
  ans:
  - Anything but Japanese.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.

- que:
  - Italian?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Not who, food. Should we get Italian.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.

- que:
  - We think?
  ans:
  - We can't find ... ... two of our guys.

- que:
  - Come over here.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - How they goin', kid?
  ans:
  - Not bad.

- que:
  - How'd you like to kill someone for me?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Where do we go?
  ans:
  - When you find the guy, you'll know.

- que:
  - Our black friends?
  ans:
  - No, Terry. They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.

- que:
  - You think I'm staying?
  ans:
  - There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.

- que:
  - Oh really? Where you from?
  ans:
  - England. Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.

- que:
  - You came to the right place, sir. My wife's second cousin is English. Well, Scotch-Irish. Can I interest you in a holster?
  ans:
  - Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - No problem. If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.

- que:
  - What'd you call that -- the Protector?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. Won't find a better CQC on the market.

- que:
  - CQ what?
  ans:
  - Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my own home.

- que:
  - Edward Rama?
  ans:
  - Eduardo. Rama.

- que:
  - I mean, what has it been -- six months?
  ans:
  - Round about, yeah.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Snuffed her.

- que:
  - Valentine. What's he got to say for himself?
  ans:
  - What more is there.

- que:
  - This ain't your lot?
  ans:
  - You kiddin', man? I don't need a wife and screamin' kids. I still got my youth.

- que:
  - What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
  ans:
  - That's what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.

- que:
  - What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops?
  ans:
  - Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

- que:
  - Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
  ans:
  - Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.

- que:
  - What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
  ans:
  - These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.

- que:
  - Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a three-day waiting period?
  ans:
  - Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.

- que:
  - No. Not at all. Do we?
  ans:
  - Not me, man.

- que:
  - I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
  ans:
  - You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.

- que:
  - It's only insurance. Can't be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long?
  ans:
  - Five years, I think. Long time.

- que:
  - How'd the two of you hook up, then?
  ans:
  - Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.

- que:
  - Who'd you butcher at the house?
  ans:
  - Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - He's brought in the heavy mob.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Extra muscle. Bodyguards.

- que:
  - Has he?
  ans:
  - They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry. Watch it.

- que:
  - That was one of them?
  ans:
  - See what I mean? Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.

- que:
  - What's so fucking funny?
  ans:
  - Those aren't guards. They're valets.

- que:
  - Valets. What d'ya mean valets. What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
  ans:
  - Valets. They park cars. He's having a party.

- que:
  - What are we standing on?
  ans:
  - Faith.

- que:
  - You goin' back inside?
  ans:
  - One thing I need.

- que:
  - Too easy?
  ans:
  - He's gotta know why.

- que:
  - You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will? What more do you want, man?
  ans:
  - I've been wondering something.

- que:
  - Do you have any friends, man?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I suppose. Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night. Meet some of the lads.

- que:
  - Not much -- you?
  ans:
  - Same.

- que:
  - Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - You just cooking then?
  ans:
  - Hell, no. I started writing.

- que:
  - Hey, Elaine. You even know what he's saying half the time?
  ans:
  - No, but I know what he means.

- que:
  - No, why did you come here?
  ans:
  - Sort a few things out.

- que:
  - How d'you mean?
  ans:
  - It's been a while.

- que:
  - In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
  ans:
  - What was that, then?

- que:
  - Here, are you always this sarky?
  ans:
  - Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go.

- que:
  - If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that -- Eddie?
  ans:
  - Said it went on for donkey's years.

- que:
  - Now who's being sarcastic?
  ans:
  - When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.

- que:
  - When did you get in?
  ans:
  - Yesterday. Afternoon.

- que:
  - The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
  ans:
  - Nah, accommodation address.

  - Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
  ans:
  - -- Mr. Lindgren.

- que:
  - Who's Mr. Lindgren?
  ans:
  - My employer.

- que:
  - In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
  ans:
  - This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.

- que:
  - And how did you get it?
  ans:
  - Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.

- que:
  - These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
  ans:
  - You don't seem bothered.

- que:
  - Hey?
  ans:
  - From pursuing your chosen profession.

- que:
  - Did you. What was that in aid of?
  ans:
  - Who remembers.

- que:
  - You have been away. Or is all this just new to you?
  ans:
  - It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.

- que:
  - You ever been to London?
  ans:
  - Only in the movies.

- que:
  - What about your grandmother?
  ans:
  - Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.

- que:
  - What'd your father do?
  ans:
  - Black market during the war.

- que:
  - Won't he be looking for you about now?
  ans:
  - Good luck to him. He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.

- que:
  - Do us a favor. Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
  ans:
  - I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.

- que:
  - Where's Big Sur?
  ans:
  - Up the coast.

- que:
  - How far?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- few hours, I guess.

- que:
  - Fancy it?
  ans:
  - I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.

- que:
  - What's in Big Sur?
  ans:
  - That's where Valentine's scarpered.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Bloke told me.

- que:
  - So what's your beef, pal?
  ans:
  - It was you. Downtown.

- que:
  - Eh?
  ans:
  - No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.

- que:
  - All of what?
  ans:
  - Of the deal, man.

- que:
  - What am I doing?
  ans:
  - Valentine had himself a party, I hear.

- que:
  - Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown? There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead. Any of this ring a bell?
  ans:
  - My client is an entrepreneur. I am his lawyer, not his business manager.

- que:
  - Where is he now?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Unless I'm not who I think I am.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.

- que:
  - What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
  ans:
  - Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that.

- que:
  - Where else?
  ans:
  - Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years.

- que:
  - Nine years? Is that legal?
  ans:
  - But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.

- que:
  - Makin' trouble for someone?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Which kind?
  ans:
  - The forever kind.

  ans:
  - It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.

- que:
  - ...I stank, didn't I?
  ans:
  - He didn't say that.

- que:
  - I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?

  ans:
  - Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.

- que:
  - Huh.
  ans:
  - A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?

- que:
  - ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
  ans:
  - Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.

- que:
  - I can get it, yeah.

- que:
  - ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
  ans:
  - Mm.

  ans:
  - I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.

  - Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?

  - He said OK. Is that what he said?
  ans:
  - Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
  ans:
  - Someone broke into this room.

- que:
  - Anything missin'?
  ans:
  - Doesn't look like it. We're damned lucky. This statue is priceless.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out. That lock was torn off from the inside.

- que:
  - Do they have to wear uniforms?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where's the walk-in safe?
  ans:
  - Behind you.

- que:
  - What's the combination?
  ans:
  - I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.

- que:
  - The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
  ans:
  - Fifteen... what's next?

- que:
  - Where the hell are you?
  ans:
  - I made it outside. I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight.

- que:
  - Who are you? The undertaker?
  ans:
  - Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.

- que:
  - Vince D'Agosta. Am I out?
  ans:
  - Not at all. I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help.

- que:
  - The body?
  ans:
  - What's left of it.

- que:
  - Mind if I have a look?
  ans:
  - We need light in here, stat.

- que:
  - Where's the head?
  ans:
  - Careful. That mess on the ground is brains.

- que:
  - Whose footprints?
  ans:
  - Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect.

- que:
  - I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind?
  ans:
  - Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.

- que:
  - So the method of death is the only connection?
  ans:
  - No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.

- que:
  - How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
  ans:
  - They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch.

- que:
  - You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
  ans:
  - No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.

- que:
  - What happened to them?
  ans:
  - If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.

- que:
  - Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
  ans:
  - Correct.

- que:
  - How big is the sub-basement?
  ans:
  - Apparently it's huge.

- que:
  - The sub-basement?
  ans:
  - I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out.

- que:
  - Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
  ans:
  - Lieutenant! It's me.

- que:
  - I know.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
  ans:
  - You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.

- que:
  - What does it say?
  ans:
  - Dr. John Whittlesley.

- que:
  - What's that doing here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.

- que:
  - Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - I'd say we're in its home.

- que:
  - What are we talking about here?
  ans:
  - Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

- que:
  - Right. The entire brain appears to have been extracted. May I see it, please?
  ans:
  - Curious. There's something missing.

- que:
  - The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
  ans:
  - Yes. Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - They're eggs.

- que:
  - Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?
  ans:
  - Don't stop now.

- que:
  - Dr. Frock?
  ans:
  - Look who's here, Margo.

- que:
  - Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
  ans:
  - Yes. John made quite a study of the whole museum. He had a copy of my original plans.

- que:
  - Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
  ans:
  - Not really. Just the sub-basement.

- que:
  - Where is that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years.

- que:
  - You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please?
  ans:
  - We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.

- que:
  - Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
  ans:
  - They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.

- que:
  - You work here?
  ans:
  - Yes, I do.

- que:
  - Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
  ans:
  - He's right. Follow me.

- que:
  - It's alright. I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. What is this place?
  ans:
  - Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer.

- que:
  - Jesus, what is this?
  ans:
  - Another storage room.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Frock's been fired.

- que:
  - For once I'm glad you're rumor central. What in the world is going on?
  ans:
  - Someone's been murdered. Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either. Torn limb from limb. There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.

- que:
  - What do you make of it, Margo?
  ans:
  - It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.

- que:
  - What kind of egg is it?
  ans:
  - Is Dr. Frock safe!

- que:
  - How about lunch?
  ans:
  - Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.

- que:
  - How does it work?
  ans:
  - No. I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.

- que:
  - Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead?
  ans:
  - Maybe not.

- que:
  - And John?
  ans:
  - Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.

- que:
  - How did you know that?
  ans:
  - That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone.

- que:
  - Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
  ans:
  - A legendary monster called Mbwun.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.

- que:
  - What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. But I've never seen it. It's in the exhibit.

- que:
  - Where would we find it?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where did you see it?
  ans:
  - Behind me. Over there.

- que:
  - I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?
  ans:
  - They're all heavily armed.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw.

- que:
  - Genetic damage?
  ans:
  - We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.

- que:
  - Pendergast? Are you all right?
  ans:
  - No. I think I'm hallucinating.

- que:
  - You're not. Where is it?
  ans:
  - Gone.

- que:
  - Wounded?
  ans:
  - It's scared of me.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.

- que:
  - It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
  ans:
  - I think... it means it's full.

- que:
  - Then it won't go after the others?
  ans:
  - No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.

- que:
  - I'm sorry to keep you. How can I help?
  ans:
  - I want to book a flight to Fiji.

- que:
  - Where in Fiji? What island?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.

- que:
  - Viti Levu. For how many?
  ans:
  - One.

- que:
  - When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
  ans:
  - Today.

- que:
  - Why wouldn't I?
  ans:
  - I thought you were in a hurry.

- que:
  - You want to book the flight?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter. I'll make other arrangements.

- que:
  - Close up?
  ans:
  - No, hold back...

- que:
  - Why is he in the basement?
  ans:
  - He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.

- que:
  - What happened down there?
  ans:
  - He was tidying up his garbage. I was going to call you. But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.

- que:
  - All prop cars accounted for?
  ans:
  - He has to be on foot. He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.

- que:
  - What have we missed?
  ans:
  - It's just a matter of time.

- que:
  - What music?
  ans:
  - Storm music...Wagner...

- que:
  - How do you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
  ans:
  - Amnesia.

- que:
  - A window onto the human condition?
  ans:
  - I prefer to think of it as a mirror.

- que:
  - We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
  ans:
  - Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

- que:
  - Are we talking Emmies?
  ans:
  - Certainly a nomination.

- que:
  - You've never actually met Truman, yourself. Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
  ans:
  - I'm the creator.

- que:
  - The creator of what?
  ans:
  - A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.

- que:
  - A show. Then who am I?
  ans:
  - You're the star.

- que:
  - What's he doing?
  ans:
  - They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.

- que:
  - But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
  ans:
  - Because his mother got sick - very sick. He couldn't leave her. He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.

- que:
  - How can they have a child?
  ans:
  - It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

- que:
  - You think she'd go through with it?
  ans:
  - Sure she would.

- que:
  - Lauren, right?
  ans:
  - That's right. Lauren.

- que:
  - No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Saturday?
  ans:
  - Actually, I'm free Sunday.

- que:
  - Well, what do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I think I've studied enough.

- que:
  - It's beautiful! What are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - I...I can't.

- que:
  - Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...out!
  ans:
  - Yeah? Outta what?

- que:
  - Nursery?
  ans:
  - Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Trust me.

- que:
  - Sure. It's halogen. Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued. You coming for a drink?
  ans:
  - I've got to talk to you.

- que:
  - Mixed up? Mixed up in what?
  ans:
  - No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.

- que:
  - How about them?
  ans:
  - I told you I can't.

- que:
  - What're we doing here, Truman?
  ans:
  - This is where it started.

- que:
  - What exactly?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
  ans:
  - I went all over but I never found a place like this. Look at that sunset, Truman. It's perfect.

- que:
  - I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - The thing that started all of this.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It's a surprise.

- que:
  - Well, what do you think?
  ans:
  - They're... perfect. Thank you.

- que:
  - How did it go today?
  ans:
  - A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw. We got three of his fingers back on.

- que:
  - Maybe I feel like a teenager.
  ans:
  - Did something happen today?

- que:
  - We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
  ans:
  - It'd be an adventure.

- que:
  - I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
  ans:
  - That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.

- que:
  - What're you doing down here?
  ans:
  - Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.

- que:
  - What did you want?
  ans:
  - I made macaroni.

- que:
  - Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough?
  ans:
  - I still want to look over a couple of things.

- que:
  - I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
  ans:
  - Good night, Mother.

- que:
  - What's the hurry?
  ans:
  - Arrah!

- que:
  - You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?
  ans:
  - You hate gambling.

- que:
  - Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.

- que:
  - I think I'd like a little company.
  ans:
  - Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?

- que:
  - It's hard to go places, isn't it?
  ans:
  - There's been an accident, Truman.

- que:
  - Truman, what about that sign?
  ans:
  - I'm sure they're just exaggerating.

- que:
  - So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
  ans:
  - Well, I made it through another night.

- que:
  - How's your hip?
  ans:
  - Oh, just so.

- que:
  - I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
  ans:
  - We ought to be getting you back, Mother.

- que:
  - Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
  ans:
  - I'll try.

- que:
  - When you get to Fiji?
  ans:
  - You got it.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.

- que:
  - Is there any way around?
  ans:
  - The whole area's being evacuated.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - --It doesn't matter. Everybody knows about it. They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.

- que:
  - How's it going, Truman?
  ans:
  - Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.

- que:
  - Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
  ans:
  - I'd ask for identification.

- que:
  - Do you live around here?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
  ans:
  - I think you better tell us.

- que:
  - Poopy day?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I think that about does it, Spooky.

- que:
  - Sorry. Don't have one.
  ans:
  - Does what?

- que:
  - What am I doing here?
  ans:
  - You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.

- que:
  - I need your clothes, Byers.
  ans:
  - When was that?

- que:
  - You've been back to Dallas?
  ans:
  - Agent Mulder.

- que:
  - What is it you find incredible?
  ans:
  - No, they don't.

- que:
  - MAN Brought on by what?
  ans:
  - MAN This man's still alive.

- que:
  - MAN How can this be?
  ans:
  - The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.

- que:
  - Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
  ans:
  - MAN No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.

- que:
  - And if it's unsuccessful?
  ans:
  - MAN Incinerate it. Like the others.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who called this meeting?
  ans:
  - MAN Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.

- que:
  - Into what?
  ans:
  - My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.

- que:
  - Do they know?
  ans:
  - MAN Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - MAN Kurtzweil, we think.

- que:
  - You got some kind of business with him?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for him.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.

- que:
  - You looking for him for some other reason?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.

- que:
  - You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
  ans:
  - No. Don't bother.

- que:
  - Have you examined them?
  ans:
  - No. Just fossils, far as I know.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.

- que:
  - You follow me out here for a reason?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I did.

- que:
  - I know the name. Why?
  ans:
  - Old friend of your father's.

- que:
  - How'd you find me?
  ans:
  - Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.

- que:
  - You a reporter?
  ans:
  - I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.

- que:
  - Who sent you?
  ans:
  - I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.

- que:
  - What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
  ans:
  - The Federal Building was too well guarded.

- que:
  - Before the bomb went off?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm saying.

- que:
  - You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
  ans:
  - And one little boy.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.

- que:
  - They want to discredit you -- for what?
  ans:
  - For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.

- que:
  - I don't either, but it sure sells books.
  ans:
  - You know my work?

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.

- que:
  - You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
  ans:
  - It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.

- que:
  - What killed those men?
  ans:
  - What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.

- que:
  - Negotiating with whom?
  ans:
  - And they tell me I'm paranoid.

- que:
  - How can I reach you?
  ans:
  - You can't.

- que:
  - You found something?
  ans:
  - Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.

- que:
  - Your guess?
  ans:
  - I'm on the roof.

- que:
  - Did you find something?
  ans:
  - No. I haven't.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Scully?
  ans:
  - Jesus, Mulder...

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.

- que:
  - It's locked?
  ans:
  - Had you.

- que:
  - Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
  ans:
  - I just did. You're buying.

- que:
  - Alright... what'll it be, Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
  ans:
  - Something sweet.

- que:
  - Where are you, Mulder?
  ans:
  - I'm in the vending room.

- que:
  - Scully?
  ans:
  - Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.

- que:
  - What? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.

- que:
  - You're... quitting?
  ans:
  - There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.

- que:
  - I wake you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you drunk, Mulder?
  ans:
  - I was until about an hour ago.

- que:
  - What are you implying, Scully?
  ans:
  - I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.

- que:
  - Is that what you'd like me to do?
  ans:
  - Go home, Mulder. It's late.

- que:
  - Mulder -- what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.

- que:
  - This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
  ans:
  - According to this tag.

- que:
  - And you're looking for?
  ans:
  - It's like jelly.

- que:
  - You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.

- que:
  - Why are you whispering?
  ans:
  - I can't really talk right now.

- que:
  - What did you find?
  ans:
  - Evidence of a massive infection.

- que:
  - How was it contracted?
  ans:
  - He didn't mention a park.

- que:
  - You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
  ans:
  - The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.

- que:
  - This looks like new grass to you?
  ans:
  - It looks pretty green for this climate.

- que:
  - Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Mulder.

- que:
  - And where are they going with it?
  ans:
  - That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.

- que:
  - What are my choices?
  ans:
  - About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.

- que:
  - Where would they be going?
  ans:
  - We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.

- que:
  - You think they went left?
  ans:
  - I don't know why I think they went right.

- que:
  - Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
  ans:
  - This is great. This is fitting.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --

- que:
  - What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
  ans:
  - This virus -- it...

- que:
  - What do you think it is?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
  ans:
  - Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.

- que:
  - You hear that?
  ans:
  - I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.

- que:
  - Yeah...?
  ans:
  - Run.

- que:
  - Where'd they go?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.

- que:
  - What? What happened?
  ans:
  - I think... something stung me.

- que:
  - Where are we?
  ans:
  - You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.

- que:
  - On whose orders?
  ans:
  - GUARD General McAddie's.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - -- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.

- que:
  - Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
  ans:
  - And they want to blame us?

- que:
  - How deep does this go?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Are we being watched?
  ans:
  - I'm not taking any chances.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I've got to find Scully.

- que:
  - What happened to Kurtzweil?
  ans:
  - He's come and gone.

- que:
  - Where's Scully?
  ans:
  - I have answers for you.

- que:
  - Is she alive?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - About the conspiracy?
  ans:
  - I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.

- que:
  - This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
  ans:
  - No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.

- que:
  - What do you mean, walked?
  ans:
  - Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.

- que:
  - Why are you telling me this?
  ans:
  - I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.

- que:
  - What happened to Kurtzweil?
  ans:
  - As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.

- que:
  - What alien environment?
  ans:
  - Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - My life is over. Go.

- que:
  - More concerns than that?
  ans:
  - We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.

- que:
  - We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
  ans:
  - No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.

- que:
  - And Mulder?
  ans:
  - You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.

- que:
  - Did we go sailing?
  ans:
  - Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.

- que:
  - Lucien Baines?
  ans:
  - She adores you.

- que:
  - Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
  ans:
  - I don't want to find out.

- que:
  - You're sure? Any more nightmares?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come?
  ans:
  - I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.

- que:
  - A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened?
  ans:
  - Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - ...a pocketful of rye.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him.

- que:
  - What if he wasn't like this? What if he was \"normal?\" Conscious. How far would you go?
  ans:
  - As far as I needed.

- que:
  - How hard could it be...?
  ans:
  - This man is deeply disturbed, he...

- que:
  - No. Not at all. From what I understand, he knows I\"m here, isn't that right?
  ans:
  - It doesn't have much to do with science.

- que:
  - What then?
  ans:
  - The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.

- que:
  - Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. I suppose everyone does.

- que:
  - That's what therapists are for, right?
  ans:
  - With Stargher I saw things...

- que:
  - Why'd you bring him here?
  ans:
  - You're the shrink, you tell me.

- que:
  - You think you can do this, don't you?
  ans:
  - He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.

- que:
  - Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
  ans:
  - Evil.

- que:
  - What difference does it make...?
  ans:
  - Tell me.

- que:
  - You're sure of that?
  ans:
  - Yes. I am.

- que:
  - Where the hell are we?
  ans:
  - Carl, do you know? Like on a map...

- que:
  - You sure about this?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. Abigail...

- que:
  - He's mine?
  ans:
  - All yours. My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.

- que:
  - You liked him?
  ans:
  - He's beautiful...

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - s broken.

- que:
  - Who says?
  ans:
  - Mocky-Lock.

- que:
  - She the one from Santa Cruz?
  ans:
  - Just graduated law school. Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.

- que:
  - Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
  ans:
  - You're kidding me.

- que:
  - Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
  ans:
  - They took care of that, thank you, Henry.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.

- que:
  - When did he lapse into the coma?
  ans:
  - Sometime yesterday morning.

- que:
  - What about the legalities of this...?
  ans:
  - Catherine!

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
  ans:
  - Prevacid. For my stomach.

- que:
  - Any psychiatric medication?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about narcotics?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is she alright?
  ans:
  - Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to...

- que:
  - What about the cat?
  ans:
  - Completely unaware.

- que:
  - Someone looking after her little girl?
  ans:
  - Grandparents. Live over in Davis.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Now.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - Pregnant. Thanks for asking.

- que:
  - After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
  ans:
  - She remembers because it was her \"dream truck.\" Wanted one just like it.

- que:
  - No. Can you get a man close?
  ans:
  - I don't have to.

- que:
  - Next time, tell me, okay?
  ans:
  - But you looked so cute. All sleepy...

- que:
  - You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
  ans:
  - I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.

- que:
  - Do you understand German?
  ans:
  - No, no...oh...excuse me.

- que:
  - No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
  ans:
  - Well, I saw you at the funeral.

- que:
  - You were in love with him, weren't you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.

- que:
  - I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
  ans:
  - The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.

- que:
  - His own doctor?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Were you at the inquest?
  ans:
  - Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.

- que:
  - He was Harry's driver?
  ans:
  - Mmmm.

- que:
  - What's she talking about?
  ans:
  - The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.

- que:
  - Anything really wrong with your papers?
  ans:
  - They're forged.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.

- que:
  - Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
  ans:
  - Dr. Winkel.

- que:
  - Drink?
  ans:
  - Whiskey.

- que:
  - Who are you looking for now?
  ans:
  - Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.

- que:
  - Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
  ans:
  - Just another part I've got to learn.

- que:
  - I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
  ans:
  - Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - \"Ein hurigan\" - I guess.

- que:
  - When...what did you do?
  ans:
  - Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Oh, that was many years ago.

- que:
  - What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
  ans:
  - I thought you wanted...

- que:
  - That's Harry's place, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Let's not get into any more trouble.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I wish I knew.

- que:
  - Wer ist da?
  ans:
  - Me.

- que:
  - I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - A parrot...Let it go.

- que:
  - Have you?
  ans:
  - ...you know.

- que:
  - He told you, didn't he?
  ans:
  - He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.

- que:
  - Are you going, too?
  ans:
  - Oh...

- que:
  - How did you know I would be here?
  ans:
  - ...Headquarters.

- que:
  - Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
  ans:
  - Harry.

- que:
  - Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
  ans:
  - Here, it will be cold on that train.

- que:
  - What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
  ans:
  - He's safe in the Russian zone.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I saw him today.

- que:
  - Did he say anything about me - tell me?
  ans:
  - Oh, the usual things...

- que:
  - There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
  ans:
  - Of course I didn't tell Calloway.

- que:
  - ...anyway?
  ans:
  - From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.

- que:
  - Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Do you know this man?
  ans:
  - I have never seen him.

- que:
  - Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
  ans:
  - Two weeks ago.

- que:
  - It's true then?
  ans:
  - Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.

- que:
  - Where's Harry?
  ans:
  - That's what we want to find out.

- que:
  - Must you take those?
  ans:
  - They'll be returned, miss.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Just around the corner.

- que:
  - How will I know you?
  ans:
  - I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - This is forgery. It is very clever.

- que:
  - We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
  ans:
  - No, not yet.

- que:
  - Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course.

- que:
  - Can I have that woman's passport?
  ans:
  - Can you tell me whose...

- que:
  - You a friend of Lime's?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Been here long?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When did you see him last?
  ans:
  - September '39.

- que:
  - See much of him before that?
  ans:
  - Once in a while.

- que:
  - I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
  ans:
  - Holly Martins.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Him dying like that.

- que:
  - What are you trying to say?
  ans:
  - He was...

- que:
  - Ever seen one?
  ans:
  - Pin it on a...

- que:
  - Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
  ans:
  - Well, you could say that murder was part...

- que:
  - What the devil?
  ans:
  - Getting around, Martins.

- que:
  - Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
  ans:
  - Calloway.

- que:
  - You're not locking her up?
  ans:
  - Get the next plane.

- que:
  - What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
  ans:
  - A bruised lip.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - In Vienna...

- que:
  - Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
  ans:
  - That is the racket Harry Lime organized.

- que:
  - Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
  ans:
  - Fifty yards right down there.

- que:
  - Which side of the road?
  ans:
  - I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.

- que:
  - How about the doorway?
  ans:
  - I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.

- que:
  - Didn't I?
  ans:
  - You all did.

- que:
  - Win what?
  ans:
  - I'll be your dumb decoy duck.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Two thirty.

- que:
  - Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
  ans:
  - I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.

- que:
  - Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
  ans:
  - Take him to Sacher's.

- que:
  - Shall I go over there, sir?
  ans:
  - No, no. Leave them for a while.

- que:
  - Do you know his number?
  ans:
  - No, I don't know...

- que:
  - You do!
  ans:
  - Well, look, is there a car here I can use?

- que:
  - Welcome?
  ans:
  - They wouldn't know me.

- que:
  - How long can one stay here on this stage money?
  ans:
  - Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.

- que:
  - Heard of Harry Lime?
  ans:
  - Certainly.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.

- que:
  - What is it, Sergeant?
  ans:
  - Mr. Holly Martins, sir.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The author. Thought you might be interested.

- que:
  - Very popular. Are you staying long?
  ans:
  - ...leaving tomorrow, sir.

- que:
  - What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
  ans:
  - You can help her.

- que:
  - ...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
  ans:
  - I told the police.

- que:
  - You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
  ans:
  - Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - You can get somebody else...

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...

- que:
  - As long as they can use you?
  ans:
  - I wish I could get rid of this thing.

- que:
  - You told them, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Don't try to be a policeman, old man.

- que:
  - Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
  ans:
  - ...this way.

- que:
  - Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
  ans:
  - Coffee.

- que:
  - At the end of every chapter --
  ans:
  - You really liked it?

- que:
  - Here?
  ans:
  - ...were of you.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - ...you know and all that.

- que:
  - Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
  ans:
  - A Roumanian.

- que:
  - What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
  ans:
  - Will you give me...

- que:
  - ...your address?
  ans:
  - I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...

- que:
  - What's the name of this girl?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - The Roumanian?
  ans:
  - Yes. The man who helped carry him.

- que:
  - Are you mad?
  ans:
  - All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...

- que:
  - Dr. Winkel?
  ans:
  - Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.

- que:
  - Find out?
  ans:
  - Hear the details.

- que:
  - Could he have been at all conscious?
  ans:
  - I understand...

- que:
  - In great pain?
  ans:
  - Not necessarily.

- que:
  - English?
  ans:
  - Already gone.

- que:
  - Coffin?
  ans:
  - Mr. Lime's. Accident...

- que:
  - Did you know Mr. Lime well?
  ans:
  - Mr. Lime - yes.

- que:
  - What does he say?
  ans:
  - Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.

- que:
  - What's he saying?
  ans:
  - Happened...Yes happened right down there.

- que:
  - Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
  ans:
  - Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.

- que:
  - Who else?
  ans:
  - Kurtz.

- que:
  - The Roumanian?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.

- que:
  - You don't mean that doctor?
  ans:
  - No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.

- que:
  - Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
  ans:
  - I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.

- que:
  - Funny?
  ans:
  - Something wrong.

- que:
  - Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
  ans:
  - He didn't want to get involved.

- que:
  - What else did he tell you?
  ans:
  - That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.

- que:
  - A novel, Mr. Martins?
  ans:
  - Mr. Martins...

- que:
  - Should I make it all fact?
  ans:
  - Why no, Mr. Martins.

- que:
  - ...Mr. Martins?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - What's the purpose of your visit here?
  ans:
  - A friend of mine offered me a job here.

- que:
  - Where are you staying?
  ans:
  - With him. Fifteen Stiffgasse.

- que:
  - His name?
  ans:
  - Lime. Harry Lime.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm Daffy.

- que:
  - Help you out?
  ans:
  - Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.

- que:
  - Thanks.
  ans:
  - Look I don't care about the money right now, I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -

- que:
  - What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
  ans:
  - Traveler.

- que:
  - Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
  ans:
  - One or two kilometers.

- que:
  - We're going to swim \"one or two kilometers\" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
  ans:
  - Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - We think in miles, not kilometers.

- que:
  - So how many miles do you think it is?
  ans:
  - I have no idea but it looks like a long way.

- que:
  - Everyone ok?
  ans:
  - I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.

- que:
  - Big?
  ans:
  - She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.

- que:
  - What about Moliere?
  ans:
  - Fuck off.

- que:
  - Two.
  ans:
  - You can swim?

- que:
  - Richard?
  ans:
  - Bonsoir.

- que:
  - Did you sleep well?
  ans:
  - Not too bad.

- que:
  - So from there to there?
  ans:
  - We swim.

- que:
  - Have you told someone?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Too far?
  ans:
  - If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.

- que:
  - Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
  ans:
  - Where did you lose it?

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.

- que:
  - But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
  ans:
  - We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....

- que:
  - You think?! Based on what?
  ans:
  - What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.

- que:
  - What's a fascist?
  ans:
  - I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.

- que:
  - Are you shitting me? Right in the store?
  ans:
  - She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.

- que:
  - Who the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - Who am I? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. Give it to me.

- que:
  - What, do you like it here?
  ans:
  - Read Mein Kampf? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.

- que:
  - Do we have to listen to this shit?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why'd we have to leave so fast?
  ans:
  - Oh, please...

- que:
  - What do you care?
  ans:
  - I don't, but...

- que:
  - Yeah, but not on the letters.
  ans:
  - How come you know all this shit?

- que:
  - Why the fuck not?
  ans:
  - Just don't.

- que:
  - Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
  ans:
  - Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

- que:
  - Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
  ans:
  - The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.

- que:
  - Disease? What disease?
  ans:
  - Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.

- que:
  - Which is what?
  ans:
  - At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.

- que:
  - You're not in school? What do you do?
  ans:
  - I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.

- que:
  - Where'd you read all that stuff?
  ans:
  - I just read it....

- que:
  - Why no silencer?
  ans:
  - They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.

- que:
  - Are they still together?
  ans:
  - He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.

- que:
  - Is he a Nazi?
  ans:
  - I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.

- que:
  - What's he care about?
  ans:
  - Killing himself.

- que:
  - That's stupid. Why would they?
  ans:
  - You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.

- que:
  - Oh, really?
  ans:
  - Bigger and better.

- que:
  - When can I see you?
  ans:
  - You can't.

- que:
  - Your father?
  ans:
  - He's at a home out here.

- que:
  - Where'd you get this?
  ans:
  - I stole it. From a synagogue.

- que:
  - How come there's no punctuation?
  ans:
  - Do you know it like that? By heart.

- que:
  - What do you care?
  ans:
  - Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...

- que:
  - What's it mean?
  ans:
  - I want to learn to read it.

- que:
  - Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
  ans:
  - Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....

- que:
  - Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
  ans:
  - Good question. Both. Aleph...

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - The sex is better.

- que:
  - Even though his dick is so big?
  ans:
  - With you there's a tragic dimension.

- que:
  - What's it about?
  ans:
  - About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....

- que:
  - And belief follows?
  ans:
  - Fuck that.

- que:
  - Why should I submit?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't.

- que:
  - You think I should just because there's no reason?
  ans:
  - No, I think you shouldn't.

- que:
  - What...? You think I'm Jewish?
  ans:
  - It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.

- que:
  - Do they?
  ans:
  - The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...

- que:
  - Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
  ans:
  - Cause he wasn't a rabbi.

- que:
  - You want a punch in the mouth?
  ans:
  - Okay... Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.

- que:
  - Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
  ans:
  - You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?

- que:
  - Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I just want to try it.

- que:
  - No. What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist.

- que:
  - Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
  ans:
  - I didn't realize you cared.

- que:
  - Did you know that there was a New York Times reporter there that night?
  ans:
  - Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.

- que:
  - I doubt it. How did you find out?
  ans:
  - He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.

- que:
  - Who's Eichmann?!!?
  ans:
  - Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Let's go....

- que:
  - Why are you taking that?
  ans:
  - I'm stealing it.

- que:
  - Did you see how they reacted to him?
  ans:
  - It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.

- que:
  - He's Jewish? Manzetti?
  ans:
  - We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.

- que:
  - People hate Jews. Do you agree?
  ans:
  - They used to. Today it's not an issue.

- que:
  - You wouldn't announce it?
  ans:
  - I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.

- que:
  - ...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
  ans:
  - They're liars and cowards.

- que:
  - I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
  ans:
  - It's the truth....

- que:
  - What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
  ans:
  - A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.

- que:
  - No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.

- que:
  - What about Curtis Zampf?
  ans:
  - Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.

- que:
  - What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
  ans:
  - My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.

- que:
  - A poison...?
  ans:
  - Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.

- que:
  - I don't know. Is that right?
  ans:
  - And Jewish men like to get it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because the Jew is essentially female.

- que:
  - Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
  ans:
  - You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.

- que:
  - Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
  ans:
  - Let's just say I've done due diligence.

- que:
  - Who? How would I know him?
  ans:
  - He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.

- que:
  - You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
  ans:
  - So you're saying it's not true.

- que:
  - That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
  ans:
  - Listen to me....

- que:
  - Why would Nadelman lie?
  ans:
  - Give me a reason not to.

- que:
  - Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How do you reconcile the two?
  ans:
  - I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.

- que:
  - It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
  ans:
  - Get the fuck away from me.

- que:
  - Why did you come tonight? To see me?
  ans:
  - To hear them read Torah.

- que:
  - How did you...?
  ans:
  - I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.

- que:
  - You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
  ans:
  - A forty-five.

- que:
  - The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
  ans:
  - Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.

- que:
  - You shut up. Who do you think you are?
  ans:
  - There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.

- que:
  - How did you get the fucking number?
  ans:
  - Daniel Balint.

- que:
  - Balint?
  ans:
  - It's German.

- que:
  - What part of Germany are you people from?
  ans:
  - From the Rhineland originally.

- que:
  - Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
  ans:
  - I was going to ask you the same thing.

- que:
  - So what Jew would you kill first?
  ans:
  - Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.

- que:
  - You mean Ilio Manzetti?
  ans:
  - Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish. Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.

- que:
  - How have things been going?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Hello...?
  ans:
  - Lina... It's happening. Tonight.

- que:
  - What is happening?
  ans:
  - Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.

- que:
  - What about chicken?
  ans:
  - That's meat.

- que:
  - But you already talked about it, you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
  ans:
  - Steve...

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes. He doesn't want me around.

- que:
  - Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
  ans:
  - Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...

- que:
  - Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
  ans:
  - What kids?...

- que:
  - The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
  ans:
  - Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.

- que:
  - Hello...?
  ans:
  - Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the New York Times.

- que:
  - Who knows what that is?
  ans:
  - A Jewish prayer.

- que:
  - Which was his room?
  ans:
  - Number ten.

- que:
  - Where's Mrs. Moebius?
  ans:
  - Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.

- que:
  - Which one were you aiming at?
  ans:
  - The mother.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs. A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - Open it up.

- que:
  - That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.

- que:
  - What about Drake, did he ever show up?
  ans:
  - No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.

- que:
  - Didn't you get anything?
  ans:
  - I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.

- que:
  - Oh, what is this shit?
  ans:
  - Keep driving. Don't slow down.

- que:
  - Who even knew?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Moebius.

- que:
  - Why? Why would she?
  ans:
  - The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.

- que:
  - So what do we do with the device?
  ans:
  - Take a right on 59th... We'll put it someplace else.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I have an idea....

- que:
  - When do you want it to go off?
  ans:
  - Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.

- que:
  - Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...

- que:
  - JTS...?
  ans:
  - What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.

- que:
  - Are you an artist?
  ans:
  - No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - You want to kill a Jew. I already did.

- que:
  - Who'd you kill?
  ans:
  - Four. But no one this important.

- que:
  - How did you know they were Jews?
  ans:
  - I can tell....

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - You can't say that....

- que:
  - Exactly.
  ans:
  - Do I give a shit?

- que:
  - Who's this?
  ans:
  - Dennis Leary.

- que:
  - Leary?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Funny?
  ans:
  - Not like Mr. Dorfmann.

- que:
  - Just a little... What's the difference?
  ans:
  - We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.

- que:
  - Fund-raising?
  ans:
  - We think you'd be good at it.

- que:
  - Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
  ans:
  - Beth Shalom? It's Reform.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - They're not that Jewish.

- que:
  - I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
  ans:
  - We tested the new bomb.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.

- que:
  - None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
  ans:
  - Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?

- que:
  - In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Does he know?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And you...? Do you love Enzo?
  ans:
  - Very much, I think. But, there's going to be a problem.

- que:
  - You're leaving?
  ans:
  - Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.

- que:
  - Did you tell him?
  ans:
  - Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.

- que:
  - Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
  ans:
  - I said that the file is incomplete.

- que:
  - Did the driver really freeze?
  ans:
  - The documents are forged.

- que:
  - I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
  ans:
  - Italian is practically the same thing.

- que:
  - The Italian, I presume?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where did you two meet?
  ans:
  - In a lake.

- que:
  - A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti?
  ans:
  - He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.

- que:
  - Have you known him long?
  ans:
  - Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.

- que:
  - What was he like, when he was little?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - ... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana?
  ans:
  - Congratulations, Enzo.

- que:
  - Don't you agree, Jacques?
  ans:
  - And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail.

- que:
  - Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
  ans:
  - Well, good night, then...

- que:
  - You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
  ans:
  - Is it a poem?

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Checking out the competition.

- que:
  - What else is there?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm talking about.

- que:
  - A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
  ans:
  - No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.

- que:
  - You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
  ans:
  - ... Not yet.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Ten thousand.

- que:
  - Lira?
  ans:
  - Dollars.

- que:
  - You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
  ans:
  - In my village, we have a saying, when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.

- que:
  - Roberto? How long?
  ans:
  - Six seconds.

- que:
  - Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
  ans:
  - Have the car painted.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.

- que:
  - The medics are looking all over for you.
  ans:
  - What about the shoes?

- que:
  - Where did you get that?
  ans:
  - \"That\"! This is not a \"that\"...

- que:
  - Is he here?
  ans:
  - He's training.

- que:
  - Plenty of women everywhere right?
  ans:
  - Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

- que:
  - ... What's your name again?
  ans:
  - Noireuter.

- que:
  - What's with the voice?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.

- que:
  - Try speaking to me?
  ans:
  - Is that alcohol? Are you out of your mind? Alcohol is strictly forbidden.

- que:
  - You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Jacques, my friend, how are you?
  ans:
  - Enzo...

- que:
  - That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion?
  ans:
  - Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.

- que:
  - ... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course. Lots of questions.

- que:
  - Well, what are they?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.

- que:
  - How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
  ans:
  - It's okay.

- que:
  - ... You married?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
  ans:
  - So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?

- que:
  - People say that?
  ans:
  - ... For the mermaids.

- que:
  - No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
  ans:
  - ... Everything.

- que:
  - Everything about what?
  ans:
  - Well... about everything.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because pasta should be eaten \"Al Dente\". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.

- que:
  - Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
  ans:
  - Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.

- que:
  - You still collect them?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You don't have that one, do you?
  ans:
  - No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.

- que:
  - You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
  ans:
  - ... Yes.

- que:
  - Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all.
  ans:
  - It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know?

- que:
  - Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
  ans:
  - I'm concentrating.

- que:
  - ... I was right about what?
  ans:
  - ... It is much better down there. It's a better place.

- que:
  - A drink to warm up?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.

- que:
  - We saw each other a little while ago.
  ans:
  - Tea... or whiskey?

- que:
  - In the lake?
  ans:
  - No... in the hut.

- que:
  - But what brought you to Sicily?
  ans:
  - I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.

- que:
  - I don't know... why?
  ans:
  - Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.

- que:
  - I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd be at the dinner.

- que:
  - You jumped in?
  ans:
  - Only to help the medics, I assure you.

- que:
  - No. I want to show you. Is it ruined?
  ans:
  - Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...

- que:
  - How can you tell it's a female?
  ans:
  - ... The way she moves.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I just feel it.

- que:
  - Jacques, you set a world record.
  ans:
  - Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's me... Johana.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - I got fired.

- que:
  - So have I. ... Hello?
  ans:
  - I'm still here.

- que:
  - Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
  ans:
  - No... tell me.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's me again.

- que:
  - I'm being a pain, huh?
  ans:
  - ... Not at all.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Absolutely positive.

- que:
  - Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
  ans:
  - I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.

- que:
  - And you?
  ans:
  - I didn't dive.

- que:
  - You'll try again tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - ... Nothing.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.

- que:
  - Jacques...?
  ans:
  - You go back, I'll walk.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.

- que:
  - ... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
  ans:
  - ... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.

- que:
  - You've got to tell me what happened?
  ans:
  - I saw how it has to be.

- que:
  - ... Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Positive, Sir.

- que:
  - This is the hotel San Domenico?
  ans:
  - Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.

- que:
  - Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
  ans:
  - No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.

- que:
  - Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
  ans:
  - Why don't you ask me?

- que:
  - Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
  ans:
  - I brought Johana to meet you.

- que:
  - Where are you from, Henrietta?
  ans:
  - Johana... New York.

- que:
  - What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
  ans:
  - Well... here.

- que:
  - In my apartment?
  ans:
  - You're back! Hello. We were burgled.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - They got the new T.V.

- que:
  - You called the police?
  ans:
  - They're going to send detectives.

- que:
  - How was your trip?
  ans:
  - Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.

- que:
  - Okay... Who'd you meet?
  ans:
  - It's his heartbeat.

- que:
  - Haven't you been listening?
  ans:
  - ... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.

- que:
  - Does that have a hidden meaning?
  ans:
  - No. I'm just depressed.

- que:
  - What are they for?
  ans:
  - They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.

- que:
  - If there was a problem, they could do something right?
  ans:
  - Of course, that's what they're for.

- que:
  - But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
  ans:
  - Yes... It's magic.

- que:
  - Who... Who is that?
  ans:
  - Mayol... Jacques Mayol.

- que:
  - That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
  ans:
  - ... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment.

- que:
  - But... how is he going to breathe?
  ans:
  - He isn't going to breathe.

- que:
  - How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
  ans:
  - It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.

- que:
  - Why is he doing this?
  ans:
  - For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.

- que:
  - Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
  ans:
  - Coffee might be nice.

- que:
  - Will he understand Spanish?
  ans:
  - His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.

- que:
  - Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
  ans:
  - You've made me a happy insurance person.

- que:
  - ... Yes?
  ans:
  - I'll go see how he's doing.

- que:
  - What's your first move?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.

- que:
  - You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
  ans:
  - That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.

- que:
  - So why the long face?
  ans:
  - It's Esther. Santa's got her.

- que:
  - Please. Will you help me?
  ans:
  - There won't be any need for that sir.

- que:
  - So. Do you have a name?
  ans:
  - It's Esther.

- que:
  - You like my Mordechai, yes?
  ans:
  - He's...he's very nice. But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.

- que:
  - Mr. Jefferson Carver?
  ans:
  - Please, call me Mordechai.

- que:
  - Client notes. Sorry. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.

- que:
  - How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
  ans:
  - Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.

- que:
  - Any sign of Santa?
  ans:
  - What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.

- que:
  - So, now what?
  ans:
  - Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.

- que:
  - Want to get a drink?
  ans:
  - Sure. Why not.

- que:
  - You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
  ans:
  - What was that!?

- que:
  - Mordechai?
  ans:
  - Yes Esther.

- que:
  - When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
  ans:
  - Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - We go to the same temple.

- que:
  - Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
  ans:
  - Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.

- que:
  - Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
  ans:
  - ...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.

- que:
  - Okay, what's the information?
  ans:
  - She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1,30 to 3,00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.

- que:
  - I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
  ans:
  - Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.

- que:
  - Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.

- que:
  - Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
  ans:
  - Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.

- que:
  - What's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - He's still working out some identity issues.

- que:
  - Cool. What's it do?
  ans:
  - Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!

- que:
  - Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. Take a look.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.

- que:
  - A stereo type alarm system?
  ans:
  - Take a look.

- que:
  - How do we bypass it?
  ans:
  - Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.

- que:
  - Hammer, you alright?
  ans:
  - Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.

- que:
  - Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
  ans:
  - Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.

- que:
  - Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
  ans:
  - In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.

- que:
  - I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
  ans:
  - Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.

- que:
  - What should I charge?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.

- que:
  - So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
  ans:
  - Worse.

- que:
  - So, how was I?
  ans:
  - It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.

- que:
  - I wasn't too over the top?
  ans:
  - No, it was the perfect level.

- que:
  - No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.

- que:
  - What's going on? Why'd he stop?
  ans:
  - Maybe he ran out of ammo.

- que:
  - What day is it?
  ans:
  - It's Friday.

- que:
  - That depends. How much money has he?
  ans:
  - When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.

- que:
  - I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
  ans:
  - Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.

- que:
  - Good looking?
  ans:
  - Mmmyes.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - You get your money from your husband.

- que:
  - Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
  ans:
  - You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.

- que:
  - Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
  ans:
  - I drink.

- que:
  - Then what do you do?
  ans:
  - I sleep it off.

- que:
  - But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You really think so, Charlie?
  ans:
  - They all say the cat killed this second girl.

- que:
  - I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Where's that man?
  ans:
  - Up at the museum.

- que:
  - What do you want to see him for?
  ans:
  - I want him to lock me up.

- que:
  - What did they say before the bad card came up?
  ans:
  - The elderly man I told you about.

- que:
  - When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
  ans:
  - Love is different for different people.

- que:
  - Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
  ans:
  - You think be's pretty nice, don't you?

- que:
  - Show business?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd best be off.

- que:
  - You're worrying about its killing someone else?
  ans:
  - Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.

- que:
  - You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
  ans:
  - No. I'm quite sure.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.

- que:
  - You know Charlie How-Come?
  ans:
  - We're old friends.

- que:
  - Come to look around?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - About Charlie's leopard?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh?
  ans:
  - Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.

- que:
  - Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
  ans:
  - Some other time.

- que:
  - You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
  ans:
  - But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.

- que:
  - I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
  ans:
  - He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.

- que:
  - I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
  ans:
  - You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard  Don't you?

- que:
  - Why did you give up teaching?
  ans:
  - Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.

- que:
  - Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
  ans:
  - No. He was kidding Charlie.

- que:
  - State hunters?
  ans:
  - Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.

- que:
  - Chief, don't you understand what this means?
  ans:
  - You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.

- que:
  - That's a fact, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.

- que:
  - You won't go to Galbraith with me?
  ans:
  - Get it out of here!

- que:
  - Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
  ans:
  - No - not yet.

- que:
  - Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
  ans:
  - No  not yet.

- que:
  - Clo-Clo?
  ans:
  - I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - What did he have to do - look at the body?

- que:
  - Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
  ans:
  - And did you find the leopard?

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.

- que:
  - And not a sign of the leopard?
  ans:
  - I can use them.

- que:
  - Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
  ans:
  - That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.

- que:
  - And she waited here for him?
  ans:
  - Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.

- que:
  - What else do you care about, Kicks?
  ans:
  - You. Us.

- que:
  - You're positive of that, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I got into a little crap game.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - It's all right. I'm not hurt.

- que:
  - All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
  ans:
  - Aint nobody out there, Mister.

- que:
  - Nobody? Huh!... How come?
  ans:
  - Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...

- que:
  - You a tourist?
  ans:
  - Thats right.

- que:
  - Will you please come with me?
  ans:
  - That might depend on where youre going.

- que:
  - Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
  ans:
  - Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.

- que:
  - When will they be back?
  ans:
  - Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...

- que:
  - By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
  ans:
  - I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.

- que:
  - You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir. Would you like a drink while you wait?
  ans:
  - No. Thank you. Ill be fine...

- que:
  - What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
  ans:
  - I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.

- que:
  - Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
  ans:
  - Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.

- que:
  - Can it be that you want your brother found?
  ans:
  - Anything is possible.

- que:
  - You... You found that at Leons?
  ans:
  - Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.

- que:
  - I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
  ans:
  - I will of course do my best to hang onto it.

- que:
  - Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
  ans:
  - I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.

- que:
  - How dare you... You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
  ans:
  - The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.

- que:
  - Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
  ans:
  - You drive a hard bargain.

- que:
  - Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
  ans:
  - Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.

- que:
  - You lost my money?
  ans:
  - You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.

- que:
  - Who is Friedman?
  ans:
  - The man who sold the boy to your brother.

- que:
  - W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
  ans:
  - You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.

- que:
  - Have you got a pen?
  ans:
  - Just a moment... Go ahead.

- que:
  - Paul Lamont...?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.

- que:
  - Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
  ans:
  - Im really sorry you were not called...

- que:
  - Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
  ans:
  - Black suits you.

- que:
  - Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
  ans:
  - You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...

- que:
  - You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
  ans:
  - Youre mad...

- que:
  - I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
  ans:
  - Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.

- que:
  - You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
  ans:
  - Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.

- que:
  - What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
  ans:
  - My brother hung himself.

- que:
  - If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
  ans:
  - Leon could still have hung himself.

- que:
  - One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
  ans:
  - Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.

- que:
  - Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
  ans:
  - Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.

- que:
  - Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
  ans:
  - You splendid bastard...

- que:
  - Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
  ans:
  - ...Were turning in circles.

- que:
  - What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Something like that?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
  ans:
  - Here we go again.

- que:
  - Where is that?
  ans:
  - Simplify and damn.

- que:
  - Should I?
  ans:
  - You seem to know what youre talking about.

- que:
  - To get me killed...?
  ans:
  - No. Not us...

- que:
  - What do you suggest?
  ans:
  - I dont know. Everyones dead...

- que:
  - Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
  ans:
  - You wouldnt understand.

- que:
  - OPERATOR Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
  ans:
  - Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.

- que:
  - A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
  ans:
  - OPERATOR Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.

- que:
  - Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
  ans:
  - A coffee and a couple of croissants.

- que:
  - Crow what?
  ans:
  - Croissants.

- que:
  - Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
  ans:
  - Croissants. Like that...

- que:
  - May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
  ans:
  - Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.

- que:
  - You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
  ans:
  - I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...

- que:
  - Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
  ans:
  - Im fine standing, thank you.

- que:
  - Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right?
  ans:
  - A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.

- que:
  - Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
  ans:
  - The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.

- que:
  - By your Austrian?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
  ans:
  - No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.

- que:
  - You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
  ans:
  - I know where to look.

- que:
  - No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
  ans:
  - Im sure Ill find a way.

- que:
  - Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
  ans:
  - Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...

- que:
  - Did you not enter this country illegally?
  ans:
  - Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - Friedmans dead... They killed him...

- que:
  - So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
  ans:
  - Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.

- que:
  - Italian? The Mafia...?
  ans:
  - Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.

- que:
  - Do you know a friendly cop?
  ans:
  - That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...

- que:
  - Its up to you whether they walk or not.
  ans:
  - Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!

- que:
  - What about your friendly cop?
  ans:
  - Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.

- que:
  - I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
  ans:
  - Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me.

- que:
  - And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
  ans:
  - Hi...

- que:
  - Emily...
  ans:
  - Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?

- que:
  - Im calling about the puppies.
  ans:
  - Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people! Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!

- que:
  - Have we done business before?
  ans:
  - I saw the ad at Georges. Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - This is a bad line.

- que:
  - Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months. Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes... Good, good...

- que:
  - So, what are you looking for?
  ans:
  - What about an untrained pup, white...

- que:
  - I see. How much?
  ans:
  - I dont know. Hes gone! Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...

- que:
  - ...On holiday?
  ans:
  - Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...

- que:

  ans:
  - Who? Martin... Hes Martin...

- que:
  - Ever seen him before?
  ans:

  - I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I... Man, youve got to get me out of here...

- que:
  - How many of you scumbags are here?
  ans:
  - Just me... Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...

  - Whats the Ambassador?
  ans:
  - Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe... I need a doctor...

- que:
  - What about the staff? Theyre in on whats going on, arent they? How many of them?
  ans:
  - F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...

- que:
  - What colour is your car? What colour is your car?
  ans:
  - B-Black...

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...

- que:
  - Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir. Would you like to leave a message?
  ans:
  - Ill call again.

- que:
  - The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
  ans:
  - Can I have the reception desk, please.

- que:
  - Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
  ans:
  - Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.

- que:
  - You sure you passed on my message?
  ans:
  - I certainly did, sir...

- que:
  - Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
  ans:
  - That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.

- que:
  - Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
  ans:
  - Oh... We split up.

- que:
  - Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
  ans:
  - Its not.

- que:
  - Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.
  ans:
  - Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?

- que:
  - What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
  ans:
  - Hello, Jane. Its me.

- que:
  - Carlos De Moraes?
  ans:
  - Yes. How did...

- que:
  - Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
  ans:
  - I hope its not too significant.

- que:
  - What if it is?
  ans:
  - Whatever, you come recommended. We...

- que:
  - Didnt you say I came recommended? Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
  ans:
  - You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.

- que:
  - Do what, Mr Lombard?
  ans:
  - Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.

- que:
  - Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
  ans:
  - Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.

- que:
  - I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
  ans:
  - No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...

- que:
  - Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
  ans:
  - When... Im told he came here...

- que:
  - Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
  ans:
  - Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.

- que:
  - 10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
  ans:
  - Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.

- que:
  - What happens now?
  ans:
  - We conclude our transaction.

- que:
  - Is my money in there?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.

- que:
  - Am I supposed to know him?
  ans:
  - Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.

- que:
  - No. In Hampstead... Why?
  ans:
  - Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...

- que:
  - Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
  ans:
  - Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.

- que:
  - Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
  ans:
  - Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - Dying without ever reaching the top...

- que:
  - Trying to say something, Martin?
  ans:
  - Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...

- que:
  - The Hyatt...? Whats that?
  ans:
  - Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...

- que:
  - Its about the puppy. You got the money?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - At what time will you be available?
  ans:
  - Three oclock.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...

- que:
  - Have you?
  ans:
  - The person who put us in touch seems to think so.

- que:
  - An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
  ans:
  - Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it just you or...

- que:
  - No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
  ans:
  - Leon? No. Im afraid he left.

- que:
  - Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
  ans:
  - Is this some kind of mugging? Because...

- que:
  - Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
  ans:
  - As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.

- que:
  - Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
  ans:
  - He just said he had good reasons.

- que:
  - Good reasons?
  ans:
  - His mother would be pleased to hear that.

- que:
  - Who else knows about the boy?
  ans:
  - My sister... She lives in the next valley.

- que:
  - I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
  ans:
  - Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.

- que:
  - Ive been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
  ans:
  - Er... Yes...

- que:
  - The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
  ans:
  - Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...

- que:
  - Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
  ans:
  - ... No.

- que:
  - You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
  ans:
  - He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...

- que:
  - Hows the boy doing?
  ans:
  - Fine...

- que:
  - I... How long have I been here?
  ans:
  - Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.

- que:
  - Los Angeles?
  ans:
  - Los Angeles is 100 miles away.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
  ans:
  - I know his work better than I know him.

- que:
  - What about which girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.

- que:
  - Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
  ans:
  - Fucked-up fucking weird.

- que:
  - Quest-ce que tu veux?
  ans:
  - Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.

- que:
  - O est pass ton salon?
  ans:
  - Mon bureau cotait trop cher.

- que:
  - Then why dont you reach him?
  ans:
  - I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.

- que:
  - Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
  ans:
  - Who? I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.

- que:
  - Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
  ans:
  - If he had, youd be dead.

- que:
  - What do you think, huh?
  ans:
  - I think youd rather not know what I think.

- que:
  - Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
  ans:
  - Try again, and this time be polite.

- que:
  - What sums?
  ans:
  - Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...

- que:
  - Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
  ans:
  - Thats what he said...

- que:
  - What you gonna do? Kill me?
  ans:
  - Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.

- que:
  - Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
  ans:
  - Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...

- que:
  - Mossad?
  ans:
  - Its a good guess...

- que:
  - DAIS Very funny. Can I go on now?
  ans:
  - ITALIAN ACCENT Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - My lord, I'm not sure that...

- que:
  - Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
  ans:
  - Of course I am, it's just that...

- que:
  - Very generous of you all. How much?
  ans:
  - 10,000 gold crowns.

- que:
  - What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
  ans:
  - Tremoille... don't. Please...

- que:
  - Do you think I could have some water?
  ans:
  - I would like some fresh straw.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yes. I didn't confess today.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Better today than tomorrow.

- que:
  - Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
  ans:
  - Uh... they said... they will think about it.

- que:
  - The king said you're his finest archer...?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
  ans:
  - Because there's an arrow in your leg.

- que:
  - So... what am I supposed to do now?
  ans:
  - They've abandoned me... like everyone.

- que:
  - What... what do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...

- que:
  - Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
  ans:
  - It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.

- que:
  - But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
  ans:
  - I don't know it. I feel it.

- que:
  - That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
  ans:
  - You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.

- que:
  - What did the king say?
  ans:
  - He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...

- que:
  - Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
  ans:
  - To marry you.

- que:
  - But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
  ans:
  - But it is what I want.

- que:
  - Will you at least let me stay with you?
  ans:
  - It would not be the same without you.

- que:
  - Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
  ans:
  - No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.

- que:
  - Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
  ans:
  - I tried to.

- que:
  - It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - I don't remember. Maybe.

- que:
  - Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
  ans:
  - No... I said \"Surrender in the name of the King of France\"...

- que:
  - Do you have a sword?
  ans:
  - Quite a few.

- que:
  - Didn't you also carry a banner?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
  ans:
  - I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.

- que:
  - And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
  ans:
  - No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - And so I... I prefer my banner.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To avoid killing anyone.

- que:
  - Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
  ans:
  - No, of course not... I never killed anyone...

- que:
  - Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
  ans:
  - We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...

- que:
  - So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
  ans:
  - Yes, but...

- que:
  - Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
  ans:
  - No, I... I held it up to...

- que:
  - You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
  ans:
  - Yes, maybe... I don't remember...

- que:
  - It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size. Am I correct, Bishop?
  ans:
  - I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...

- que:
  - And when was that?
  ans:
  - Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...

- que:
  - Who's running this trial, you or her? I can't believe it! This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
  ans:
  - She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...

- que:
  - Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
  ans:
  - I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.

- que:
  - Am I... am I dead?
  ans:
  - Dead you're worthless, darling.

- que:
  - Where... where am I?
  ans:
  - Guess.

- que:
  - Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
  ans:
  - Quick -- hide in here...

- que:
  - But where are you going to be?
  ans:
  - I'll be right here... I promise.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.

- que:
  - Trial? What trial?
  ans:
  - Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.

- que:
  - But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
  ans:
  - It seems that the English care more about you than the French.

- que:
  - The English?
  ans:
  - Yes. They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.

- que:
  - So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
  ans:
  - My name is Jeanne. My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me. I would like to have it back.

- que:
  - Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
  ans:
  - In a village called Domremy.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Nineteen... or thereabouts...

- que:
  - Were you baptized?
  ans:
  - Yes. In the church at Domremy.

- que:
  - I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
  ans:
  - Not long ago...

- que:
  - When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
  ans:
  - Last night.

- que:
  - What were you doing when the voice came?
  ans:
  - Praying.

- que:
  - The voice was in your cell?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did it tell you?
  ans:
  - Many things...

- que:
  - Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
  ans:
  - It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.

- que:
  - I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
  ans:
  - No... I want to be confessed.

- que:
  - I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
  ans:
  - And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...

- que:
  - Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
  ans:
  - He's feeling wonderful.

- que:
  - I understand. How much?
  ans:
  - 20,000?! But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.

- que:
  - You will?
  ans:
  - For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.

- que:
  - ... and what... what did he say?
  ans:
  - I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...

- que:
  - Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
  ans:
  - Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...

- que:
  - So how would you put it?
  ans:
  - Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!

- que:
  - I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
  ans:
  - Your majesty, I really think you...

- que:
  - Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
  ans:
  - Go and ask him yourself.

- que:
  - You told us about the appearance of this... voice. What exactly did you see? Part of it... or all of it?
  ans:
  - His face.

- que:
  - Does he have hair?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is it long and hanging down?
  ans:
  - I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.

- que:
  - May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
  ans:
  - 20,000 gold crowns.

- que:
  - Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
  ans:
  - Yes... they were.

- que:
  - Everywhere. Where is the food?
  ans:
  - It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...

- que:
  - Good. Can you bring me to him?
  ans:
  - He's on the other side of the river.

- que:
  - Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
  ans:
  - For what?

- que:
  - So... what is the message?
  ans:
  - We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace. If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.

- que:
  - Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
  ans:
  - Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.

- que:
  - Well...? Shall we go?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
  ans:
  - As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.

- que:
  - And... what does Jeanne think?
  ans:
  - I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.

- que:
  - Clear?
  ans:
  - Perfectly.

- que:
  - You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
  ans:
  - I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...

- que:
  - Bravo! What about all the other hundreds of prisoners? Do we let them go too?
  ans:
  - Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...

- que:
  - But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
  ans:
  - He never sent them... Don't you understand? He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...

- que:
  - MAISTRE Who told you to wear men's clothes?
  ans:
  - The clothes are not important...

- que:
  - MAISTRE So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
  ans:
  - I... submit to Our Lord.

- que:
  - Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
  ans:
  - I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.

- que:
  - Did your voice tell you to jump?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - How can you deny it when you just said \"I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English\"...?
  ans:
  - That's now what I meant...

- que:
  - You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
  ans:
  - Yes, but...

- que:
  - Stop it! What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Nothing... just taking his teeth.

- que:
  - Sorry Jeanne... Did you both meet already?
  ans:
  - Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.

- que:
  - Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
  ans:
  - I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life! But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...

- que:
  - When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
  ans:
  - Yes... a half-steed... white.

- que:
  - Who gave you that horse?
  ans:
  - My king.

- que:
  - How many did he give you?
  ans:
  - Five steeds and a few hackneys...

- que:
  - As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
  ans:
  - Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...

- que:
  - Jeanne... what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Playing...

- que:
  - What have you done to me?
  ans:
  - I -- I -- I...

- que:
  - Who... who are you...?
  ans:
  - I am that I am. You don't like my face? Maybe you prefer this one...

- que:
  - Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God?
  ans:
  - No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...

- que:
  - YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
  ans:
  - I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...

- que:
  - I... don't know... what do you want from me?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'm here to set you free...

- que:
  - What are you doing out here?
  ans:
  - I might ask you the same question.

- que:
  - I don't understand. What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - I told you already... I'm here to set you free...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - My... visions...

- que:
  - They won't come anyway.
  ans:
  - They're going to come and visit you in here?

- que:
  - Why would they?
  ans:
  - Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - \"Let all who love me follow me\"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne, be honest. You fought for yourself, in your name.

- que:
  - No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
  ans:
  - No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...

- que:
  - What are you doing on the wall?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.

- que:
  - Do you think this cross will protect you?
  ans:
  - No, I...

- que:
  - My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Are you going to leave me too?
  ans:
  - Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.

- que:
  - Are you sent by God?
  ans:
  - There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...

- que:
  - Do you think you are ready?
  ans:
  - Yes I am.

- que:
  - Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - ... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - You think you are ready now?
  ans:
  - Yes, my lord.

- que:
  - So... alright. What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
  ans:
  - I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.

- que:
  - Whose were they?
  ans:
  - My father's.

- que:
  - Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
  ans:
  - Oh yes... very.

- que:
  - And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, she's... wonderful.

- que:
  - Good, good. And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.

- que:
  - And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, I play with them... lots...

- que:
  - So... everything sounds... wonderful?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - Then... why are you here so often?
  ans:
  - I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.

- que:
  - Him?
  ans:
  - Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.

- que:
  - Who is this \"he\"?
  ans:
  - He never says his name.

- que:
  - What... does he... look like?
  ans:
  - Beautiful.

- que:
  - He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
  ans:
  - Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.

- que:
  - Why did she have to die?
  ans:
  - Only God knows the answer to that.

- que:
  - Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
  ans:
  - It's like this... I...we...all of them.

- que:
  - Someone you know?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - A beauty. Who is she?
  ans:
  - A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.

- que:
  - How are you doing?
  ans:
  - Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful.

- que:
  - How long have you been married?
  ans:
  - Just over a year.

- que:
  - And how's Yurek?
  ans:
  - Dead.

- que:
  - When's your baby due?
  ans:
  - Christmas. This is not a good time to have children. But then...

- que:
  - Will I still be able to play?
  ans:
  - Let's find out.

- que:
  - Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
  ans:
  - To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.

- que:
  - Calm down, what, what is it?
  ans:
  - They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Funny time to say this.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - wish I knew you better.

- que:
  - Can you help us?
  ans:
  - It costs.

- que:
  - Who told you?
  ans:
  - People I know. They said you're an important man.

- que:
  - Who's recruiting?
  ans:
  - Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!

- que:
  - What d'you mean, take the table away?
  ans:
  - The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.

- que:
  - What's this about?
  ans:
  - Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
  ans:
  - Boys, boys...

- que:
  - We use what?
  ans:
  - Of course they'll notice it. But look-- This is a good place for something.

- que:
  - You sell anything?
  ans:
  - Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.

- que:
  - Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
  ans:
  - I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.

- que:
  - They were taking you away.
  ans:
  - What did you pay him?

- que:
  - It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
  ans:
  - You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.

- que:
  - What's the matter? Are you sick?
  ans:
  - Hungry.

- que:
  - What's that mean, no employment certificate?
  ans:
  - You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...

- que:
  - Otherwise what?
  ans:
  - You'll be deported.

- que:
  - Yes, so did the Germans.
  ans:
  - What are you reading?

- que:
  - Yes, but what good did it do?
  ans:
  - Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.

- que:
  - So, what's the news?
  ans:
  - The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.

- que:
  - I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
  ans:
  - Not this week.

- que:
  - You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
  ans:
  - Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.

- que:
  - Why didn't you come to me?
  ans:
  - I didn't know you were in the certificate business.

- que:
  - Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
  ans:
  - Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.

- que:
  - Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
  ans:
  - Wladek! How are you?

- que:
  - Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
  ans:
  - Since last night. I was pleased to see you.

- que:
  - You made contact?
  ans:
  - Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.

- que:
  - And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
  ans:
  - Pack, Wladek, there's no time.

- que:
  - No, I don't think so?
  ans:
  - Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.

- que:
  - CAPTAIN What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - I was... I was trying to open this tin.

  ans:
  - In the attic.

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - CAPTAIN We're getting out.

- que:
  - Are the Russians here?
  ans:
  - CAPTAIN Not yet.

- que:
  - CAPTAIN I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
  ans:
  - I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.

- que:
  - ... without a shred of manners.
  ans:
  - To be deaf?

- que:
  - Like it were a piano?
  ans:
  - It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.

- que:
  - No sound at all?
  ans:
  - No, it was a table.

- que:
  - Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.

  ans:
  - Someone died here. It's tapu.

- que:
  - They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
  ans:
  - No, no they know another track - to the side of this.

- que:
  - Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
  ans:
  - I'd like to make a swap.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - The piano.

- que:
  - The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
  ans:
  - You'd have to organise it up here.

- que:
  - Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
  ans:
  - I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.

- que:
  - No, words. You have never heard words?
  ans:
  - No, not words.

- que:
  - Spoken words?
  ans:
  - No, but her words are in my head. I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - She says, throw the piano overboard.

- que:
  - I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What's in here then, lead?
  ans:
  - It's my mother's piano.

- que:
  - A piano?
  ans:
  - Oh no, it can't come now.

- que:
  - What on?
  ans:
  - On your piano, that is the swap.

- que:
  - What does she say?
  ans:
  - She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.

- que:
  - And when is the next lesson?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow.

- que:
  - What will I play?
  ans:
  - Play a gig.

- que:
  - You the owner here?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - All right if I look around your lobby?
  ans:
  - No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.

- que:
  - Who told ya this guy was in here?
  ans:
  - Nobody. I just know what kinda women he likes. I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.

- que:
  - I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
  ans:
  - Right through there. But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

- que:
  - What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
  ans:
  - I don't have to. You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall.

- que:
  - What's the line on Visitation?
  ans:
  - 7 to 2. That ain't bad.

- que:
  - Billie. You ready?
  ans:
  - Yeh, go ahead.

- que:
  - You wanted by the law or somethin'?
  ans:
  - Naw, it's okay.

- que:
  - You got a bag or somethin?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How 'bout a handkerchief?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - Jesus, what a bundle. Did you know he was that loaded?
  ans:
  - Hell no, I just cut into him. I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.

- que:
  - Twist! When did you get back in town?
  ans:
  - Coupla days ago. I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.

- que:
  - Twist, you know this guy?
  ans:
  - No. Never saw him before. He's a dick, though.

- que:
  - You're late. Where you been?
  ans:
  - I had some appointments.

- que:
  - How much did ya lose?
  ans:
  - All of it.

- que:
  - You think my play is bad?
  ans:
  - I think it's the best...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm gettin' too slow for this racket. I done the best I'm gonna do. You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.

- que:
  - What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
  ans:
  - Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet. I can go halfsies with 'em! It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.

- que:
  - You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
  ans:
  - I'm out, Johnny.

- que:
  - Then why ain't he dead?
  ans:
  - They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all. They'll get him next time.

- que:
  - You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
  ans:
  - Hell yes. He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.

- que:
  - Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side. How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
  ans:
  - They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero. Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.

- que:
  - You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
  ans:
  - Wasn't no problem a mine.

- que:
  - He was a con man, wasn't he?
  ans:
  - He was a tear-off rat. He got what he deserved. No sense helpin' pay his bills.

- que:
  - Which way did he do, Eirie?
  ans:
  - Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.

- que:
  - I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - Doyle, can I see you a minute?
  ans:
  - I'm busy, Floyd.

- que:
  - Which one?
  ans:
  - Mottola.

- que:
  - You sure he didn't just pocket it?
  ans:
  - No, we checked his story with a tipster. He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.

- que:
  - They workin' for anybody?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Could be. We're runnin' that down now.

- que:
  - What about the other one?
  ans:
  - They're still looking for him.

- que:
  - Who's got the contract?
  ans:
  - Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.

- que:
  - They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed. They figure maybe he skipped town. You wanna follow 'em up?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - What do ya want the others to get?
  ans:
  - Nothin'. They gotta be outa there early. I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.

- que:
  - What am I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me?
  ans:
  - Looks all right. It's big enough and off the street.

- que:
  - Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
  ans:
  - All he's gotta do is read.

- que:
  - I can talk, can't I?
  ans:
  - Glad to meet ya, kid. You're a real horse's ass.

- que:
  - He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
  ans:
  - You mean you blew it.

- que:
  - You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
  ans:
  - I picked something up on the way.

- que:
  - Lonnegan after you, too?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Haven't seen anybody.

- que:
  - Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
  ans:
  - You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.

- que:
  - You know anything about him?
  ans:
  - Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.

- que:
  - Then you'll do it?
  ans:
  - He's not as tough as he'd like to think.

- que:
  - How'd ya do?
  ans:
  - Well we got some workin' money anyway.

- que:
  - Everything go all right?
  ans:
  - Yeh, it was easy.

- que:
  - What do ya mean?
  ans:
  - You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.

- que:
  - How 'bout Lonnegan?
  ans:
  - I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - He threatened to kill me.

- que:
  - Did he say he wouldn't?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
  ans:
  - I thought I'd lost him.

- que:
  - Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
  ans:
  - Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.

- que:
  - Then why'd ya move outa your room?
  ans:
  - It was too noisy.

- que:
  - You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
  ans:
  - All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.

- que:
  - How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
  ans:
  - I better do some packin'. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.

- que:
  - Then why you doin' it?
  ans:
  - Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.

- que:
  - You wanta wait for your share?
  ans:
  - Naw, I'd just blow it.

- que:
  - Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
  ans:
  - We'll use the wire. Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.

- que:
  - He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie. How much cash we got?
  ans:
  - Not enough to cover a bet that big.

- que:
  - What's the problem?
  ans:
  - He wants to put a half million on Syphon.

- que:
  - Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure I know it.

- que:
  - Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?
  ans:
  - He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. I got you one of each. He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.

- que:
  - How ya doin'?
  ans:
  - Nothin' yet. I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

- que:
  - What are the odds on Syphon?
  ans:
  - A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Gondorff asked me to look after ya.

- que:
  - Hi there, Snyder. Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?
  ans:
  - You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.

- que:
  - We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
  ans:
  - Yes, a ticket to Chicago.

- que:
  - Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good. Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
  ans:
  - But I got a train to make.

- que:
  - But what about all these other people?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.

- que:
  - You done?
  ans:
  - Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.

- que:
  - Where's June today?
  ans:
  - She don't work here no more. I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.

- que:
  - Where you goin'?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Depends what train I get on.

- que:
  - What time you get off work here?
  ans:
  - 2,00 A.M.

- que:
  - You doin' anything tonight?
  ans:
  - Yeh, sleepin'.

- que:
  - Look, I don't have time to fuck around. There's somebody out there I don't need to see. You got a fire escape or anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What the hell for?
  ans:
  - Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.

- que:
  - What does this guy want?
  ans:
  - He'd like to kill me.

- que:
  - You sure it'll be one of these two?
  ans:
  - No. They're just the only ones we know of.

- que:
  - All right, when?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow, after 4,00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.

- que:
  - Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it?
  ans:
  - He cheats.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - He hired a dame to take it from ya.

- que:
  - Then why the rat?
  ans:
  - Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger. I want you to help me break him.

- que:
  - What's the matter? You gotta get back to Shaw?
  ans:
  - Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.

- que:
  - That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
  ans:
  - Maybe a couple million.

- que:
  - And you were gonna pay me back?
  ans:
  - I am after this race.

- que:
  - Well, what did I tell ya?
  ans:
  - You're a lucky man, all right.

- que:
  - You stayin' in or not?
  ans:
  - I'm in.

- que:
  - You got the 400 grand yet?
  ans:
  - Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.

- que:
  - What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
  ans:
  - If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.

- que:
  - What happened to your face?
  ans:
  - Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th. She got me with her ring.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I didn't get the bet down in time.

- que:
  - How am I gonna do that?
  ans:
  - I don't know, figure something out.

- que:
  - You want a drink or something?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
  ans:
  - I'll make parole.

- que:
  - Will you wait until the chump is played?
  ans:
  - Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.

- que:
  - All right, Riley. What the hell happened?
  ans:
  - We missed him.

- que:
  - Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He took it hard.

- que:
  - We'll take it. You manage the building at the end of the alley?
  ans:
  - For fifteen years.

- que:
  - I'll need a room over there that faces this way. How much a week?
  ans:
  - Only rents by the month. Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.

- que:
  - Do ya know him or don't ya?
  ans:
  - Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

- que:
  - Well we do. He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
  ans:
  - Sure. Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.

- que:
  - Why don't you pick him up yourself?
  ans:
  - Wouldn't that be too bad. You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.

- que:
  - What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
  ans:
  - He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

- que:
  - Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about this Rosebreen?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Don't know a thing.

- que:
  - What's your next step, Nick?
  ans:
  - Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.

- que:
  - He was?
  ans:
  - Yes. He admitted it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You know how they are... sex...

- que:
  - Is that what it means?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
  ans:
  - It's all right.

- que:
  - What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... What is it?
  ans:
  - Just a minute...

- que:
  - Any luck?
  ans:
  - He's just around the corner.

- que:
  - Why did that man want to kill him?
  ans:
  - Said he stole his invention.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Another young man.

- que:
  - Mind if I look around?
  ans:
  - Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You're high enough.

- que:
  - How are you?.... Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.... No, she isn't here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the message?
  ans:
  - Give it to me.

- que:
  - What is it? Has he found him?
  ans:
  - Do you know where he's living? Oh.... Well, at least I'm glad he's all right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - He's all right. Isn't that enough?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
  ans:
  - I won't have you hounding him any more for money.

- que:
  - I didn't.
  ans:
  - Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?

- que:
  - Then what are you hiding?
  ans:
  - It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.

- que:
  - Is your father still in there?
  ans:
  - He's waiting for you.

- que:
  - Did he tell you where he was going?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't say.

- que:
  - Aren't you Nick Charles?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Not that scrawny little....?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - was fascinated with you.... a real live detective.... You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they true?
  ans:
  - Probably not.

- que:
  - Your father?
  ans:
  - No. The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.

- que:
  - We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks. Why don't you drop around?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where did you hit her?
  ans:
  - Why... in the heart.

- que:
  - Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
  ans:
  - She fell down.

- que:
  - Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Which way did she fall?
  ans:
  - She... she fell over backwards.

- que:
  - Where did you get this gun?
  ans:
  - He's been dead for three months.

- que:
  - Forgive me. How are you?
  ans:
  - Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.

- que:
  - What would your mother say to that?
  ans:
  - This is my wedding.

- que:
  - He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
  ans:
  - If you think it'll be all right.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.

- que:
  - A new invention?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.

- que:
  - It's a promise?
  ans:
  - That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.

- que:
  - How's your brother?
  ans:
  - He's all right.

- que:
  - I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
  ans:
  - You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.

- que:
  - He's a brave man.
  ans:
  - Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow... ...has he seen the whole family?

- que:
  - Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
  ans:
  - Only in bad weather.

- que:
  - Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I come down and see it?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
  ans:
  - He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.

- que:
  - Did they find any clues... a gun or fingerprints or anything?
  ans:
  - Not a thing.

- que:
  - I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
  ans:
  - Was there much blood?

- que:
  - Well, I've got my alibi. I was at the Public Library. Where were you?
  ans:
  - Yes. I might not have been shot.

- que:
  - What's he want of you?
  ans:
  - Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.

- que:
  - What's that to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What'd he think it was to you?
  ans:
  - Ask him. I don't know.

- que:
  - Have you got a pistol permit?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - This gun yours?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who's is it?
  ans:
  - I'll have to try to remember.

- que:
  - You mean about that gun?
  ans:
  - That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted - the - Don't waste time talking about that.

- que:
  - Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
  ans:
  - Man to man, I'm not.

- que:
  - What about the suicide?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.

- que:
  - No proof?
  ans:
  - Nothing yet to cinch it.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.

- que:
  - I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
  ans:
  - They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.

- que:
  - What about Jorgensen?
  ans:
  - I'll check on that. I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.

- que:
  - What about this Nunheim?
  ans:
  - Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.

- que:
  - Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
  ans:
  - I think we're on the right track.

- que:
  - Who're you calling?
  ans:
  - I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.

- que:
  - Get anything?
  ans:
  - She's ready to talk. It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.

- que:
  - \"D.W.R.\" That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
  ans:
  - Rosebreen.

- que:
  - Could this be him?
  ans:
  - I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.

- que:
  - What're you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'll take care of him.

- que:
  - Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
  ans:
  - Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.

- que:
  - You mean that body-----?
  ans:
  - --was Wynant's.

- que:
  - When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
  ans:
  - Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Seen any signs of it, Bill?
  ans:
  - I said he hadn't written me.

- que:
  - Oh, then you did hear from him?
  ans:
  - Well....

- que:
  - Well, what?
  ans:
  - He telephoned me today.

- que:
  - When was that?
  ans:
  - About three.

- que:
  - Did you go?
  ans:
  - Yes. But he didn't show up.

- que:
  - Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
  ans:
  - I didn't know they had a fight.

- que:
  - You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
  ans:
  - Why yes.

- que:
  - Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.

- que:
  - What kind of clothes was he wearing?
  ans:
  - A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.

- que:
  - Do you think that Wynant did it?
  ans:
  - Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.

- que:
  - What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
  ans:
  - She drives me nuts. She's been ragging me all day.

- que:
  - Want to take a poke at him?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean you, Mister.

- que:
  - Sit down! We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole. Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
  ans:
  - I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant. Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here. She'd remember.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Just what I said I'd do.

- que:
  - Who's that man?
  ans:
  - He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.

- que:
  - Don't worry. You won't see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
  ans:
  - No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.

- que:
  - What bonds?
  ans:
  - The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.

- que:
  - No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them?
  ans:
  - What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....

- que:
  - Hello .... give me .... Well .... ?
  ans:
  - I never had it.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Oh, hello. Come on in.

- que:
  - Did you get my money?
  ans:
  - I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.

- que:
  - Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is Julia going with you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - But what if you need more money?
  ans:
  - I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you. Goodbye.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Hello, Macaulay. Come in.

- que:
  - Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
  ans:
  - She usually is. Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er - --sleuthing for her.

- que:
  - What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
  ans:
  - You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.

- que:
  - No word at all?
  ans:
  - He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money... I give it to her and she gives it to him.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - I hate to bother you when you're laid up.

- que:
  - What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
  ans:
  - Slim.

- que:
  - Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
  ans:
  - But it must have been Wynant. I should have known if it weren't his voice.

- que:
  - Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
  ans:
  - What about it, Tanner. Isn't that the truth?

- que:
  - Well, don't you?
  ans:
  - You're always teasing.

- que:
  - Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
  ans:
  - Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.

- que:
  - Dorothy! Is she here?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Where's Gilbert?
  ans:
  - I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.

- que:
  - You did... where?
  ans:
  - Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.

- que:
  - Oh, did he? What did he say?
  ans:
  - Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.

- que:
  - Why tell me?
  ans:
  - That's all swell. Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - This is your party.

- que:
  - If you like 'em like that.
  ans:
  - Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?

- que:
  - You got types?
  ans:
  - Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.

- que:
  - By the way, how is your father's side?
  ans:
  - Much better, thanks.

- que:
  - How many drinks have you had?
  ans:
  - Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.

- que:
  - What hit me?
  ans:
  - That last Martini.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Santa Claus.

- que:
  - I'd better order some food. That sounds like an interesting case. Wouldn't you like to take it?
  ans:
  - I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.

- que:
  - What are you drinking?
  ans:
  - Rye.

- que:
  - Where did you get that?
  ans:
  - She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.

- que:
  - What are you going to do with it?
  ans:
  - She didn't tell me a thing.

- que:
  - Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can't you get to sleep?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
  ans:
  - Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.

- que:
  - All right... shoot! I mean... what's on your mind?
  ans:
  - It's all right. It just grazed me.

- que:
  - Well, quick -- get into bed. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Sure -- I don't even feel it.

- que:
  - Want a drink?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well, didn't you?
  ans:
  - I never saw that before.

- que:
  - Who gave it to you?
  ans:
  - You did.

- que:
  - Finished with these?
  ans:
  - Yes. I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Macaulay.

- que:
  - Aren't you hot in that?
  ans:
  - I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.

- que:
  - Is that another Christmas present?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did I give it to you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.

- que:
  - But Wynant --- ?
  ans:
  - I don't believe he did it.

- que:
  - Why don't you?
  ans:
  - I'm going to take Asta for a walk.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I've got hunch. I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.

- que:
  - You mean, he might be hiding there?
  ans:
  - I don't know... This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.

- que:
  - Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
  ans:
  - He was down in the shop.

- que:
  - Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
  ans:
  - But they all said it was Rosebreen's.

- que:
  - What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
  ans:
  - Several things. Hello, Fred. We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.

- que:
  - Well, don't they?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How long has he been dead?
  ans:
  - Couple of months anyway.

- que:
  - Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
  ans:
  - No. Nobody but you.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I don't want to go off half-cocked.

- que:
  - I've got a lulu -- why?
  ans:
  - I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.

- que:
  - Who do you think did it?
  ans:
  - Mimi...

- que:
  - I can't wait any longer. Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is that true?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why are you saying it?
  ans:
  - It's the only way it makes sense.

- que:
  - Come on out, now. He won't hurt you. Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
  ans:
  - No, Mr. Charles.

- que:
  - How did you get in here?
  ans:
  - I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.

- que:
  - You worked here?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.

- que:
  - Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
  ans:
  - That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.

- que:
  - Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
  ans:
  - Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
  ans:
  - No... no.

- que:
  - You his wife?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know. That time he caught me was a accident. I led with my right.

- que:
  - Bonds, sir?
  ans:
  - I'm fired.

- que:
  - Who fired you?
  ans:
  - You did.

- que:
  - You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
  ans:
  - Y-yes.

- que:
  - Where were you going?
  ans:
  - Baghdad.

- que:
  - What's in the other direction?
  ans:
  - This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.

- que:
  - Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
  ans:
  - Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.

- que:
  - What's it say?
  ans:
  - Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.

- que:
  - You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking?
  ans:
  - Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.

- que:
  - What are we going to do!?
  ans:
  - We're going to keep driving.

- que:
  - What kind of mine?
  ans:
  - I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.

- que:
  - We've got rope?
  ans:
  - For climbing.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What do you figure it to be?
  ans:
  - Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.

- que:
  - What am I supposed to do?
  ans:
  - Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.

- que:
  - It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
  ans:
  - You ready?

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.

- que:
  - What if I do?
  ans:
  - No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.

- que:
  - Suppose I don't go for that?
  ans:
  - Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.

- que:
  - What about Jaeger?
  ans:
  - Thanks for taking care of this for me.

- que:
  - You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
  ans:
  - Just keep quiet.

- que:
  - So you can give us away?
  ans:
  - Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you.

- que:
  - It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
  ans:
  - At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.

- que:
  - Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
  ans:
  - What are you doing?

- que:
  - Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
  ans:
  - I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.

- que:
  - Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
  ans:
  - I did it! I got the box open.

- que:
  - You think?
  ans:
  - They finally start the ground war, and where are we? Same place we've been since we got here. Securing freedom for the dirt.

- que:
  - Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
  ans:
  - Christ! Wes, tell him. You know this stuff.

- que:
  - Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes?
  ans:
  - But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.

- que:
  - You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
  ans:
  - Third. What you're going to do with your third.

- que:
  - What are you going to do with your third?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.

- que:
  - And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
  ans:
  - I didn't miss it. I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.

- que:
  - What do we do with the Humvee?
  ans:
  - We leave it.

- que:
  - What!?
  ans:
  - Mine.

- que:
  - Just be cool.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - It's a mine, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Just relax.

- que:
  - How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
  ans:
  - We're going to get off, all right. We'll get you off of there. Just...be cool.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - Me and Wes are just going to talk.

- que:
  - Why you got to move away to talk!?
  ans:
  - We're going to be right over here.

- que:
  - How's this going to work?
  ans:
  - Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.

- que:
  - You're not losing trust, are you?
  ans:
  - Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.

- que:
  - I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. We're in this together, understand?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I understand. Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find. That's a sweet deal.

- que:
  - What are they doing here?
  ans:
  - Well, it's Iraq. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.

- que:
  - What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
  ans:
  - They're doing more than slapping.

- que:
  - Where is it? Where'd it go?
  ans:
  - Stay low.

- que:
  - Where the hell is it!?
  ans:
  - Just stay down.

- que:
  - What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
  ans:
  - We're not going to do anything.

- que:
  - Think there might be more Iraqis?
  ans:
  - Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.

- que:
  - What does it look like I'm doing?
  ans:
  - It looks like you're not doing anything.

- que:
  - Is it dead?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

- que:
  - We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
  ans:
  - He's not going to leave us.

- que:
  - Why do I have to stay down here?
  ans:
  - Jesus, Jaeger.

- que:
  - What are we going to do? How are we going to find our way back!?
  ans:
  - We'll find our way.

- que:
  - How!?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - First Wes, now you?
  ans:
  - I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.

- que:
  - Is it all right if I stand up?
  ans:
  - I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that.

- que:
  - You still got a map on you?
  ans:
  - What? Yeah.

- que:
  - Epps?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Wonder how the war's going?
  ans:
  - It's got to be going better than this..

- que:
  - You sure you want me too?
  ans:
  - I pick that way.

- que:
  - What do you figure it is?
  ans:
  - Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.

- que:
  - Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
  ans:
  - Couldn't be Syria. We couldn't have gone that far north. It's got to be Saudi. Come on.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Well, we should identify ourselves.

- que:
  - They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark.
  ans:
  - What did you say?

- que:
  - What are we going to do?
  ans:
  - Slip out your M-16.

- que:
  - And then what?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He didn't have a uniform on. He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.

- que:
  - To where?
  ans:
  - Sun rises in the East. We go the opposite direction. May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

- que:
  - What do you make of them?
  ans:
  - Shi'ites, I think.

- que:
  - Is that good, or bad?
  ans:
  - I don't know. They killed Wes.

- que:
  - ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
  ans:
  - Why haven't they killed us!?

- que:
  - With what? Against how many?
  ans:
  - We can't just sit here waiting to die.

- que:
  - Me? I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
  ans:
  - ...Wes...?

- que:
  - Can you ride a horse?
  ans:
  - No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.

- que:
  - Which way do we go!?
  ans:
  - We go this way.

- que:
  - When did you make the switch?
  ans:
  - But...

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.

- que:
  - How do we do that?
  ans:
  - You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.

- que:
  - Why do I have to lie in the road?
  ans:
  - Somebody has to.

- que:
  - Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
  ans:
  - Then I'm a rich man.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking about taking a trip.

- que:
  - Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How the hell should I know?
  ans:
  - Australia.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.

- que:
  - Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
  ans:
  - Just...want to be ready when we do.

- que:
  - Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
  ans:
  - The photos.

- que:
  - Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
  ans:
  - Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.

- que:
  - A headache?
  ans:
  - Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.

- que:
  - When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
  ans:
  - I'm saying don't do it accidently.

- que:
  - Spanish wasn't hard enough?
  ans:
  - I thought it would be good to know.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Now you need me.

- que:
  - For real? A treasure?
  ans:
  - And you're the guy who's going to open it.

- que:
  - You get it yet?
  ans:
  - Naw, nothing.

- que:
  - You really think there's a treasure inside?
  ans:
  - I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.

- que:
  - Yeah. So?
  ans:
  - That's in two days.

- que:
  - What's your point, Wes? You have a point?
  ans:
  - We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.

- que:
  - You ever think about dying?
  ans:
  - Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.

- que:
  - You ever think about it? You ever worry?
  ans:
  - At-at-at-at-at.

- que:
  - Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
  ans:
  - We...we could go home with something else.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - With...with millions. Millions of dollars.

- que:
  - Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
  ans:
  - If! If there's a treasure.

- que:
  - Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.

- que:
  - You know what I'm doing with my half?
  ans:
  - This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.

- que:
  - So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
  ans:
  - ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.

- que:
  - Is there anything you do know?
  ans:
  - I know you're a pussy. I know that.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - We have to do something.

- que:
  - Think we can make it?
  ans:
  - We make it, or we go back empty handed.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Lines up with the map and the photos.

- que:
  - You down?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we're down.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing!?
  ans:
  - I think we found something.

- que:
  - He lived through that?
  ans:
  - Maybe we should give him some water.

- que:
  - You want to say some words?
  ans:
  - You're going to burn up in those.

- que:
  - Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
  ans:
  - Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers.

- que:
  - Cortex bonding....possible temporary. Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
  ans:
  - Stress category.

- que:
  - Correct. Origin?
  ans:
  - Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.

- que:
  - Violation?
  ans:
  - Drug evasion with....

- que:
  - A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
  ans:
  - Permant cortex bond.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - See if you can get a reading on tactal retention. Try to estimate it without a meter reading.

- que:
  - 4732...?
  ans:
  - Too low.

- que:
  - No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
  ans:
  - 4000 degrees is usually the point of....?

- que:
  - What's this? Why did you change it?
  ans:
  - You've seen enough.

- que:
  - What did you get?
  ans:
  - I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Now.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - He wants me to come to his quarters.

- que:
  - Then why did you bring it up?
  ans:
  - I didn't. You asked me about the card. You're going to get us into trouble.

- que:
  - Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
  ans:
  - What time is it?

- que:
  - What are you doing here? Is anything wrong?
  ans:
  - No....I though I'm afraid.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - AH UGH.

- que:
  - I thought you were through with it!
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What's going on....what are you doing?
  ans:
  - We're leaving.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're leaving.

- que:
  - Who? Who's leaving?
  ans:
  - THX and me.

- que:
  - How far did you go? Was it cold?
  ans:
  - You have nothing to fear. You're safe again.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though. I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I want you for my roommate.

- que:
  - Where's LUH?
  ans:
  - It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm leaving.

- que:
  - When?.....How?
  ans:
  - Right now.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I was lost.

- que:
  - ...and you're not lost now?
  ans:
  - No, I...

- que:
  - Which way?
  ans:
  - That way.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Who? Me?...I don't know.

- que:
  - What kind of answer is that?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What have you done, Cut your hand?
  ans:
  - Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.

- que:
  - All right...
  ans:
  - No?

- que:
  - Where's LUH?
  ans:
  - Look more closely.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.

- que:
  - And you are...?
  ans:
  - Officer Reilly, vice.

- que:
  - How's the print coming?
  ans:
  - Damn.

- que:
  - Coffee, Mike?
  ans:
  - No thanks, Bev.

- que:
  - Aren't you on suspension?
  ans:
  - Just do it.

- que:
  - Where did you get this?
  ans:
  - Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.

- que:
  - What're you talking about?
  ans:
  - When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.

- que:
  - What was-? Why...?
  ans:
  - That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.

- que:
  - We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - So you're the \"Device Squad\"... and you defuse \"devices\"?
  ans:
  - Treat. We treat devices.

- que:
  - Anything else I should know?
  ans:
  - Don't push it, slick.

- que:
  - She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
  ans:
  - Only once, at Redstone.

- que:
  - Then let's go see what they missed.
  ans:
  - Where...?

- que:
  - I don't know. You tell me?
  ans:
  - An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.

- que:
  - Cream of the crop, huh? You?
  ans:
  - Sounds like terrorist heaven.

- que:
  - Just how easy is it to build a... device?
  ans:
  - Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...

- que:
  - How long are we going to stay?
  ans:
  - Til we get a better lead.

- que:
  - Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Why do you do it?
  ans:
  - So cut both.

- que:
  - Which one's which?
  ans:
  - I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You don't have to talk about it.

- que:
  - Your partner?
  ans:
  - I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.

- que:
  - Ex-girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Be right back.

- que:
  - Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
  ans:
  - What's up?

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.

- que:
  - Would you?
  ans:
  - No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...

- que:
  - Fuck factor?
  ans:
  - Off the scale.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - Talk to me. Let's assess.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.

- que:
  - Which one's which?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What... ?
  ans:
  - When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.

- que:
  - Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
  ans:
  - Easy, guys.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Call upstairs, see what you can find out.

- que:
  - Whadaya mean?
  ans:
  - It's from an IRA.

- que:
  - \"Punks\", huh?
  ans:
  - Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.

- que:
  - We work fast enough for you?
  ans:
  - Political.

- que:
  - Any word?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.

- que:
  - Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Coming?
  ans:
  - We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.

- que:
  - Computer device?
  ans:
  - Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.

- que:
  - Glass, what is it?
  ans:
  - I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.

- que:
  - What do ay say?
  ans:
  - Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.

- que:
  - Then why tell me?
  ans:
  - People are dying.

- que:
  - I know. I warned them.
  ans:
  - You okay?

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Security.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing... just tired.

- que:
  - Why are we stopping here?
  ans:
  - We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.

- que:
  - Shut up! Who is this?
  ans:
  - Drop it.

- que:
  - What the hell was that?
  ans:
  - A ticking bomb...

- que:
  - Prints?
  ans:
  - Nothing so far.

- que:
  - What about the ballistics report?
  ans:
  - Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.

- que:
  - Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
  ans:
  - What the hell's going on?

- que:
  - How're you guys doing?
  ans:
  - Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.

- que:
  - Pooch, can you move it?
  ans:
  - That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.

- que:
  - You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
  ans:
  - One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.

- que:
  - Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
  ans:
  - What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.

- que:
  - What was it this time?
  ans:
  - She wanted to cook me breakfast.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, just a nick ...

- que:
  - Vice cop on a homicide?
  ans:
  - Captain assigned me to assist you.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - IRA - instant retirement account.

- que:
  - So what're we looking for?
  ans:
  - Someone who smokes French cigarettes.

- que:
  - I'll do it.
  ans:
  - Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's detonation cord, for a bomb.

- que:
  - I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
  ans:
  - Report on the case so far.

- que:
  - She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
  ans:
  - Glass, you're to stand by with your team.

- que:
  - Reilly, what the hell are you-?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
  ans:
  - Well, have you found it?

- que:
  - Yes, M'sieu Laval?
  ans:
  - Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.

- que:
  - Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
  ans:
  - GASTON erect in sweater, arms folded.

- que:
  - Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
  ans:
  - Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.

- que:
  - Niente!
  ans:
  - And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?

- que:
  - What did you talk about?
  ans:
  - About tonsils.

- que:
  - Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
  ans:
  - Yes, M'sieu Filiba?

- que:
  - But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question, Have you ever been in Venice?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No ... Have you ever been in Vienna?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Amsterdam?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Constantinople?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And harems ... ?
  ans:
  - All.

- que:
  - Smart. London, eh?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.

- que:
  - If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
  ans:
  - I would start with cocktails.

- que:
  - And, waiter--you see that moon?
  ans:
  - Yes, Baron.

- que:
  - But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
  ans:
  - You can trust me.

- que:
  - Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
  ans:
  - I am only insinuating that you are nervous.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You say I am a crook.

- que:
  - Do you know King Boris?
  ans:
  - No--no.

- que:
  - Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
  ans:
  - I would like to.

- que:
  - That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses-- his head.
  ans:
  - Disappointed?

- que:
  - The pepper, too?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - Last year? It can't be that long.
  ans:
  - What time is it?

- que:
  - Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace and made it into a lamp for my night table?
  ans:
  - Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.

- que:
  - Sweetheart, what day is today?
  ans:
  - The fourteenth of May.

- que:
  - Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
  ans:
  - Spanish passports?

- que:
  - Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
  ans:
  - Well, see you at the Berlin Express.

- que:
  - Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
  ans:
  - By the way, how is your German?

- que:
  - Don't you realize--
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You like that statue?
  ans:
  - Not particularly.

- que:
  - Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
  ans:
  - Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.

- que:
  - Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
  ans:
  - The pleasure is mine, madame.

- que:
  - What's wrong now?
  ans:
  - Peaches and cream.

- que:
  - Do you realize I have light eyes?
  ans:
  - But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.

- que:
  - Do you know my first name?
  ans:
  - No. What is it? Tell me.

- que:
  - It is beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
  ans:
  - And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.

- que:
  - What would you do if you were my secretary?
  ans:
  - The same thing.

- que:
  - Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
  ans:
  - I'll be delighted.

- que:
  - What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
  ans:
  - Beautiful.

- que:
  - Hair?
  ans:
  - Marvelous.

- que:
  - But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
  ans:
  - Lipstick?

- que:
  - Talk? About me--about us?
  ans:
  - Precisely.

- que:
  - Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
  ans:
  - No--yours, madame.

- que:
  - I believe you.
  ans:
  - So you think you can get me?

- que:
  - Then why do you want to go?
  ans:
  - Because I want to make it tough for you.

- que:
  - When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't say anything--I would act.

- que:
  - Call the police?
  ans:
  - Instantly.

- que:
  - But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
  ans:
  - You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.

- que:
  - Adolph?
  ans:
  - Adolph J. Giron.

- que:
  - And you expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.

- que:
  - Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something. Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
  ans:
  - Yes, Madame Colet?

- que:
  - What is it, madame?
  ans:
  - I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.

- que:
  - To M'sieu Laval?
  ans:
  - He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.

- que:
  - Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
  ans:
  - You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?

- que:
  - Two lumps, madame?
  ans:
  - Please! Thank you.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Well--uh--yes and no.

- que:
  - I think you'd better go.
  ans:
  - Yes, madame?

- que:
  - That's true.
  ans:
  - Ever had a romance with a crook?

- que:
  - Well, he was in the navy.
  ans:
  - Then why did you do it?

- que:
  - Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
  ans:
  - Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.

- que:
  - How much time?
  ans:
  - An hour, two at most.

- que:
  - You're certain?
  ans:
  - Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

- que:
  - Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.

- que:
  - You are, Lewis. You rolling?
  ans:
  - Shit.

- que:
  - Don't you mean work me?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.

- que:
  - No, trust me, you want to take this call.
  ans:

  ans:
  - You wouldn'ta jumped.

- que:
  - So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
  ans:

  - Are you nervous?
  ans:
  - Au contraire, mon cher.

- que:
  - Could it have damaged the ship?
  ans:
  - It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.

- que:
  - Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
  ans:
  - I didn't. I just realized I already knew.

  ans:
  - I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.

  - How can you put this on my shoulders?
  ans:
  - It's so unfair.

  - Guess again, copper.

- que:
  - We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
  ans:
  - Fine--I'll be glad to.

- que:
  - Could I see you a minute?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.

  - What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
  ans:

  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Well, I can't.

- que:
  - At seven-thirty?
  ans:

  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - A lot of things I'd like to forget.

- que:
  - You mean that?
  ans:
  - Don't let's talk about it.

- que:
  - Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
  ans:
  - This time I'm really glad you showed up.

- que:
  - I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
  ans:

  ans:
  - We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?

  - You don't think--?
  ans:
  - Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.

  ans:
  - Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.

- que:
  - How're the tips?
  ans:
  - A dollar forty.

  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.

  ans:
  - Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.

  - Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
  ans:

- que:
  - She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
  ans:
  - Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?

- que:
  - I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. Is she entertaining you?
  ans:
  - I should say not.

- que:
  - Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but that--Do I make myself clear?
  ans:
  - Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.

- que:
  - Here you are, sir.

  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - I can see where I won't talk much to you.

- que:
  - Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
  ans:
  - This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.

- que:
  - Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
  ans:
  - She's in New York.

- que:
  - Who won?
  ans:
  - Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.

- que:
  - Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
  ans:
  - Let me see now--Don't tell me-- You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.

  - Will be--as soon as the ship sails.

- que:
  - Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo-- Get out of here.
  ans:

  ans:
  - Like it?

- que:
  - Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
  ans:
  - No--Inexperienced-- A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.

- que:
  - I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
  ans:
  - Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.

- que:
  - Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up right guys?
  ans:
  - Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.

- que:
  - I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
  ans:
  - Very serious?

- que:
  - Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
  ans:
  - Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.

- que:
  - Meaning what?
  ans:
  - You don't shoot squirrels.

  ans:
  - I wish I could.

- que:
  - That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire. How about Ned?
  ans:
  - He's all right.

- que:
  - Of course not-- --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
  ans:
  - You can't bluff me any more.

- que:
  - I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it. What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Just smile again and be reasonable. I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.

- que:
  - Congratulations.
  ans:
  - --and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?

- que:
  - Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
  ans:
  - Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?

- que:
  - And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.

- que:
  - Thirty one's and two ten's?
  ans:
  - Nothin-- --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.

  - Do you think Lother could have seen it?
  ans:
  - Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.

- que:
  - Aren't the roses beautiful?
  ans:
  - I'm all right.

  - Everything in order, sir? What are you doing here, my lad?
  ans:

- que:
  - By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?

  ans:
  - ...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing, There's no gold down there.

- que:
  - What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
  ans:
  - I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.

- que:

- que:
  - His newspapers?
  ans:
  - More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

- que:
  - Political considerations?
  ans:
  - To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing. In fact, I was never here.

- que:
  - Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
  ans:
  - Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?

  ans:
  - Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing, Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.

- que:
  - Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
  ans:
  - That's reassuring.

- que:
  - Something with an engine? Not oars?
  ans:
  - Step into my office.

- que:
  - Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat?
  ans:
  - Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok. Should have seen his rose garden, Blooms the size of hand grenades.

- que:
  - Natalya?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

  ans:
  - Hell. The CIA built that club.

- que:
  - Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred - What happened?
  ans:
  - He tied one on.

- que:
  - I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
  ans:
  - I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.

- que:
  - ... Does this do anything?
  ans:
  - Depends what number you write.

- que:
  - Married?
  ans:
  - Happily.

  - Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.

- que:
  - And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
  ans:
  - Insurance. Lloyds of London.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.

- que:
  - Do I have to do everything around here?
  ans:
  - I hope so.

- que:
  - No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
  ans:
  - And what do you call this?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.

- que:
  - Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
  ans:
  - This has got to be a mistake.

- que:
  - ... How did you get into marine salvage?
  ans:
  - My father left me the business.

- que:
  - What the hell does that do?
  ans:
  - Cleans dirt. Let's go.

- que:
  - Down?
  ans:
  - Up.

- que:
  - Are you listening to me?
  ans:
  - Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.

- que:
  - Don't say it.
  ans:
  - ... We have time for that?

- que:
  - Is this - like - a normal day for you?
  ans:
  - It's a lousy job, but - The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.

- que:
  - Another reason? Did I miss something?
  ans:
  - You insist on calling all the shots. And by the way, I am not a helpless girl.

- que:
  - If not?
  ans:
  - We blast through.

- que:
  - Sleep well?
  ans:
  - Next time, I do the driving.

- que:
  - ... Yes?
  ans:
  - Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.

- que:
  - ... Yes?
  ans:
  - First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.

  - And when might that be?
  ans:
  - Now.

  - Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
  ans:
  - Of course. Minister Johnstone.

  - ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?

- que:
  - .... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
  ans:
  - ...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.

- que:
  - What do you make of all this?
  ans:
  - It doesn't quite add up.

- que:
  - Sabotage?
  ans:
  - A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.

- que:
  - ... And what do you call these?
  ans:
  - Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.

- que:
  - We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
  ans:
  - Mandarin. You jerk. I'm late. I have to get dressed.

- que:
  - I am. What do you want?
  ans:
  - You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.

  ans:
  - Junior spends time with his child.

- que:
  - Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How come you're not wearing my shoes?
  ans:
  - They're too big.

- que:
  - When are you boys going to fix that roof?
  ans:
  - Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.

- que:
  - When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
  ans:
  - You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.

  - Like muddy waters?
  ans:
  - It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.

- que:
  - You were in hell?
  ans:
  - I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.

- que:
  - Do you think you won?
  ans:
  - It was nip and tuck.

- que:
  - And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?

  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
  ans:
  - Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was furious, you can see it in the photograph.

  - Didn't you know he made things?

  ans:
  - Arnie, this is crazy.

- que:
  - What is he being charged with?
  ans:
  - Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.

- que:
  - How much do I pay him?
  ans:
  - I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.

- que:
  - Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
  ans:
  - Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.

- que:
  - It's the same. What happened to what they gave you?
  ans:
  - It's Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.

- que:
  - So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
  ans:
  - I was just waiting for the right time.

- que:
  - And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
  ans:
  - I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything else.

- que:
  - So my wife is lying?
  ans:
  - Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.

- que:
  - Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
  ans:
  - This is different.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.

- que:
  - I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar. It's this General, Salazar. At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
  ans:
  - How long have you known?

- que:
  - Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
  ans:
  - You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.

- que:
  - Oh, it is?
  ans:
  - Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.

- que:
  - Should we bring the police into this?
  ans:
  - No, not yet.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.

- que:
  - Did you meet the President?
  ans:
  - Honey, your father knows the President.

- que:
  - Did you tell Dad?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Are you going to?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Just watching you.

- que:
  - What if every country legalized at the same time?
  ans:
  - Somehow, I don't see that happening.

- que:
  - Will we get invited to the White House?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How long's the job?
  ans:
  - It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.

- que:
  - Where is it? Where are the drugs? Where are they?
  ans:
  - Fuck you. I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.

- que:
  - Live with your parents?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Parents still together?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you work?
  ans:
  - I volunteer. I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.

- que:
  - In school?
  ans:
  - Cincinnati Country Day.

- que:
  - Private?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How are your grades?
  ans:
  - I'm third in my class.

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - I get A's. All A's.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just watch.

- que:
  - What is this, like freebase?
  ans:
  - Not like. It is.

- que:
  - Then here's a little bump.
  ans:
  - Have you done your homework, honey?

- que:
  - Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
  ans:
  - I think so. If she didn't she should have. I've only got maybe an hour. Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.

- que:
  - No telltales. Nothing to read. Not touching my face. Not even blinking. No giveaways. How're you feeling?
  ans:
  - I feel good.

- que:
  - No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
  ans:
  - Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.

- que:
  - Who do you work for?
  ans:
  - They're whispering. I can't hear them, but I know it. I smell conspiracy. I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.

- que:
  - You want to make a wager on this?
  ans:
  - You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.

- que:
  - Are you getting this on tape?
  ans:
  - I love my job. I love it. The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What do you think she wants?
  ans:
  - She's your girlfriend. Open it, talk about your kids.

- que:
  - Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life. Why don't you develop a useful skill?
  ans:
  - Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.

- que:
  - What do you think it is?
  ans:
  - Depends who it's from.

- que:
  - What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
  ans:
  - Depends on the state.

- que:
  - Medicinal marijuana initiative. Or am I being cynical?
  ans:
  - I'll put this in the back.

- que:
  - I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
  ans:
  - You may speak.

- que:
  - You're kidding. Can't you shoot him or something?
  ans:
  - I don't really like guns. You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.

- que:
  - When will you do it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl. The security is very tight. There may not be a way.

- que:
  - This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
  ans:
  - I got greedy. I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off. That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.

- que:
  - This is ridiculous. Why is there no elevator?
  ans:
  - When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.

- que:
  - Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
  ans:
  - I hear these stories. Your husband in jail. His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.

- que:
  - My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children. Are you aware of this?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Perhaps I remember something.

- que:
  - Wasn't that General Salazar?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's he doing up here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Something.

- que:
  - Your new friends.
  ans:
  - Who?

- que:
  - Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
  ans:
  - Not this time.

- que:
  - Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
  ans:
  - No, but a lot of other people. You should come. You should come out with us.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Porfirio Madrigal is not dead. I just saw him.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - A place we have, that we know is protected.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Javier Rodriguez.

- que:
  - One question. How did you find about this?
  ans:
  - An informant.

- que:
  - What is the name of your informant?
  ans:
  - It was an anonymous tip.

- que:
  - That's your past. I want to talk about your future. Would you be willing to do something for me?
  ans:
  - If I can.

- que:
  - What is it you want me to do?
  ans:
  - A small thing. Nothing really.

- que:
  - Does this offer include my partner?
  ans:
  - Only if he can be trusted.

- que:
  - The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
  ans:
  - I'm aware of that.

- que:
  - So what's it doing in Tijuana?
  ans:
  - It could mean that, yes.

- que:
  - That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
  ans:
  - It's possible.

- que:
  - Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
  ans:
  - My work keeps me young.

- que:
  - Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
  ans:
  - Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.

- que:
  - Any way we can do it better?
  ans:
  - That triple the amount of stuff is going through.

- que:
  - Just tell me where she is.
  ans:
  - Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?

- que:
  - She's not at that place you sent her?
  ans:
  - I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through. I'm surprised she hasn't called.

- que:
  - Can you tell me anything? Do you have any ideas?
  ans:
  - I don't know what to say.

- que:
  - We sometimes went downtown to score.
  ans:
  - You won't say anything to my parents?

- que:
  - I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand? What is your policy for treating addiction?
  ans:
  - Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.

- que:
  - Like you protected Landry?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
  ans:
  - Salazar's been taken down. He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.

- que:
  - Who are these guys?
  ans:
  - Agents who died in the field.

- que:
  - I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
  ans:
  - No. On you go.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.

- que:
  - Well, why didn't you bring them?
  ans:
  - Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.

- que:
  - I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
  ans:
  - I'll be right after you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've no fucking cigarettes.

- que:
  - Buy yourself that island in the sun?
  ans:
  - For four fucking grand? One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Diane.

- que:
  - Where are you going, Diane?
  ans:
  - I'm going home.

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - It's where I live.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.

- que:
  - Right. You can't sleep here.
  ans:
  - Eh-

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Out.

- que:
  - Holding hands?
  ans:
  - No, not holding hands.

- que:
  - Can I see you again?
  ans:
  - Certainly not.

- que:
  - Are you clean?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is that a promise, then?
  ans:
  - Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

- que:
  - Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Too young for what?
  ans:
  - It's Iggy Pop.

- que:
  - So why have you told me about it?
  ans:
  - Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.

- que:
  - What? Steady like?
  ans:
  - That's right, 'going steady' for four weeks now.

- que:
  - And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
  ans:
  - Sixteen next month.

- que:
  - So, what's he like?
  ans:
  - Well, he's young and he's healthy.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - He forgot. Useless motherfucker.

- que:
  - What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
  ans:
  - No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.

- que:
  - Eh? How's that?
  ans:
  - I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.

- que:
  - I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
  ans:
  - Tommy, let's put the tape on.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.

- que:
  - What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
  ans:
  - It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.

- que:
  - Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
  ans:
  - You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you \"foot in the door\", as you put it.

- que:
  - Are you getting out much?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Following the game at all?
  ans:
  - No. Me Neither.

- que:
  - You take the test?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - Clear?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - Have you got any gear on you?
  ans:
  - No, I'm clean.

- que:
  - Another dab?
  ans:
  - Would not say no, would not say no.

- que:
  - I chose not to choose life, I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
  ans:
  - Nineteen-sixty-seven.

- que:
  - Running time?
  ans:
  - One hundred and sixteen minutes.

- que:
  - Director?
  ans:
  - Lewis Gilbert.

- que:
  - Eh - Ian Fleming?
  ans:
  - Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.

- que:
  - OK, so who was it, then?
  ans:
  - You can look it up.

- que:
  - Who wrote it?
  ans:
  - But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.

- que:
  - You don't know, do you?
  ans:
  - And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.

- que:
  - The park?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.

- que:
  - Who wrote it?
  ans:
  - Roald Dahl. Fuck me.

- que:
  - Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
  ans:
  - All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.

- que:
  - What about The Untouchables?
  ans:
  - I don't rate that at all.

- que:
  - Despite the Academy award?
  ans:
  - That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.

- que:
  - Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - That's your theory?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.

- que:
  - Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
  ans:
  - Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Allison?
  ans:
  - Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know.

- que:
  - When are you going to visit him?
  ans:
  - Don't know. Maybe Thursday.

- que:
  - You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
  ans:
  - You're all hear.

- que:
  - Why would I want to sell my passport?
  ans:
  - It was just an idea.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.

- que:
  - What was your price?
  ans:
  - Four Grand.

- que:
  - But you don't have the money?
  ans:
  - We're two thousand short.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.

- que:
  - What's on the menu this evening?
  ans:
  - Your favourite dish.

- que:
  - Your usual table, sir?
  ans:
  - Why, thank you.

- que:
  - And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
  ans:
  - Stick it on my tab.

- que:
  - Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
  ans:
  - There.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - It's the great outdoors.

- que:
  - It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
  ans:
  - It's fresh air.

- que:
  - How's it going with Gail?
  ans:
  - No joy yet.

- que:
  - How long is it?
  ans:
  - Six weeks.

- que:
  - Where did she come up with that?
  ans:
  - She read it in Cosmopolitan.

- que:
  - Six weeks and no sex?
  ans:
  - I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.

- que:
  - So what's it going to be?
  ans:
  - Well, I've paid for the ticket.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A walk.

- que:
  - Well, what are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.

- que:
  - What do you see as your main strengths?
  ans:
  - I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.

- que:
  - Qual se tu?
  ans:
  - It is I. The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.

- que:
  - This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
  ans:
  - It could. Yes.

- que:
  - Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
  ans:
  - He doubts me.

- que:
  - My pain?
  ans:
  - It runs deep. Share it with me.

- que:
  - Is there a problem, gentlemen?
  ans:
  - My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.

- que:
  - Sulu, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Plotting our new course.

- que:
  - New course? You have no authority. What's going on here?
  ans:
  - Pavel.

- que:
  - Position, Bird of Prey?
  ans:
  - Closing.

- que:
  - What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
  ans:
  - I don't have a clue.

- que:
  - Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
  ans:
  - You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.

- que:
  - Can we have it quiet?
  ans:
  - Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.

- que:
  - Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
  ans:
  - You caught me on my way to the shower.

- que:
  - Have the Klingons responded?
  ans:
  - No, but you can bet they will.

- que:
  - What do you know of my pain?
  ans:
  - Let us explore it together.

- que:
  - Where did you get this power?
  ans:
  - The power was within you.

- que:
  - I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
  ans:
  - Join my quest.

- que:
  - What is it you seek?
  ans:
  - What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.

- que:
  - But how?
  ans:
  - Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.

- que:
  - You told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
  ans:
  - I think you gave me too much time, Captain.

- que:
  - Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it. Which way to the turbo shaft?
  ans:
  - Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.

- que:
  - Why didn't you beep my communicator?
  ans:
  - ER... You forgot to take it with you.

- que:
  - Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
  ans:
  - Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.

- que:
  - Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
  ans:
  - I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.

- que:
  - And that is?
  ans:
  - Because it's there.

- que:
  - MM.?
  ans:
  - I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.

- que:
  - On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
  ans:
  - I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

- que:
  - That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
  ans:
  - \"Pack Up Your Troubles.\"

- que:
  - Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
  ans:
  - I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.

- que:
  - Captain?
  ans:
  - Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.

- que:
  - Yes, Spock?
  ans:
  - Life is not a dream.

- que:
  - Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
  ans:
  - I cannot be certain.

- que:
  - But he does seem familiar?
  ans:
  - He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.

- que:
  - Yes, Captain?
  ans:
  - Be one with the horse.

- que:
  - There, you see? See?
  ans:
  - I have a half brother.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me this before?
  ans:
  - I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.

- que:
  - This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
  ans:
  - He did have pointed ears.

- que:
  - Is what possible?
  ans:
  - That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

- que:
  - Hmmm?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - I believe we are witnessing my birth.

- que:
  - Spock?
  ans:
  - Welcome aboard, Captain.

- que:
  - Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart Spock?
  ans:
  - I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.

- que:
  - I trust your message was received?
  ans:
  - You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

- que:
  - The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
  ans:
  - I don't control minds. I free them.

- que:
  - I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
  ans:
  - No... I didn't.

- que:
  - Your vision?
  ans:
  - Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.

- que:
  - No special conditions?
  ans:
  - No conditions.

- que:
  - What makes you think I won't turn us around?
  ans:
  - Because you, too, must know.

- que:
  - What have I done?
  ans:
  - Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...

- que:
  - \"Let's see what she's got,\" said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
  ans:
  - I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.

- que:
  - Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
  ans:
  - Easy, easy, easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.

- que:
  - He's not?
  ans:
  - No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.

- que:
  - Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk. Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
  ans:
  - No. I will not.

- que:
  - Spock?
  ans:
  - I cannot go with you.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I belong here.

- que:
  - Are you embezzling?
  ans:
  - \"Embezzling\" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey... No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.

- que:
  - You invented Space Paranoids?
  ans:
  - Senior exec.

- que:
  - Dillinger?
  ans:
  - Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...

- que:
  - Uh... got any cinnamon?
  ans:
  - Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.

- que:
  - Your old files -- ?
  ans:
  - And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
  ans:
  - Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...

- que:
  - How's it going upstairs?
  ans:
  - Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.

- que:
  - Did he say why?
  ans:
  - Flynn had Group 7 access.

- que:
  - You call that getting over it?
  ans:
  - I mean I want both of us to go.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - To warn him.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - That Dillinger's on to him.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For being on to Dillinger.

- que:
  - Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
  ans:
  - What -- ?

- que:
  - Alan. Alan Bailey.
  ans:
  - Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?

- que:
  - Yeah...?
  ans:
  - We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.

- que:
  - Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
  ans:
  - Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.

- que:
  - That all you can say?
  ans:
  - No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.

- que:
  - Oh. Anything else?
  ans:
  - Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.

- que:
  - where's your program? Won't it miss you?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - You said it.
  ans:
  - I'm your program?

- que:
  - Let's get outta here.
  ans:
  - So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?

- que:
  - No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up?
  ans:
  - It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.

- que:
  - Flynn?
  ans:
  - Yes. It felt like Flynn.

- que:
  - He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
  ans:
  - It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...

- que:
  - The Pentagon?
  ans:
  - It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.

- que:
  - What do you want with the Pentagon?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't dare.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
  ans:
  - Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I... have come to communicate with my User.

- que:
  - Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
  ans:
  - All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.

- que:
  - Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
  ans:
  - Tanks...coming back. Let's go.

- que:
  - How about over there...that empty memory?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.

- que:
  - Wrote the...?
  ans:
  - It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.

- que:
  - What about our friend - Sark?
  ans:
  - Not us, I hope.

- que:
  - Did we make it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How about you?
  ans:
  - Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...

- que:
  - A User -- in our world?
  ans:
  - Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...

- que:
  - Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
  ans:
  - A little ... Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...

- que:
  - What's wrong with that area?
  ans:
  - Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...

- que:
  - Why? What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Jump.

- que:
  - But... won't you be de-rezzed?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
  ans:
  - You're a...\"guest\" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
  ans:
  - Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?

- que:
  - How 'bout yourself?
  ans:
  - He was disoriented in transport, Tron.

- que:
  - The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
  ans:
  - Well...my home \"sector\" was called Paramus ...

- que:
  - Feel what? You okay?
  ans:
  - Alan-One...

- que:
  - Good luck. You can't even think in here.
  ans:
  - What's goin' on?

- que:
  - Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
  ans:
  - You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.

- que:
  - you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
  ans:
  - Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.

- que:
  - You're getting out of the business?
  ans:
  - Thank. you, Master Control.

- que:
  - We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
  ans:
  - Strategic Air Command.

- que:
  - You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
  ans:
  - He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.

- que:
  - A User?
  ans:
  - Wait...I need that...

- que:
  - The Users...you really think they're still there?
  ans:
  - They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.

- que:
  - You think we can make it there?
  ans:
  - We have to.

- que:
  - Do you know what he's talking about?
  ans:
  - I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.

- que:
  - My quarters.
  ans:
  - How?

- que:
  - Why is everything...like this?
  ans:
  - It's a flat. But wait a micro...

- que:
  - It's something Users do.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - Where's Flynn?
  ans:
  - So I guess you didn't get away

- que:
  - Can you cover me for an hour?
  ans:
  - Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Out.

- que:
  - Where are you off to young lady?
  ans:
  - I have a book report.

- que:
  - Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren't you in class today?
  ans:
  - He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.

- que:
  - Dana, are you listening to me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Dad.

- que:
  - How was school today?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Dad, how come you know the words?
  ans:
  - Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.

- que:
  - Dad. You just think you know everything, don't you?
  ans:
  - And this is a little above market- for a total biscuit like her.

- que:
  - Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?
  ans:
  - Uh huh. Right here in river city.

- que:
  - Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Switching to sub-vocal. Gib, you copy?
  ans:
  - Fourteen, Harry.

- que:
  - Uh huh. Want me to lose them?
  ans:
  - Helen's going to be pissed.

- que:
  - Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
  ans:
  - Abu Kaleem Malik.

- que:
  - You want me to just hang-- ?
  ans:
  - Just hang a minute.

- que:
  - I'll just hang then, shall I?
  ans:
  - He-- Helen. Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.

- que:
  - You know about that?
  ans:
  - She's lying.

- que:
  - You didn't have sexual relations with him?
  ans:
  - She could be telling the truth.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us.

- que:
  - We're dead, right? So... where'd you put the transmitter?
  ans:
  - In her Walkman. It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.

- que:
  - But you didn't. Why not?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.

- que:
  - You're not going anywhere.
  ans:
  - Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?

- que:
  - Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
  ans:
  - Ten, Mr. Gibson.

- que:
  - Very good. It's sixth century B.C. Do you like the period?
  ans:
  - I adore it.

- que:
  - Well, what's the point of waiting?
  ans:
  - I agree.

- que:
  - So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
  ans:
  - That's right. They want something... dramatic. I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.

- que:
  - Is that why you got into this business?
  ans:
  - I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it.

- que:
  - Yes what?
  ans:
  - Uh, yes, it is important.

- que:
  - Oral hygiene?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - Did you tell her about us, Harry?
  ans:
  - There is no us, you psychotic bitch.

- que:
  - Hi, honey. How was the flight?
  ans:
  - Fine, honey. Stay asleep.

- que:
  - How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
  ans:
  - That's fabulous Harry.

- que:
  - What did you tell him?
  ans:
  - Baby, I said I'd be there. Really. Trust me. Gotta go, honey. Bye bye.

- que:
  - What'd you do, honey?
  ans:
  - Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...

- que:
  - So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did is work out okay?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure. Fine. I'll get some more gravy.

- que:
  - How long have you been a member of his faction?
  ans:
  - I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him.

- que:
  - What did happen?
  ans:
  - Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.

- que:
  - Why did you continue to see him?
  ans:
  - He needed my help.

- que:
  - Not because you were attracted to him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You weren't attracted to him at all?
  ans:
  - Well, maybe a little.

- que:
  - Would you say he was boring, then?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I suppose he is.

- que:
  - Let me handle this part. Do you mind? Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
  ans:
  - He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.

- que:
  - And you agreed?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I guess I needed something...

- que:
  - This Simon. Did you sleep with him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yes or no.
  ans:
  - I love him. I have always loved him and I will always love him. Can I go home, please?

- que:
  - What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved?
  ans:
  - You will be contacted with the assignment.

- que:
  - So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
  ans:
  - What? Oh, the flat tire? Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.

- que:
  - He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
  ans:
  - Let the hooker go. She's not important.

- que:
  - What were you doing there?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't believe me.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this?
  ans:
  - Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.

- que:
  - It makes you tell the truth?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is it working yet?
  ans:
  - Ask me a question I would normally lie to.

- que:
  - 17 years.
  ans:
  - Are we going to die?

- que:
  - My God. Have you had to... have sex with other women in the line of duty?
  ans:
  - I don't take those assignments.

- que:
  - Did you pork her Harry?
  ans:
  - No. But I wanted to.

- que:
  - Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
  ans:
  - Looks that way.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - God, you have great legs.

- que:
  - Do you still love me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - As much as you used to?
  ans:
  - No. Much more.

- que:
  - If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
  ans:
  - We must be in the Florida Keys . connects the islands to the mainland.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.

- que:
  - Wait here. If you have to use this, use it. Don't choke. Okay?
  ans:
  - ... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce. He looked like such a dope.

- que:
  - What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - So what's your angle?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Trade secret.

- que:
  - Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.

- que:
  - Dickless. If they took care of * business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Those idiots.

- que:
  - You working on someone right now?
  ans:
  - I always have a couple on the hook. You know. There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog. It's great.

- que:
  - What does she do?
  ans:
  - Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk.

- que:
  - But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
  ans:
  - Red hot. Her thighs steam.

- que:
  - No. Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
  ans:
  - Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?

- que:
  - I said SIT DOWN. Who do you work for?
  ans:
  - Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.

- que:
  - Of course. Mrs. Tasker. And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal? Taking dictation?
  ans:
  - He said he was an American agent.

- que:
  - Uh... well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Boris and Doris?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - So now it's Tasker? Not Renquist?
  ans:
  - Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.

- que:
  - Like one?
  ans:
  - Fuck you.

- que:
  - Helen? It's Simon. Is it safe to talk?
  ans:
  - Yes. Go ahead.

- que:
  - Yes. I suppose so. Where?
  ans:
  - The same place. One o'clock. I have to go now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I need you.

- que:
  - Are you sure you weren't followed?

  ans:
  - Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the times. But I really can't take credit ...

- que:
  - What is it you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Not here. I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again. We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together. For your safety.

- que:
  - You'll call me then?
  ans:
  - Yes. Now go.

- que:
  - To our assignment.
  ans:
  - What's happened?

- que:
  - What is it you need me to do?
  ans:
  - Helen, I want you to be my wife.

- que:
  - We're going to Paris?

- que:
  - Turn-offs?
  ans:
  - I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.

- que:
  - Do you have a fella?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.

- que:

  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - A real live pimp?

- que:
  - You will?
  ans:
  - You better not be fucking teasing me.

  ans:
  - Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.

- que:
  - Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
  ans:
  - Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.

  - Where you goin', honey?
  ans:
  - I just gotta get somethin'.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - So I can go over there and pick up your things.

- que:
  - You don't know him -
  ans:
  - You don't know him -

- que:
  - Is this a joke?
  ans:
  - No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I think what you did...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - ... was so romantic.

- que:
  - Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.

- que:
  - You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
  ans:
  - Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - With a vengeance, I hated them.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.

- que:
  - It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. \"Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon\". Don't 'cha think?
  ans:
  - But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.

- que:

  ans:
  - Every word of it.

- que:
  - For the very first time in my life. Do you know what that's like?
  ans:
  - This shit can't be real.

- que:
  - Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
  ans:
  - Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.

- que:
  - What'd'ya tell 'em?
  ans:
  - Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.

- que:
  - What's this acting class guy's name?
  ans:
  - Elliot.

- que:
  - Elliot what?
  ans:

  - He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.

- que:
  - You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
  ans:
  - Yeah, OK.

- que:
  - Look, Dick, I don't -
  ans:
  - Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

- que:
  - He trusts you?
  ans:
  - Sure. I didn't hear anything.

- que:
  - Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
  ans:
  - No. No, you don't.

- que:
  - Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
  ans:
  - He wants to talk ya.

  - I can see what you mean.

- que:
  - Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to \"Doctor Zhivago\" are in arbitration?
  ans:
  - I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.

- que:
  - You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
  ans:
  - I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.

- que:
  - Where'd you go?
  ans:
  - A Norms in Van Nuys.

- que:
  - Why does he trust you?
  ans:
  - We grew up together.

- que:
  - If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
  ans:
  - I bullshitted him.

- que:
  - Wanna count your money?
  ans:
  - Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.

- que:
  - Anything stronger? Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
  ans:
  - I can, but I don't.

- que:
  - Go to the liquor store - Where is there a liquor store around here?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.

- que:
  - I'm really not very -
  ans:
  - I really don't know.

- que:
  - Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
  ans:
  - Yes, I still have friends on the force.

- que:
  - What makes you think I could do that?
  ans:
  - You were a cop.

- que:
  - What makes you think I would do that?
  ans:
  - I'm your son.

- que:
  - You got it all worked out, don't you?
  ans:
  - They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.

- que:
  - Do tell. Why drug related?
  ans:
  - Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.

- que:
  - Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
  ans:
  - Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.

- que:
  - We do make a cute couple, don't we?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around. I love you son.

- que:
  - I give up. Who are you?
  ans:
  - I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

- que:
  - What are you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - I don't believe you.

- que:
  - That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
  ans:
  - On their honeymoon.

- que:
  - I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
  ans:
  - They didn't tell me.

- que:
  - Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Oh, don't bother. I got one. So you're a Sicilian, huh?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Come again?
  ans:
  - It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.

- que:
  - You and Robin moved?
  ans:
  - I'm me... I mean, that's me.

- que:
  - Where'd you come from?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

- que:
  - If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
  ans:
  - Sure. No problem.

- que:
  - Could we try it now?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Where'd he come from?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

- que:
  - That Vietnam movie?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Do you believe him?
  ans:
  - I believe he believes him.

- que:
  - He'll wear a wire?
  ans:
  - We talked him into it.

- que:
  - How the fuck could he know?
  ans:
  - He saw the wire.

- que:
  - How's he supposed to see the wire?
  ans:
  - He knows something's up.

- que:
  - What was I sayin'?
  ans:
  - Rock whores.

- que:
  - You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
  ans:
  - Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.

- que:
  - What can I do?
  ans:
  - You gotta hold this for me.

- que:
  - Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
  ans:
  - Naw, he ain't home right now.

- que:
  - Do you live here?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I live here.

- que:
  - Sorta room-mates?
  ans:
  - Exactly room-mates.

- que:
  - How do you know? You been there?
  ans:
  - No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.

- que:
  - Are you Dick Ritchie?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you know a Clarence Worley?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you know where we can find him?
  ans:
  - He's at the Beverly Wilshire.

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - Well, you go down Beechwood...

- que:
  - Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. Do you know Nick Cardella?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I didn't mean -
  ans:
  - Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?

- que:
  - What was the Jew-boy's name?
  ans:
  - Donowitz, he said.

- que:
  - Him? You saw that man?
  ans:
  - Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.

- que:
  - You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
  ans:
  - We want tough minded people. Strong mentally. We've had some...misfortunes with \"unstable\" types.

- que:
  - Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
  ans:
  - But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.

- que:
  - What are you going to do with us?
  ans:
  - It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.

- que:
  - Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
  ans:
  - What's she doing?

- que:
  - And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
  ans:
  - San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

- que:
  - And your only goal is...?
  ans:
  - To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.

- que:
  - So that...?
  ans:
  - Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.

- que:
  - Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
  ans:
  - No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information.

- que:
  - What kind of information?
  ans:
  - It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything.

- que:
  - Change what?
  ans:
  - I need to go.

- que:
  - I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
  ans:
  - They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them.

- que:
  - You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
  ans:
  - I have to go.

- que:
  - A jail? Prison?
  ans:
  - Underground.

- que:
  - Hiding?
  ans:
  - I love this air. This is wonderful air.

- que:
  - What's wonderful about the air, James?
  ans:
  - It's so clean. No germs.

- que:
  - You're afraid of germs?
  ans:
  - I have to go.

- que:
  - This is April, right?
  ans:
  - No, 1995 is the past.

- que:
  - I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
  ans:
  - My father told me that. \"Never cry wolf.\" Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.

- que:
  - \"If something really happens\"...like what, James?
  ans:
  - Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...

- que:
  - Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?
  ans:
  - You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.

- que:
  - We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?
  ans:
  - About an airport...before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have -- the only one. I'm a little kid in it.

- que:
  - And I was in it? What did I do?
  ans:
  - You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.

- que:
  - You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - My notes. Observations. Clues.

- que:
  - They're keeping an eye on me.
  ans:
  - What do you mean -- when you were a kid?

- que:
  - Who's keeping an eye on you?
  ans:
  - The man...with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He...

- que:
  - Are you hurt?
  ans:
  - Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes...

- que:
  - You didn't have a gun before, did you?
  ans:
  - You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.

- que:
  - What's the matter with your leg?
  ans:
  - I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.

- que:
  - Shot! Who shot you?
  ans:
  - It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.

- que:
  - You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
  ans:
  - No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.

- que:
  - What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
  ans:
  - I'm...\"mentally divergent\". I would love to believe that.

- que:
  - First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
  ans:
  - It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground.

- que:
  - Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
  ans:
  - I thought I was in...prison again.

- que:
  - Just like that? You were in prison?
  ans:
  - No, not really. It's...it's in my mind. Like you said.

- que:
  - You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- I don't remember.

- que:
  - The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?
  ans:
  - ...I had a dream about...something like that.

- que:
  - You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?
  ans:
  - You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...

- que:
  - You want me to rob him?
  ans:
  - I...I...We need cash, James.

- que:
  - You... you left them a message?
  ans:
  - You... you couldn't have heard me.

- que:
  - Why are we doing this?
  ans:
  - But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.

- que:
  - Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
  ans:
  - No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.

- que:
  - Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
  ans:
  - Scientists. I'm supposed to report in to them. They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.

- que:
  - So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
  ans:
  - I'm not crazy.

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - They hurt you!

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You know -- your plan.

- que:
  - What're you writing? You a reporter?
  ans:
  - It's private.

- que:
  - What....?
  ans:
  - Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up -- try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part.

- que:
  - I'm here about some monkeys.
  ans:
  - What...?

- que:
  - Excuse me -- what did you say?
  ans:
  - Monkeys. Twelve of them.

- que:
  - I don't have time to go upstairs. The police are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
  ans:
  - I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future!

- que:
  - Jo...Jose?
  ans:
  - The phone call, man. The phone call.

- que:
  - This part isn't about the virus, is it?
  ans:
  - Hey, man...

- que:
  - I mashed the spider, didn't I?
  ans:
  - We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole. Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.

- que:
  - I asked you, why did you volunteer?
  ans:
  - Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered.

- que:
  - It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make that call?
  ans:
  - I couldn't call! You sent me to the wrong year! It was 1989.

- que:
  - But you know what's real now?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - He should have been in restraints. It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to it?
  ans:
  - Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...

- que:
  - He was fully sedated!
  ans:
  - For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!

- que:
  - What...virus?
  ans:
  - She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.

- que:
  - What virus are we talking about, Dad?
  ans:
  - You're insane, Jeffrey.

- que:
  - You really want to know?
  ans:
  - No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.

- que:
  - Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
  ans:
  - You have him in restraints.

- que:
  - You want to go in? Examine him?
  ans:
  - Yes, please. You said he gave a name...

- que:
  - What? What did you say?
  ans:
  - Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.

- que:
  - What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.

- que:
  - Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
  ans:
  - I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?

- que:
  - Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
  ans:
  - All right, old man. Christ.

- que:
  - Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
  ans:
  - I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?

- que:
  - That a fact?
  ans:
  - I can see just fine. For example, You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.

- que:
  - What do you want for free?
  ans:
  - You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.

- que:
  - Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
  ans:
  - I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.

- que:
  - We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
  ans:
  - I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.

- que:
  - Well, a man with some gumption. How much money you got?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You want to make a kiddies bet?
  ans:
  - I'll bet my watch against your pay.

- que:
  - Never heard of it. It's got no day or date. Hell, it ain't even got numbers. What's the matter? You couldn't afford a Timex?
  ans:
  - Next city you're in take it to a jeweler. He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.

- que:
  - Thirty-bucks? That's it?
  ans:
  - That's my morning's pay.

- que:
  - I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
  ans:
  - One-hundred-thirteen degrees. That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.

  - You got two years on me. What's that make me?
  ans:
  - It's nonsense.

- que:
  - And what are you? A rocket scientist?
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.

- que:
  - You own this place?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Then why do you call it Harlin's?
  ans:
  - Cause Harlin used to own it.

- que:

  ans:
  - So?

  - Yeah, I can fix it. Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.

  - That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
  ans:
  - That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.

- que:
  - What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through. Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.

- que:
  - You've been there?
  ans:
  - Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.

  - What's it to you?
  ans:
  - I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.

- que:
  - What would a truck stop be without beer?
  ans:
  - Let me have a Beck's.

- que:
  - Kirin?
  ans:
  - No, we ain't got no Kirin. We got Miller.

- que:
  - No. We got Miller. Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, give me the Miller.

- que:
  - What was that all about?
  ans:
  - You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

- que:
  - Poor thing. Is she all right?
  ans:
  - Lord! Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.

- que:
  - It'd serve you right. Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
  ans:
  - Ned! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?

- que:
  - That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes it is.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Same thing you want. I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please. But that takes money.

- que:
  - ...at the very least. I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars. Now, how much did you get?
  ans:
  - Don't tell him anything. He can't do this.

- que:
  - Can't I? You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk. What do you think, boy?
  ans:
  - There you go, Mrs. McKenna. Just put it in there.

- que:
  - Who was that on the phone?
  ans:
  - Wrong number.

- que:
  - You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
  ans:
  - I put up new drapes, Jake.

- que:
  - I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
  ans:
  - Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.

- que:
  - You didn't hear something?
  ans:
  - How could I? I was sleeping.

- que:
  - When did you buy a gun?
  ans:
  - I'm just going to my car.

- que:
  - Do you have to call me that?
  ans:
  - I don't know your real name.

- que:
  - It's Grace.
  ans:
  - You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?

- que:
  - May I carry your package, Grace?
  ans:
  - Jesus.

- que:
  - You sure you can manage?
  ans:
  - I got it.

- que:
  - Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
  ans:
  - No, I've got it.

- que:
  - What happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - Accident.

- que:
  - I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
  ans:
  - Yes, I have.

- que:
  - Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
  ans:
  - You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.

- que:
  - Drove into Sierra? What for?
  ans:
  - Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.

- que:
  - Where you coming from?
  ans:
  - All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.

- que:
  - Where you headed?
  ans:
  - You just travel around, no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.

- que:
  - What happens if you lose?
  ans:
  - I pack up and go somewhere else.

- que:
  - Did you like it; me watching you?
  ans:
  - I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.

- que:
  - What do you do anyway?
  ans:
  - A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.

- que:
  - Where'd you learn to do that?
  ans:
  - From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman.

- que:
  - A medicine man?
  ans:
  - Those are white words, not ours.

- que:
  - It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
  ans:
  - The same thing you do.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Lift me down.

- que:
  - Beautiful?
  ans:
  - Like they're made of polyester.

- que:
  - No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
  ans:
  - I have ideas.

- que:
  - Such as?
  ans:
  - All right, Grace. No more games.

- que:
  - Games?
  ans:
  - You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.

- que:
  - Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
  ans:
  - I think I can find my own way back to into town.

- que:
  - That's not an answer. What is it you want?
  ans:
  - You know what I want.

- que:
  - You love him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you ever?
  ans:
  - I'm guessing no.

- que:
  - I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
  ans:
  - You could just leave him.

- que:
  - How far is it to California?
  ans:
  - From here? I don't know. Far. Far enough.

- que:
  - Have you ever been there before?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is it pretty?
  ans:
  - Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Jake.

- que:
  - You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
  ans:
  - He doesn't give it to us. We take it.

- que:
  - From?
  ans:
  - You live pretty good.

- que:
  - How much money has he got?
  ans:
  - Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.

- que:
  - We'd have to kill him.
  ans:
  - Lied? What do you mean?

- que:
  - John? John where are you going?
  ans:
  - John, please--

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Kill someone. I can't do it.

- que:
  - I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now. Is there something you wanted?
  ans:
  - I wanted to talk.

- que:
  - There is no us, remember?
  ans:
  - Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.

- que:
  - Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
  ans:
  - Because I know you're full of shit.

- que:
  - Is that what changed your mind? The money?
  ans:
  - I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.

- que:
  - Are you sure? About me, I mean?
  ans:
  - I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.

- que:
  - Grace ... Grace?
  ans:
  - After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.

- que:
  - What was I supposed to do?
  ans:
  - You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.

- que:
  - Where's the safe?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You don't know? Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.

- que:
  - There's easily a hundred-thousand in there. More than that.
  ans:
  - If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?

- que:
  - I told you. I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
  ans:
  - If you want.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.

- que:
  - You got a suitcase?
  ans:
  - Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To get my car.

- que:
  - Wait. What about ... him?
  ans:
  - Put some clothes on him. When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert. It'll takes days for anybody to find him.

- que:
  - John!? What the hell's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell ... that's all.

- que:
  - John ...?
  ans:
  - Sheriff Potter, please. I can't go to jail. I wanted no part of it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You heard me. Count it out.

- que:
  - You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
  ans:
  - Just drive.

- que:
  - I know. He was to take the fucking money.
  ans:
  - Jesus, Grace. Did you have to kill him?

- que:
  - Is that the kind of girl you think I am? What can I do to make you relax?
  ans:
  - You could give me the gun.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.

- que:
  - I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you. Don't you think I care about you?
  ans:
  - I think I busted my leg.

- que:
  - I can't make it. Grace? Grace!?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - Where the hell am I going to go?
  ans:
  - John, you have to throw the keys up to me.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - The trunk. It's locked.

- que:
  - You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
  ans:
  - I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.

- que:
  - And you're not one to lie, are you?
  ans:
  - Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.

- que:
  - Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
  ans:
  - John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.

- que:
  - Who the hell are you?
  ans:
  - I'm her husband.

- que:
  - Husband ...?
  ans:
  - Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.

- que:
  - What happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - Accident.

- que:
  - What brings you to Sierra?
  ans:
  - My car overheated. I pulled in to have it fixed.

- que:
  - Where you headed?
  ans:
  - I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.

- que:
  - Live there?
  ans:
  - Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.

- que:
  - Why would I kill her?
  ans:
  - I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.

- que:
  - Good Lord. What happened to you?
  ans:
  - Just ran into a little trouble.

- que:
  - Another accident? You've really got to be more careful. Can I get you a drink?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Hungry?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
  ans:
  - Nice office you've got.

- que:
  - Now what can I do for you?
  ans:
  - I was hoping we could talk.

- que:
  - Talk? About what?
  ans:
  - About things. About your wife.

- que:
  - Sweet Grace? What about her?
  ans:
  - About what you said this morning.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.

- que:
  - And what does that make you?
  ans:
  - The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.

- que:
  - And for that you'd kill Grace?
  ans:
  - For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.

- que:
  - I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course. Which is?
  ans:
  - Make it twenty.

- que:
  - How much could you get?
  ans:
  - Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.

- que:
  - If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...?
  ans:
  - I guess I might as well get this done with.

- que:
  - What should I do?
  ans:
  - How the hell should I know? I've never had a wife killed before. I guess I should have hired a professional.

- que:
  - And tell her what?
  ans:
  - I went to your place. We talked, just like you told me. We drove out into the desert ...

- que:
  - Is the job done?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You didn't kill her?
  ans:
  - The time wasn't right.

- que:
  - You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
  ans:
  - I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.

- que:
  - You love her, but you hate her?
  ans:
  - All I have in the world.

- que:
  - Trouble with the car again?
  ans:
  - You could say. I don't even have it yet.

- que:
  - Darrell giving you problems?
  ans:
  - He did more work on the car. He wants fifty bucks extra for it.

- que:
  - You came to take my wife from me?
  ans:
  - I came to kill her.

- que:
  - Wh ... what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You're not talking sense.

- que:
  - What are you babbling about?
  ans:
  - You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.

- que:
  - You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
  ans:
  - Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.

- que:
  - What happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.

- que:
  - Got any requests?
  ans:
  - That country shit all sounds the same to me.

- que:
  - How about I pick one out for you?
  ans:
  - You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.

- que:
  - Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
  ans:
  - I've had time to get over it.

- que:
  - You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
  ans:
  - Oz.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For defending my honor this afternoon.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Eighteen. Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.

- que:
  - What's your name anyway?
  ans:
  - Will you shut up!

- que:
  - Make time? Is everybody in this town slap happy?
  ans:
  - Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

- que:
  - You expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.

- que:
  - What? You want to fight? Over her?
  ans:
  - You're fucked.

- que:
  - They're not very imaginative?
  ans:
  - Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off somebody gets hurt.

- que:
  - I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm beating you up.

- que:
  - With a shotgun. It kills him, and it shreads the money. I mean, what are the odds?
  ans:
  - You're the gambler. You tell me.

- que:
  - Do you understand me you little fuck?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. Vesci.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Jesus!

- que:
  - Like I said; you really can't blame the boy. Some people don't know how to avoid trouble. Know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Saw you at the truck stop this morning. You're not from around here.

- que:
  - Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
  ans:
  - Nope. No problems up the road.

- que:
  - Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
  ans:
  - Why don't you step out of the car, son?

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I think you might just want to do as I say.

- que:
  - Soda. You got any soda?
  ans:
  - Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.

- que:
  - What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.

- que:
  - Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
  ans:
  - I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?

- que:
  - Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
  ans:
  - All right, old man. Christ.

- que:
  - Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
  ans:
  - I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?

- que:
  - That a fact?
  ans:
  - Maybe I do.

- que:
  - What do you want for free?
  ans:
  - You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - ...And everything is nothing too.

- que:
  - I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
  ans:
  - Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.

- que:
  - ...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
  ans:
  - I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.

- que:
  - So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
  ans:
  - You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.

- que:
  - Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs?
  ans:
  - Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

- que:
  - You expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.

- que:
  - Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
  ans:
  - Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.

- que:
  - Oh, shit!
  ans:
  - Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?

- que:
  - I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.

- que:
  - Who the hell are you?
  ans:
  - I'm her husband.

- que:
  - What the fuck do you want?
  ans:
  - I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.

- que:
  - Say, what happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - Accident.

- que:
  - \"Bobby Cooper.\" What brings you to Superior, Coop?
  ans:
  - An overheated car.

- que:
  - Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
  ans:
  - Darrell's a moron.

- que:
  - Live there?
  ans:
  - Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.

- que:
  - Would you kill her?
  ans:
  - I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.

- que:
  - What can I do for you, lad?
  ans:
  - I was hoping we could talk.

- que:
  - Talk? About what?
  ans:
  - About things. About your wife.

- que:
  - Sweet Grace? What about her?
  ans:
  - About what you said this morning.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.

- que:
  - And what does that make you?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.

- que:
  - How much could you get?
  ans:
  - Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.

- que:
  - How do you want it?
  ans:
  - You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.

- que:
  - And tell her what?
  ans:
  - I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.

- que:
  - I guess this is what they call \"ironee\"? Hunh?
  ans:
  - It's not what you think, Jake.

- que:
  - You came to take my wife from me?
  ans:
  - Shhh! Liar.

- que:
  - You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
  ans:
  - How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?

- que:
  - What happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.

- que:
  - Got any requests?
  ans:
  - That country shit all sounds the same to me.

- que:
  - How about I pick one out for you?
  ans:
  - You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.

  ans:
  - For defending my honor this afternoon.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.

- que:
  - No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
  ans:
  - You're too late, Toby. We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.

- que:
  - What's your name anyway?
  ans:
  - Nope. Darrell.

- que:
  - Harlin around?
  ans:
  - He's up at the Look Out.

- que:
  - Will he be back soon?
  ans:
  - Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.

- que:
  - You own this place?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Then why do you call it Harlin's?
  ans:
  - Cause Harlin used to own it.

- que:
  - OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
  ans:
  - So?

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - It's your radiator hose. It's busted.

- que:
  - Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I can fix it.

- que:
  - How much time?
  ans:
  - Time.

- que:
  - I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
  ans:
  - Hey.

- que:
  - Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What the hell happened to my car?
  ans:
  - Bottom hose was shot too. Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.

- que:
  - How much!?
  ans:
  - Hundred-fifty.

- que:
  - A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
  ans:
  - About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.

- que:
  - What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but \"it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.\" Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.

- que:
  - You've been there?
  ans:
  - Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.

- que:
  - You believe that?
  ans:
  - You think bad, and bad is what you get.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.

- que:
  - What sign?
  ans:
  - What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.

- que:
  - What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
  ans:
  - Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.

- que:
  - And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
  ans:
  - When I work on a car, I work on a car.

- que:
  - We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up.
  ans:
  - What you want?

- que:
  - What the hell ... oh, it's you. Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over. What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want my car.

- que:
  - You got the money?
  ans:
  - Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.

- que:
  - All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:

  ans:
  - Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.

- que:
  - I'm just going to my car?
  ans:
  - That's right on my way.

- que:
  - Do you have to call me that?
  ans:
  - I don't know your real name.

- que:
  - You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I like that about me, beautiful.

- que:
  - May I carry your package, Grace?
  ans:
  - Jesus.

- que:
  - You sure you can manage?
  ans:
  - I got it.

- que:
  - Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
  ans:
  - No, I've got it.

- que:
  - What happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - Accident.

- que:
  - Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
  ans:
  - You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.

- que:
  - Drove into Superior? What for?
  ans:
  - Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.

- que:
  - You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
  ans:
  - Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.

- que:
  - Where you coming from?
  ans:
  - All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.

- que:
  - So, what is it you do, Mister...?
  ans:
  - Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .

- que:
  - What happens when you lose?
  ans:
  - I pack up and go somewhere else.

- que:
  - Did you like it; me watching you?
  ans:
  - I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.

- que:
  - What do you do anyway?
  ans:
  - A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.

- que:
  - Where'd you learn to do that?
  ans:
  - From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.

- que:
  - A medicine man?
  ans:
  - Those are white words, not ours.

- que:
  - It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
  ans:
  - The same thing you do.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Lift me down.

- que:
  - You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
  ans:
  - Like you.

- que:
  - Beautiful?
  ans:
  - I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.

- que:
  - No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
  ans:
  - I have an idea.

- que:
  - And what would that be?
  ans:
  - You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.

- que:
  - Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
  ans:
  - I think I can find my own way back to into town.

- que:
  - That's not an answer. What is it you want?
  ans:
  - You know what I want.

- que:
  - How do you know he's still not here?
  ans:
  - Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.

- que:
  - Are there snakes out here?
  ans:
  - They hear you comin'. They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.

- que:
  - You love him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is that why you're with him?
  ans:
  - I'm guessing no.

- que:
  - I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
  ans:
  - You could leave him.

- que:
  - What's the matter?...Grace?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You mean the Shaman?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is it pretty?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.

- que:
  - You don't have any money put away, do you?
  ans:
  - Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.

- que:
  - In cash?
  ans:
  - One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of-a-bitch.

- que:
  - If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
  ans:
  - Kill him.

- que:
  - There is no us, remember?
  ans:
  - Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.

- que:
  - Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
  ans:
  - Because I know you're full of shit.

- que:
  - Is that what changed your mind? The money?
  ans:
  - I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.

- que:
  - Are you sure?... About me, I mean?
  ans:
  - You said you couldn't kill anybody.

- que:
  - Grace ... Grace?
  ans:
  - I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.

- que:
  - Good thinking. What's all this?
  ans:
  - You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.

- que:
  - I don't know about that?
  ans:
  - You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.

- que:
  - Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
  ans:
  - I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.

- que:
  - Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
  ans:
  - I'm not sailing his boat.

- que:
  - What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
  ans:
  - You already have.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me.

- que:
  - Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
  ans:
  - Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...

- que:
  - Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
  ans:
  - You could give me my gun back.

- que:
  - You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
  ans:
  - I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.

- que:
  - I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
  ans:
  - I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...

- que:
  - Can you make it back up?
  ans:
  - Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - Cause I love you.

- que:
  - Where ya goin'?
  ans:
  - Harlin's.

- que:
  - Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today. You're not planning on staying are you?
  ans:
  - No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.

- que:
  - The old lady?
  ans:
  - Which you don't have.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - Out of here.

- que:
  - But, in particular?
  ans:
  - I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.

- que:
  - One way, or round trip?
  ans:
  - One way.

- que:
  - What kind?
  ans:
  - Beck's.

- que:
  - Heineken?
  ans:
  - No, we ain't got no Heineken. We got Miller.

- que:
  - Genuine Draft?
  ans:
  - No. Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.

- que:
  - What was that all about?
  ans:
  - You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

- que:
  - You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
  ans:
  - No baby, you got it wrong.

- que:
  - This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
  ans:
  - Wrong number.

- que:
  - You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
  ans:
  - I put up new drapes, Jake.

- que:
  - I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
  ans:
  - You never said anything. About the drapes.

- que:
  - What the hell you looking at, girl?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.

- que:
  - Like you helped her, Jake?
  ans:
  - I axed you a question.

- que:
  - You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
  ans:
  - Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.

- que:
  - I am Russian, da! I am also rich Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
  ans:
  - What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...

- que:
  - What's that? ...\"concealed\" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
  ans:
  - No sir he is not. I read about you in the paper.

- que:
  - Is that the entire message?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Once again please?
  ans:
  - My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.

- que:
  - How old is Jeb?
  ans:
  - Four.

- que:
  - What did I say?
  ans:
  - I'm listening.

- que:
  - What about Jeb?
  ans:
  - I have a lock on the door.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.

- que:
  - Is Jeremy okay?
  ans:
  - He's asleep.

- que:
  - Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
  ans:
  - ...I can't remember.

- que:
  - That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
  ans:
  - It means we're probably to tired to remember.

- que:
  - Is that what you wanted to ask me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - When was the last time I wore pink?
  ans:
  - The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.

- que:
  - Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
  ans:
  - My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.

- que:
  - What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
  ans:
  - You use your sleeve.

- que:
  - out again?
  ans:
  - Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.

- que:
  - Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - ...I think rust.

- que:
  - As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
  ans:
  - I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.

- que:
  - My turn. What's your favorite song?
  ans:
  - Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - We're supposed to be honest.

- que:
  - My turn. When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - What about the game?
  ans:
  - That counts.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know Megan.

- que:
  - You've never been sick?
  ans:
  - I don't know for sure. ...I don't think so.

- que:
  - How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
  ans:
  - Seventy-five percent.

- que:
  - What's he talking about?
  ans:
  - In college. A car accident.

- que:
  - Was it serious?
  ans:
  - I assumed because of the train.

- que:
  - At the church... You were following me weren't you?
  ans:
  - Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.

- que:
  - What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
  ans:
  - You've misunderstood.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.

- que:
  - Are you for real?
  ans:
  - Just give me a minute.

- que:
  - Is there a problem?
  ans:
  - I got you a seat in the seven hundred level. It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.

- que:
  - How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
  ans:
  - Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.

- que:
  - You thought he was carrying a knife?
  ans:
  - I thought he was carrying something.

- que:
  - But not a knife?
  ans:
  - I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. Like on t.v.

- que:
  - Telling when people have done something wrong?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I don't know what you're asking?
  ans:
  - You're skill.

- que:
  - The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
  ans:
  - I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.

- que:
  - Are you finished?
  ans:
  - I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

- que:
  - What's he look like?
  ans:
  - He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Just now. They want you to come down to his school.

- que:
  - Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
  ans:
  - I want to sleep here tonight.

- que:
  - Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
  ans:
  - How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?

- que:
  - Jeremy. I'm going in. I have to do some things.
  ans:
  - Why'd you do that?

- que:
  - What things?
  ans:
  - I'm going to work out.

- que:
  - You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
  ans:
  - You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.

- que:
  - How much can you lift?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I mean if you knew karate?
  ans:
  - No Jeremy.

- que:
  - How much did you take off?
  ans:
  - I lied.

- que:
  - How much is it?
  ans:
  - Two hundred and seventy.

- que:
  - What do you do if something happens?
  ans:
  - Get mom.

- que:
  - How many did you put on that time?
  ans:
  - All of it.

- que:
  - There's no more left?
  ans:
  - I'm sleeping in my room.

- que:
  - Do you know why?
  ans:
  - I know now.

- que:
  - Know what?
  ans:
  - You're secret identity. That man was right.

- que:
  - You like sports?
  ans:
  - It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.

- que:
  - I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Is David Dunne there?
  ans:
  - He doesn't look very threatening.

- que:
  - SCRUBS How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - SCRUBS You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident. How's your vision?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - SCRUBS Where were you sitting on the train?
  ans:
  - Against a window.

- que:
  - SCRUBS Was your family traveling with you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - SCRUBS Did you get up from your seat?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How long have you been married?
  ans:
  - Twelve years.

- que:
  - How did you get together?
  ans:
  - Now you're going to have to tell me more.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - You and my mother would have a special connection.

- que:
  - Is this a religious thing?
  ans:
  - I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.

- que:
  - Forget why. Do you want it or not?
  ans:
  - Well, go get it then.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - On a bench, across the street.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.

- que:
  - A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
  ans:
  - Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.

- que:
  - You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
  ans:
  - I fined 'em instead.

- que:
  - If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
  ans:
  - On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.

- que:
  - Where'd you get the money, huh?
  ans:
  - We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.

- que:
  - What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
  ans:
  - That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...

- que:
  - Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
  ans:
  - Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.

- que:
  - Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
  ans:
  - Course he's coming.

- que:
  - He didn't say nothin', huh?
  ans:
  - Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.

- que:
  - ...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
  ans:
  - I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...

- que:
  - He tell you where them others is?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - He give 'em names?
  ans:
  - Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.

- que:
  - Some big guy beat the shit out of me. I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
  ans:
  - You don't look nothin' like me, mister.

- que:
  - I didn't mean no offense. I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up. Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
  ans:
  - They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.

- que:
  - Scouting?
  ans:
  - On the Bar T... looking for... them.

- que:
  - Three days. Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - Three days? I must be.

- que:
  - Yeah, I guess. There's still a payment, ain't there?
  ans:
  - Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.

  ans:

  ans:

  - He ain't shootin' our way no more. He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
  ans:
  - Beats the hell out of me.

- que:
  - You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Five. I killed five of 'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife.

  - Jesus. You done this before?
  ans:
  - Plenty of times.

  ans:
  - He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

- que:
  - Depends what he told you. About Bill, you mean?
  ans:
  - All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.

- que:
  - He's gonna die, ain't he?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Well, suppose he does?
  ans:
  - We'll bury him.

- que:
  - You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
  ans:
  - I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.

- que:
  - Just like that?
  ans:
  - I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before. I'm more killer than him.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Hell, yeah.

- que:
  - I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What was the money for?
  ans:
  - Bear with me here...

- que:
  - Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
  ans:
  - They want more time to think about investing.

- que:
  - Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
  ans:
  - Come home, Dean.

- que:
  - I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
  ans:
  - A glass of water would be nice.

- que:
  - So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
  ans:
  - Umm ...

- que:
  - A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
  ans:
  - I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.

- que:
  - So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
  ans:
  - I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.

- que:
  - I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.

- que:
  - We all go. How about it, Keaton?
  ans:
  - DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.

- que:
  - The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all about?
  ans:
  - He's alright.

- que:
  - How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
  ans:
  - Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.

- que:
  - Can we stealth these guys?
  ans:
  - I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

- que:
  - What are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - I can run. I got no problem with that.

- que:
  - Did you hear what he just said?
  ans:
  - If I'm going in, I want a stake.

- que:
  - You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
  ans:
  - I walked. Ninety days, suspended.

- que:
  - They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
  ans:
  - How do you do?

- que:
  - What fence? Who?
  ans:
  - Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.

- que:
  - What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
  ans:
  - They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.

- que:
  - Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
  ans:
  - You watch your mouth.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I'11 be alright.

- que:
  - How are they going to do it?
  ans:
  - McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.

- que:
  - Three million?
  ans:
  - Maybe more.

- que:
  - No killing?
  ans:
  - Not if we do it my way.

- que:
  - What-are they speaking?
  ans:
  - Russian, I think. I don't know.

- que:
  - Just do what I tell you.
  ans:
  - Hungarian?

- que:
  - How are you, Keaton?
  ans:
  - I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.

- que:
  - This I had to see myself.
  ans:
  - Ready?

- que:
  - with what?
  ans:
  - You know damn well, dead-man.

- que:
  - Who's your boss?
  ans:
  - My employer wishes to remain anonymous.

- que:
  - What about Redfoot?
  ans:
  - The answer is no.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.

- que:
  - Business or personal?
  ans:
  - A little of both.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.

- que:
  - Did they charge him with anything?
  ans:
  - Weapons. Misdemeanor two.

- que:
  - When does he post bail?
  ans:
  - Two hours, tops.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Something I - forget it.

- que:
  - If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
  ans:
  - And I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions.

- que:
  - You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
  ans:
  - I just want to hear your story.

- que:
  - You know Ruby is in Attica?
  ans:
  - He didn't have my lawyer.

- que:
  - What lawyer?
  ans:
  - The D.A. gave me immunity.

- que:
  - Is he the one that killed Keaton?
  ans:
  - No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.

- que:
  - Do you believe in him, Verbal?
  ans:
  - Keaton always said, I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him. Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.

- que:
  - You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
  ans:
  - Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.

- que:
  - I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
  ans:
  - If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.

- que:
  - Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
  ans:
  - You're stalling, Verbal.

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.

- que:
  - What call?
  ans:
  - Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

- que:
  - I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
  ans:
  - Why didn't you say anything?

- que:
  - Then why didn't you help him?
  ans:
  - I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.

- que:
  - It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
  ans:
  - I never heard of him.

- que:
  - But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone?
  ans:
  - He wanted me to live.

- que:
  - I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
  ans:
  - Because he was my friend.

- que:
  - You think he's..?
  ans:
  - I'm not bait. No way. I post today.

- que:
  - Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
  ans:
  - Mr. Abraham...

- que:
  - Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
  ans:
  - She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.

- que:
  - What did he find?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - How good's your intelligence?
  ans:
  - Very good.

- que:
  - And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
  ans:
  - As far as we know, nothing.

- que:
  - If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
  ans:
  - Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...

- que:
  - I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did you settle on the amount?
  ans:
  - We thought it was just.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - It looks that way.

- que:
  - You know what that would mean? To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
  ans:
  - ... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.

- que:
  - What does it mean?
  ans:
  - They want to settle. It means a lot of money.

- que:
  - Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
  ans:
  - No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...

- que:
  - You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Anything special about the case?
  ans:
  - When she...

- que:
  - Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
  ans:
  - Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...

- que:
  - What did these people do when her heart stopped?
  ans:
  - We went to Code Blue...

- que:
  - Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
  ans:
  - Well, many reasons, actually...

- que:
  - Tell me one?
  ans:
  - She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...

- que:
  - ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
  ans:
  - My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...

- que:
  - ...to get her heartbeat back...?
  ans:
  - We've touched on this, his own witness has said...

- que:
  - Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
  ans:
  - That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.

- que:
  - Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
  ans:
  - Just as you are, Sir...

- que:
  - Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
  ans:
  - No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...

  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Neurology?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I know of him.

- que:
  - How is that?
  ans:
  - Through, through his book.

  - What book is that?
  ans:
  - Meth...Methodology and Technique...

  - ...of Anesthesiology?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I am seventy-four years old.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
  ans:
  - I'm on the staff of...

- que:
  - Mr. Concannon...?
  ans:
  - Nothing further, your Honor.

- que:
  - Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
  ans:
  - Objection! This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

- que:
  - You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
  ans:
  - It's a crime.

- que:
  - You would not...?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
  ans:
  - I do. Yes.

- que:
  - You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
  ans:
  - Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.

- que:
  - And why, please tell us, would you think that?
  ans:
  - ... that's all right.

- que:
  - You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are...?
  ans:
  - Hold on a second.

- que:
  - I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
  ans:
  - It's all right, Mickey.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...

  - What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
  ans:
  - I am on the staff of...

- que:
  - She getting good care over there?
  ans:
  - Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...

- que:
  - Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
  ans:
  - I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.

- que:
  - Dr. Thompson...?
  ans:
  - It was good of you to meet...

- que:
  - Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
  ans:
  - It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

- que:
  - I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?

  - Why?
  ans:

  - Do you know who her doctors were?
  ans:
  - I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.

  - Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
  ans:
  - Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.

  ans:
  - Laura.

- que:
  - What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
  ans:
  - You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.

- que:
  - The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
  ans:
  - I think I will.

- que:
  - Maybe what?
  ans:
  - Maybe I can do something right.

- que:
  - And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm going to try to do.

  ans:
  - I...

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.

- que:
  - And what makes you so tough?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'll tell you later.

- que:
  - Is there going to be a later...?
  ans:
  - Not if you don't grow up...

- que:
  - What is that to you...?
  ans:
  - What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.

- que:
  - Is it over?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I don't have a goddamned idea.

  - Are you with me...are you awake...?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm awake.

- que:
  - Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
  ans:
  - Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.

- que:
  - All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
  ans:
  - What difference can that make...? All right...

- que:
  - The 'History'...?
  ans:
  - How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...

  - I just saw her.

- que:
  - Hi. How are you doing?
  ans:
  - I've been meaning to come in a long time.

- que:
  - You live in the neighborhood?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.

- que:
  - How old is he?
  ans:
  - Four. You're great with these kids.

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - Mrs...

  - That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
  ans:
  - Kathy Price...

- que:
  - These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
  ans:
  - Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.

- que:
  - D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:
  - She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.

- que:
  - And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - Another, Frank ... ?
  ans:
  - I want to buy you a drink.

- que:
  - Well, well, well. Huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What happened in those three minutes...?
  ans:
  - We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...

- que:
  - Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Huh. And why is that?
  ans:
  - Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...

- que:
  - Should I?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The Big Boy did...?
  ans:
  - Huh.

- que:
  - Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
  ans:
  - It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.

- que:
  - How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
  ans:
  - I married into it.

- que:
  - How long have you been back?
  ans:
  - Almost a year.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you be sitting down?
  ans:
  - No, I'm all right.

- que:
  - Would you like a drink now?
  ans:
  - Not what you think. We're very happily married.

- que:
  - Then?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid some harm may come to her.

- que:
  - From whom?
  ans:
  - Someone dead.

- que:
  - Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
  ans:
  - Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.

- que:
  - No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How often does this happen?
  ans:
  - More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.

- que:
  - We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first. Which is easier?
  ans:
  - Ernie's.

- que:
  - Carlotta Valdes was what, your wife's grandmother?
  ans:
  - Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.

- que:
  - Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
  ans:
  - Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.

- que:
  - Why did she never tell her daughter?
  ans:
  - Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine. Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - She... went into the Bay.

- que:
  - Did she hurt herself?
  ans:
  - No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.

- que:
  - Just let me talk to you.
  ans:
  - Could I ask you a couple of questions?

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - About three years.
  ans:
  - What do you want to know?

- que:
  - Listen, what is this? What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to know who you are.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...

- que:
  - Dinner... and what else?
  ans:
  - Just dinner.

- que:
  - Because I remind you of her?
  ans:
  - Mmm.

- que:
  - Don't go.
  ans:
  - Can I see you tomorrow?

- que:
  - And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
  ans:
  - I'll take care of you.

- que:
  - As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd \"take care of me\"?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Will you, Judy?
  ans:
  - I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.

- que:
  - Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
  ans:
  - No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?

- que:
  - Honest?
  ans:
  - There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.

- que:
  - Scottie, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to buy you a suit.

- que:
  - You want me to dress like her?
  ans:
  - I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.

- que:
  - Where shall we go for dinner?
  ans:
  - Wherever you'd like...

- que:
  - Mmmm.
  ans:
  - Ernie's?

- que:
  - Is that the best you can do?
  ans:
  - Come here.

- que:
  - I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. There.

- que:
  - I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
  ans:
  - No, it's all right.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To complete my cure.

- que:
  - Scottie, why are we here?
  ans:
  - I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.

- que:
  - But why? Why here?
  ans:
  - Madeleine died here.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Dead. He'd broken her neck.

- que:
  - Your accident...
  ans:
  - I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --

- que:
  - I don't know... Switzerland?
  ans:
  - We'll find him.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I loved you, Madeleine.

- que:
  - Why am I here? What happened?
  ans:
  - You... ...fell into the Bay.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset. Ah... thank you for the fire.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - This afternoon.

- que:
  - Before? Where? Where had you been?
  ans:
  - Please drink your coffee.

- que:
  - You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
  ans:
  - Wandering about.

- que:
  - You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
  ans:
  - Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.

- que:
  - I prefer John. There, that's done. And what do you do, John?
  ans:
  - Wander about.

- que:
  - That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
  ans:
  - One shouldn't live alone.

- que:
  - ...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
  ans:
  - No... this is the first time for me, too.

- que:
  - I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - You've nothing to apologize for.

- que:
  - I hope we will, too.
  ans:
  - Would you like some coffee?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Meet again, sometime.

- que:
  - Shopping?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well... anywhere in particular?
  ans:
  - No, I Just thought I'd wander.

- que:
  - Oh, yes, I forgot, It's your occupation, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...

- que:
  - How can you be sure?
  ans:
  - If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.

- que:
  - How old?
  ans:
  - Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.

- que:
  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Knowing I have to die...

- que:
  - Do you hear anything?
  ans:
  - Only silence. It's always like this.

- que:
  - Would you like a drink of water?
  ans:
  - Here with you.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - The tall trees...

- que:
  - Have you been here before?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Where were you born?
  ans:
  - Long ago...

- que:
  - Home?
  ans:
  - ...somewhere in the light.

- que:
  - And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
  ans:
  - Yesterday.

- que:
  - What do you remember?
  ans:
  - A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...

- que:
  - Would you know the room?
  ans:
  - No... it's in shadow.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - A grave...

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I know.

- que:
  - A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
  ans:
  - Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?

- que:
  - I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
  ans:
  - And so explain it away? But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?

- que:
  - Why? What's happened?
  ans:
  - I had the dream. The dream came back again...

- que:
  - Where's your husband?
  ans:
  - I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...

- que:
  - It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?

  - Why?
  ans:
  - Let me go.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Yes.

  - Carlotta Valdes?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign. But sweet.

- que:
  - How long has she had the room?
  ans:
  - Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.

- que:
  - Would you please go and look?
  ans:
  - In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...

- que:
  - Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
  ans:
  - More than you think.

- que:
  - What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
  ans:
  - You sound so disapproving, Midge.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.

- que:
  - And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
  ans:
  - It's where you belong.

- que:
  - Well?... what'll you do?
  ans:
  - Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.

- que:
  - Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
  ans:
  - To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.

- que:
  - Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
  ans:
  - I'm having one now.

- que:
  - How's your love life, Midge?
  ans:
  - That's following a train of thought.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Normal.

- que:
  - Aren't you ever going to get married?
  ans:
  - You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.

- que:
  - Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
  ans:
  - Three whole weeks.

- que:
  - That's Skid Row... isn't it?
  ans:
  - Could be.

- que:
  - Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
  ans:
  - What.

- que:
  - I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

- que:
  - Do you know him well?
  ans:
  - Pop Leibel? Sure.

- que:
  - All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
  ans:
  - The poor thing....

- que:
  - I've told you enough.
  ans:
  - For what?

- que:
  - Who's the guy, who's the wife?
  ans:
  - Just wander.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Around.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Mm. Better.

- que:
  - Did you need it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What was this desperate urge to see me?
  ans:
  - All I said in the note was, \"Where are you?\" That doesn't sound desperate to me.

- que:
  - Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
  ans:
  - Oh... this and that.

- que:
  - What I've been doing?
  ans:
  - If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.

- que:
  - What have you been doing?
  ans:
  - Wandering.

- que:
  - No, not exactly. Want to see?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...

- que:
  - What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
  ans:
  - It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.

- que:
  - By whom?
  ans:
  - She died.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - By her own hand. There are many such stories.

- que:
  - How soon can it be altered?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - Can we have it by tonight?
  ans:
  - We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.

- que:
  - I said how's it going?
  ans:
  - I didn't hear you.

- que:
  - Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
  ans:
  - Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

- que:
  - Oh, and why am I an asshole?
  ans:
  - Multiple reasons.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's sacrilegious.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - You're not a team player.

- que:
  - What are you fucking talking about?
  ans:
  - Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.

- que:
  - You want to hear me out?
  ans:
  - I'm calling the ambulance.

- que:
  - Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Calling the ambulance.

- que:
  - Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
  ans:
  - We have to call the ambulance.

- que:
  - Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
  ans:
  - Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.

- que:
  - We can do this. We can get her out of here.
  ans:
  - Are you sure this was an accident?

- que:
  - You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
  ans:
  - We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.

- que:
  - What about the blood?
  ans:
  - Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.

- que:
  - Have you ever done this before?
  ans:
  - Sun rises at 5,52.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We can't do this.

- que:
  - How do you figure?
  ans:
  - So that's what we're doing.

- que:
  - Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
  ans:
  - I can't do this.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - At the seven-eleven.

- que:
  - I got children. I've got a life.
  ans:
  - Who? What are you talking about?

- que:
  - All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
  ans:
  - No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They're screaming for Starbursts.

- que:
  - That's one idea.
  ans:
  - Where's the candy?

- que:
  - No...we want padded chairs...okay?
  ans:
  - Real times.

- que:
  - Are you solid with that?
  ans:
  - No. I think it's fucked.

- que:
  - Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
  ans:
  - I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...

- que:
  - Where's the bathroom?
  ans:
  - My god.

- que:
  - Money?
  ans:
  - Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Well, oh...

- que:
  - So where's that leave us?
  ans:
  - So. When is the wedding.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Don't sweet lip me.

- que:
  - Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
  ans:
  - Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...

- que:
  - Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
  ans:
  - He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.

- que:
  - I'm with Tina. Is she there?
  ans:
  - She's not here.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.

- que:
  - The groom?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Doing the bachelor party thing?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day. Where's Tina?
  ans:
  - She's in the bathroom...she's still working.

- que:
  - She's still working?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Is everything okay?
  ans:
  - Great. Fine. Perfect.

- que:
  - Fish?
  ans:
  - Your investment ideas never work out.

- que:
  - Where do you look? What side of the neck?
  ans:
  - Left side.

- que:
  - What is her disposition?
  ans:
  - He just had two.

- que:
  - Who's up for making some real money?
  ans:
  - Not really. Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...

- que:
  - What kind of words?
  ans:
  - Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.

- que:
  - No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
  ans:
  - He's cracked up.

- que:
  - Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
  ans:
  - I don't know! I just want to get married.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - What you just said. Say it again.

- que:
  - Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
  ans:
  - No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Take care of business.

- que:
  - And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Hear what?
  ans:
  - That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
  ans:
  - This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.

- que:
  - My what?
  ans:
  - You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.

- que:
  - Okay fine.
  ans:
  - You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?

- que:
  - Fine? Fine what?
  ans:
  - Whatever you say Kojak.

- que:
  - Moore?
  ans:
  - Your ideas never work out.

- que:
  - Oh really? Starbucks?
  ans:
  - I don't hate women.

- que:
  - And what happens when you can't?
  ans:
  - New king.

- que:
  - If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
  ans:
  - Israel doesn't have a King.

- que:
  - Then what do they have?
  ans:
  - They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.

- que:
  - What's your point?
  ans:
  - The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.

- que:
  - What? What's your point?
  ans:
  - Take Mexico.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.

- que:
  - The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
  ans:
  - Ball park sausages.

- que:
  - You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
  ans:
  - Easy Micheal.

- que:
  - Come on tough guy. Listen to me. You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
  ans:
  - I love you.

- que:
  - Are we supposed to?
  ans:
  - It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.

- que:
  - The rings?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - Why can't we do it through the mail?
  ans:
  - We missed the deadline.

- que:
  - Can't we do it on the phone?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Why is this Kid staring at me?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - What do you mean, you think so?
  ans:
  - I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.

- que:
  - The wedding cake check?
  ans:
  - Sent it.

- que:
  - Photographer?
  ans:
  - Sent it.

- que:
  - Florist?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Caterer?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You forgot the tent?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Why did you forget the tent check?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - How could I know what else I forgot?
  ans:
  - I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...

- que:
  - Are we going to do this again?
  ans:
  - I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.

- que:
  - Right before the wedding?
  ans:
  - It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.

- que:
  - Who else?
  ans:
  - Charles Moore for instants.

- que:
  - What does Moore have to do with your growing?
  ans:
  - I just don't see him in the big picture.

- que:
  - Why? What's his problem?
  ans:
  - He's a great chef.

- que:
  - You expect more what?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - With all my heart.

- que:
  - Kiss me...?
  ans:
  - We've got problems here.

- que:
  - Problems?
  ans:
  - Seating problems.

- que:
  - I'm not. What's the problem?
  ans:
  - We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.

- que:
  - What kind of seats can we have?
  ans:
  - Not padded ones.

- que:
  - So what do we do?
  ans:
  - You go down there.

- que:
  - Go down where?
  ans:
  - Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.

- que:
  - Do you love me?
  ans:
  - More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.

- que:
  - Will you please call the chair people?
  ans:
  - I will.

- que:
  - Do you love me?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Hi. Are you calling from jail?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it, I've made three calls. I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just a bit of organizing.

- que:
  - Nesting?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Nesting.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.

- que:
  - How late?
  ans:
  - No. Just like an hour or so.

- que:
  - What about the chairs?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
  ans:
  - What okay?

- que:
  - You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
  ans:
  - No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.

- que:
  - What's the word on the chairs?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it.

- que:
  - Well, can you come back inside?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sure.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.

- que:
  - Are they fighting?
  ans:
  - No baby. We'll all be right in.

- que:
  - Can we just talk this out?
  ans:
  - Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...

- que:
  - Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You.

- que:
  - What kind of stupid question is that?
  ans:
  - Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.

- que:
  - Who's dead?
  ans:
  - The prostitute.

- que:
  - You fucked a prostitute?
  ans:
  - No Micheal did. It was an accident.

- que:
  - My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
  ans:
  - She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.

- que:
  - You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
  ans:
  - He kept saying he was protected.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.

- que:
  - Like how?
  ans:
  - The only proof is those bodies.

- que:
  - So what do we do?
  ans:
  - Move the bodies.

- que:
  - Move the bodies?
  ans:
  - You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Dad. It's great.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - It means she's insecure.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - I just want her to be happy.

- que:
  - You're not breathing right?
  ans:
  - Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I'll take a ride.

- que:
  - Where did you get that?
  ans:
  - At the newsstand on 3rd.

- que:
  - Buzzing?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.

- que:
  - The wahoo moment?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.

- que:
  - Did she believe you?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - A move?
  ans:
  - Greenpeace.

- que:
  - Greenpeace?
  ans:
  - Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...

- que:
  - Where's Boyd?
  ans:
  - Downstairs in the closet.

- que:
  - Did he try to kiss you?
  ans:
  - All week long.

- que:
  - You alright?
  ans:
  - There.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.

- que:
  - I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
  ans:
  - I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.

- que:
  - Okay great. What will that be?
  ans:
  - We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.

- que:
  - You know, Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me. Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
  ans:
  - What song?

- que:
  - Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - So where to on the honeymoon?
  ans:
  - Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.

- que:
  - Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes.

- que:
  - Where's the camera?
  ans:
  - It's a present from my parents.

- que:
  - So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
  ans:
  - Two.

- que:
  - Are there many windows?
  ans:
  - Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Enedina and Paco ...

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - They're playing games behind the couch ...

- que:
  - Which couch?
  ans:
  - That one.

- que:
  - I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
  ans:
  - Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.

- que:
  - How long are you staying?
  ans:
  - A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.

- que:
  - Was that difficult to get?
  ans:
  - No. Mother Superior told me to come.

- que:
  - Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
  ans:
  - You have no feelings toward ...

- que:
  - Who is she?
  ans:
  - My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I didn't say anything.

- que:
  - Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - Don't you ever see him?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - How could anybody behave like that?
  ans:
  - Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...

- que:
  - Wasn't that cowardice?
  ans:
  - Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.

- que:
  - Then you won't forgive me?
  ans:
  - Leave me now. You can go to bed.

- que:
  - Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
  ans:
  - I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.

- que:
  - Sit down, woman, sit down. You like me, don't you?
  ans:
  - I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.

- que:
  - Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
  ans:
  - Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.

- que:
  - But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
  ans:
  - Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.

- que:
  - But what can I say to her, sir?
  ans:
  - Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.

- que:
  - You believe me, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What will the lady say?
  ans:
  - She won't even know.

- que:
  - Is it all right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How much is that?
  ans:
  - Fifteen yards.

- que:
  - That's fifteen by seven?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
  ans:
  - The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.

- que:
  - And in the vegetable plot?
  ans:
  - That's good land.

- que:
  - No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock. Okay, let's get a move on! When are you leaving?
  ans:
  - Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.

- que:
  - Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
  ans:
  - It's very good.

- que:
  - Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
  ans:
  - But why? Why?

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Why the bad temper?
  ans:
  - It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.

- que:
  - What are you thinking about?
  ans:
  - That your cousin is more to your taste.

- que:
  - How in hell does it wind up?
  ans:
  - I think I'd better go tomorrow.

- que:
  - That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
  ans:
  - Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...

- que:
  - He was very good. Better than some people would think.
  ans:
  - Where's the dough?

- que:
  - Why did he kill himself?
  ans:
  - I don't know, sir.

- que:
  - And this chest?
  ans:
  - There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't be here otherwise.

- que:
  - Are you Jorge?
  ans:
  - Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.

- que:
  - Well... is it so urgent?
  ans:
  - I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...

- que:
  - What do you know about me?
  ans:
  - I know that you used to work with an architect.

- que:
  - Do they worry you that much, then?
  ans:
  - They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.

- que:
  - Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.

- que:
  - Are they going to work here too?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.

- que:
  - Yes. Why?
  ans:
  - You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.

- que:
  - And ...your friend?
  ans:
  - She's left.

- que:
  - Is she coming back?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then let him go and he'll follow you.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - And let him get run over by somebody else?
  ans:
  - He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.

- que:
  - How much do you want for him?
  ans:
  - I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.

- que:
  - They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
  ans:
  - What's he called?

- que:
  - Are you sure it isn't contagious?
  ans:
  - Things seem to be getting better.

- que:
  - Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
  ans:
  - You cannot leave ...

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - There's been an accident.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Come with me.

- que:
  - Why are you crying?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid.

- que:
  - He couldn't get through the door, then?
  ans:
  - He came in through the cupboard.

- que:
  - Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
  ans:
  - They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.

- que:
  - What's going on, Moncho?
  ans:
  - I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.

- que:
  - He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
  ans:
  - I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...

- que:
  - Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
  ans:
  - Mother.

- que:
  - Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
  ans:
  - Forgive me if I have offended you.

- que:
  - Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
  ans:
  - When you are, miss.

- que:
  - Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
  ans:
  - I've had a gutful of this.

- que:
  - What about you, Manuel?
  ans:
  - I'm only good at making people laugh.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - I have a headache.

- que:
  - What happened to me?
  ans:
  - You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.

- que:
  - Have I slept long?
  ans:
  - Oh, you slept well; don't worry.

- que:
  - Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
  ans:
  - Today, a good girl.

- que:
  - How did you see me?
  ans:
  - From the terrace.

- que:
  - I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
  ans:
  - No, I don't want to.

- que:
  - Can you tell us what's on the disc?
  ans:
  - In English, please.

- que:
  - Me? What did I do?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

- que:
  - Why wasn't I told?
  ans:
  - We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.

- que:
  - Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
  ans:
  - Catch him and your record's clean.

- que:
  - Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
  ans:
  - There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.

- que:
  - What are they doing in Los Feliz?
  ans:
  - Madison lives two blocks from their present location.

- que:
  - Why would they be going there?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
  ans:
  - Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.

- que:
  - What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
  ans:
  - He was a computer program for crissake.

- que:
  - Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
  ans:
  - I'm getting by.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - Do me a favor  keep sending them.

- que:
  - These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
  ans:
  - I've seen worse.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. Can you kill it?
  ans:
  - If you can catch him.

- que:
  - Fine  you want to stay here?
  ans:
  - Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted. So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.

- que:
  - Their weapons missing?
  ans:
  - Sid 6.7 is now armed.

- que:
  - Where's my gun?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.

- que:
  - You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
  ans:
  - She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.

- que:
  - When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
  ans:
  - On my life, I promise you I will.

- que:
  - Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
  ans:
  - Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.

- que:
  - You think he's smart?
  ans:
  - Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is. But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.

- que:
  - I don't set policy. You have the key?
  ans:
  - Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.

- que:
  - What's the assignment?
  ans:
  - You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.

- que:
  - That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
  ans:
  - Not if you're with him every step of the way.

- que:
  - Think you can do it?
  ans:
  - Not from in here.

- que:
  - What happens if I can't catch him?
  ans:
  - If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.

- que:
  - What did you find out?
  ans:
  - Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.

- que:
  - No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C-4 is missing?
  ans:
  - Enough to level an entire city block.

- que:
  - You know how much man power you're talking about?
  ans:
  - You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.

- que:
  - Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
  ans:
  - Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.

- que:
  - Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
  ans:
  - Don't remind me.

- que:
  - What the hell happened?
  ans:
  - I was assured the problem was corrected.

- que:
  - How does he know who I am?
  ans:
  - He hears...everything.

- que:
  - Do I get to see it or not?
  ans:
  - Bastard... Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

- que:
  - How do you kill it?
  ans:
  - Separate the character module from the neural net...

- que:
  - How should I know?
  ans:
  - Show me his physical sensory level.

- que:
  - Should I have?
  ans:
  - Think hard -- it'll come to you...

- que:
  - My God...
  ans:
  - It was you, wasn't it?

- que:
  - What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
  ans:
  - She's some of your finest work, Daryl.

- que:
  - You catching my drift?
  ans:
  - Of course you are.

- que:
  - How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
  ans:
  - Help me get out of here.

- que:
  - Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
  ans:
  - You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived. What do you think I'm doing?

- que:
  - No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. How you feeling today?
  ans:
  - A little less than yesterday.

- que:
  - In other words, par for the course. How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
  ans:
  - John died.

- que:
  - What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
  ans:
  - Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar.

- que:
  - You ready for this?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.

- que:
  - What happened when he was 17?
  ans:
  - Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers. Stay here.

- que:
  - You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
  ans:
  - Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.

- que:
  - You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
  ans:
  - This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.

- que:
  - I've been in prison, remember?
  ans:
  - The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.

- que:
  - Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
  ans:
  - He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.

- que:
  - Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
  ans:
  - What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
  ans:
  - I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.

- que:
  - She's beautiful, you know?
  ans:
  - Thank-you. Her name is Karin.

- que:
  - Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
  ans:
  - I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.

- que:
  - You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?
  ans:
  - Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.

- que:
  - Don't worry about it, all right?
  ans:
  - Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...

- que:
  - Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
  ans:
  - Don't get out of the car.

- que:
  - What did you do to those people?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Enjoying yourself?
  ans:
  - You know I am.

- que:
  - Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
  ans:
  - What's the problem?

- que:
  - Start of what?
  ans:
  - I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing. Whatever it is, he isn't finished...

- que:
  - You like baseball?
  ans:
  - Real effective security...

- que:
  - You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
  ans:
  - Authority still makes me nervous.

- que:
  - Which way?
  ans:
  - Both.

- que:
  - How did you find out about the toxin?
  ans:
  - Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.

- que:
  - I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
  ans:
  - I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.

- que:
  - The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.

- que:
  - Think he's keeping track of his creation?
  ans:
  - That, or living through him...

- que:
  - See something?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...

- que:
  - Find out anything?
  ans:
  - A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - That's why I'm asking.

- que:
  - ...I think so...You?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - Lindenmeyer?
  ans:
  - My guess is dead.

- que:
  - Sid?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where the hell are you going?
  ans:
  - Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...

- que:
  - How's your pulse?
  ans:
  - You won't want to watch. Turn around.

- que:
  - Performing solo. Enjoying the concert so far?
  ans:
  - The symphony of collision...

- que:
  - DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
  ans:
  - Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.

- que:
  - I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
  ans:
  - There you go  best seat in the house.

- que:
  - Aren't you going to watch with me?
  ans:
  - I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.

- que:
  - Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
  ans:
  - What are you talking about?

- que:
  - At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
  ans:
  - You want some research, flu? Side-effects of medi....

- que:

  ans:
  - Lure him.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.

- que:
  - First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
  ans:
  - Stay here, I'll see what I can do.

- que:
  - What'd you tell him?
  ans:
  - I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...

- que:
  - What if he asks where I got the money?
  ans:
  - Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

- que:
  - What if they call him?
  ans:
  - They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.

- que:
  - Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
  ans:
  - Didn't he tell you? That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.

- que:
  - So, where are we going?
  ans:
  - Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while. Work up an appetite.

  ans:

  ans:
  - Nah, she asked the wrong question.

- que:

  ans:
  - Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.

- que:
  - Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?

- que:
  - More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
  ans:
  - Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.

- que:
  - So what's the problem?
  ans:
  - ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...

- que:
  - Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
  ans:
  - He never told me...

- que:
  - So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?
  ans:

- que:
  - So what firm you with, pal?
  ans:

- que:
  - ...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
  ans:

  ans:
  - My home number's on the back...

- que:
  - Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
  ans:
  - Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.

- que:
  - The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Know the name?
  ans:
  - Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.

- que:
  - I remember that deal. You were involved?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Close to two million. But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.

- que:
  - What makes you think you can?
  ans:
  - I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.

- que:
  - I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
  ans:
  - Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.

- que:
  - Why do you need to wreck this company?
  ans:
  - Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.

- que:
  - How much is enough Gordon?
  ans:
  - Obviously...

- que:
  - Are you with me Buddy?
  ans:
  - Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.

- que:
  - You sandbagged me on Bluestar. I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
  ans:
  - Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.

- que:
  - Stock broker. As in, never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
  ans:
  - I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - Upper West Side.

- que:
  - What if I have a previous engagement?
  ans:
  - Break it.

- que:
  - You really do believe in destiny?
  ans:
  - Only if I want something bad enough.

- que:
  - Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
  ans:
  - He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.

- que:
  - So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
  ans:
  - The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.

- que:
  - And what do you want?
  ans:
  - ...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...

- que:
  - Well, why stop at that?
  ans:
  - I don't.

- que:
  - That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
  ans:
  - You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?

- que:
  - Do you think you're ready?
  ans:
  - I'll let you know.

- que:
  - I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
  ans:
  - Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.

- que:
  - What the hell's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...

- que:
  - How you doing Buddy?
  ans:
  - Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...

- que:
  - Bud! Where you been the last two days?
  ans:
  - ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...

- que:
  - Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
  ans:
  - Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
  ans:
  - Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.

- que:
  - So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
  ans:
  - It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.

- que:
  - You told him about us?
  ans:
  - No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...

- que:
  - Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
  ans:
  - Because I don't want to see him hurt.

- que:
  - Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor. Interesting. You got a card?
  ans:
  - Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.

- que:
  - Are you prepared to put that in writing?
  ans:
  - I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.

- que:
  - Cards are on the table. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm sure. What I need is an older man, something with class, a little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.

- que:
  - But?
  ans:
  - But he still has something Mark hasn't.

- que:
  - We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
  ans:
  - About what? About us.

- que:
  - Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
  ans:
  - Suffer? We're living in America.

- que:
  - Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
  ans:
  - Ok toots, I will.

- que:
  - Hmm.
  ans:
  - Weird and tiny huh?

- que:
  - Good evening sir.
  ans:
  - Would you like a closer look?

- que:
  - Hello, Mrs. Webster. Is China there?
  ans:
  - No Jonathan.

- que:
  - You don't happen to have the address do ya?
  ans:
  - Vell. Goodnight.

- que:
  - What? Tony and China, together?
  ans:
  - Wooo. Jealously rearing its ugly head.

- que:
  - Then why do you still like her?
  ans:
  - Like her? I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just you want what you can't get.

- que:
  - No Mark. MARK Why not?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I really like you and I think you're very attractive.

- que:
  - If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
  ans:
  - A little?

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Well. .this, is Mr. Lincoln. And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.

- que:
  - Anyone else not coming?
  ans:
  - Right behind you.

- que:
  - Any student of Black Magic can do it. .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
  ans:
  - Never fear, Tony is here. Ladies first.

- que:
  - Do you have a scarf?
  ans:
  - Hey.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - It's only two hours away.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Besides, Dad would have freaked.

- que:
  - Are you mad at me?
  ans:
  - Listen to me. The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I started seeing things.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - No. But once I heard...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.

- que:
  - Who's idea was it?
  ans:
  - Mine. His. We both...thought...

- que:
  - Then why did you?
  ans:
  - Because he was worried about me.

- que:
  - Your husband?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.

- que:
  - Do you really think so?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Fireball?
  ans:
  - You're joking.

- que:
  - How do you know it's a she?
  ans:
  - I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub.

- que:
  - What does she look like?
  ans:
  - Pretty. She's a blond.

- que:
  - Do you have any idea who she is?
  ans:
  - Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Try to communicate with her somehow.

- que:
  - You think that'll help?
  ans:
  - Can't hurt. And I think it's important you find out what she wants.

- que:
  - Are you humoring me?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I don't know. My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.

- que:
  - What's happening to me?
  ans:
  - Well, that's what we're here for.

- que:
  - You're saying you willed these events to happen?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I'm very confused right now.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.

- que:
  - How're you holding up?
  ans:
  - Just fine. It's a lovely party.

- que:
  - I'm sorry?
  ans:
  - I know how hard it can be sometimes.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. What can be?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.

- que:
  - Toward the end. You remember?
  ans:
  - Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - The wives.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Um...

- que:
  - When...when will she be back?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Give me that shit. Your wife.

- que:
  - I've seen you. From the window.
  ans:
  - Who are you?

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - I'm not...

- que:
  - Who? Your husband?
  ans:
  - And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of...

- que:
  - What? What are you afraid of?
  ans:
  - I can't, no, no, I can't...

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...

- que:
  - Would you like some iced tea?
  ans:
  - Very much.

- que:
  - Of what? What were you so afraid of?
  ans:
  - You're going to think I'm crazy or something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Um...sure.

- que:
  - Mrs. Frank?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You know where she is?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Claire.

- que:
  - Why are you here?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What was her major?
  ans:
  - Biology. She wanted to be a doctor.

- que:
  - Do we have to?
  ans:
  - And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.

- que:
  - How you holding up?
  ans:
  - Good. I'm good.

- que:
  - Why does everyone find that so surprising?
  ans:
  - Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit.

- que:
  - So you'll have some later. Notice anything...different?
  ans:
  - Oh my god. You bought it.

- que:
  - Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Listen, I've gotta run. I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
  ans:
  - You got it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Seance.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - In the window. Norman's at work.

- que:
  - Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
  ans:
  - Place your fingers on the planchette.

- que:
  - The planchette?
  ans:
  - This.

- que:
  - We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. What's her first name?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Mef? What's Mef?
  ans:
  - It's initials. F is Feur. It's her.

- que:
  - I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
  ans:
  - Are you okay?

- que:
  - Does Norman know?
  ans:
  - Jody, she's alive.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.

- que:
  - Something was there. You saw it.
  ans:
  - Then what was it?

- que:
  - Did I?
  ans:
  - Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...

- que:
  - Hartford?
  ans:
  - And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.

- que:
  - Relieved?
  ans:
  - By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.

- que:
  - Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
  ans:
  - All of us.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - But he acted like he'd never heard of it.

- que:
  - Did he say that?
  ans:
  - Jody he was lying.

- que:
  - What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
  ans:
  - I guess not.

- que:
  - Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
  ans:
  - I think three...

- que:
  - What's their name?
  ans:
  - Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic.

- que:
  - When's she out of here?
  ans:
  - Norman Spencer.

- que:
  - It's today?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Claire?
  ans:
  - Three o'clock.

- que:
  - Whatcha reading?
  ans:
  - Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Tired?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Wanna fool around?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - Of him I think.

- que:
  - Did she say that?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To make sure she's all right.

- que:
  - But what if something happens?
  ans:
  - Claire...

- que:
  - Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something.
  ans:
  - Promise?

- que:
  - Is it gone?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - Claire?
  ans:
  - Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you.

- que:
  - What do you mean? Some noises where?
  ans:
  - In the house. I was scared.

- que:
  - Did you call the police?
  ans:
  - No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning.

- que:
  - What kind of whispering?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Just...whispering.

- que:
  - I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
  ans:
  - Think I may have cracked it.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I think so. Maybe.

- que:
  - Did you tell her?
  ans:
  - What? No. No.

- que:
  - You didn't?
  ans:
  - Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't.

- que:
  - Did you call about the Feurs?
  ans:
  - Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.

- que:
  - What's going on, Claire?
  ans:
  - Shhhh.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one.

- que:
  - A flare?
  ans:
  - From the sun. It's a reflection on the glass.

- que:
  - Where is she then?
  ans:
  - She could be out. She could be sick in bed for all we know.

- que:
  - What am I looking at?
  ans:
  - I didn't do that.

- que:
  - Who did? Mrs. Feur?
  ans:
  - Maybe. Point is...not me.

- que:
  - Dressed?
  ans:
  - Dinner. With Stan and his new girl.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - What do you mean? Claire, we talked about it. You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...

- que:
  - Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
  ans:
  - ...since Caitlin. You don't remember this?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Restaurant. Let them know we're running late.

- que:
  - Five minutes?
  ans:
  - You're not at the center.

- que:
  - What can it hurt to talk to someone?
  ans:
  - Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years. If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.

- que:
  - This is the Feur thing?
  ans:
  - Yes. And he's going to get away with it.

- que:
  - How do you know this?
  ans:
  - We had a seance.

- que:
  - Who did?
  ans:
  - Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Maybe you resent how busy I've been.

- que:
  - Sabotage?
  ans:
  - Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...

- que:
  - The accident...?
  ans:
  - But then you've been so much better...

- que:
  - ...I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for dinner. Sure you won't stay?
  ans:
  - No, it's fine. I'm fine.

- que:
  - Do I have everything?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Are you glad? I'm glad.

- que:
  - You don't remember?
  ans:
  - When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.

- que:
  - What's wrong with me?

- que:
  - I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?

  - No she didn't...

- que:
  - I don't know...
  ans:
  - What did you do with her?

- que:
  - Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
  ans:
  - Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?

- que:
  - How long have you been watching me?
  ans:
  - I have something I have to show you...

- que:
  - Tell me how it happened...
  ans:
  - What didn't you like about her?

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.

- que:
  - What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
  ans:
  - I want it to stop - it all to stop...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing could be better...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Open it...

- que:
  - I am sorry...
  ans:
  - Where are you going?

- que:
  - LESLIE? Is that good enough?
  ans:
  - Yes - I suppose so...

- que:

  ans:
  - Get out...

- que:
  - You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...

- que:
  - I thought it was you - how are you?
  ans:
  - I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...

- que:
  - Dead?
  ans:
  - Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.

- que:
  - Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
  ans:
  - So she didn't mention anything more about it?

- que:
  - Sugar?
  ans:
  - Yes - one please.

- que:
  - See? Did you see that?
  ans:
  - She smiles at everyone, Ted. She's like a newborn with gas.

- que:
  - Were you always this sick?
  ans:
  - One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.

- que:
  - What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
  ans:
  - Astronomical.

- que:
  - Who the hell was your father?
  ans:
  - Well, Dad said...

- que:
  - ...A bouncer? Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Maybe he got promoted.

- que:
  - I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
  ans:
  - This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.

- que:
  - You kiss your mother with that mouth?
  ans:
  - I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...

- que:
  - So far away? In Xenia?
  ans:
  - Yeah, whatever.

- que:
  - Don't tell me. Another vision of incomparable beauty?
  ans:
  - Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.

- que:
  - Dead?
  ans:
  - Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.

- que:
  - Brilliant! Molly, give me all you've got. For Merk.
  ans:
  - How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?

- que:
  - Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
  ans:
  - We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.

- que:
  - These are real, live women?
  ans:
  - We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.

- que:
  - What gives, Don Corleone?
  ans:
  - We reinvented ourselves.

- que:
  - Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
  ans:
  - From your lips, to God's ears.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - And I was wondering.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - If you don't have...I mean...

- que:
  - Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
  ans:
  - SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.

- que:
  - Ted, have you lost your mind?
  ans:
  - You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.

- que:
  - So that's a maybe?
  ans:
  - The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.

- que:
  - Yeah? You like?
  ans:
  - Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.

- que:
  - You know...take the pictures?
  ans:
  - I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - You have changed since second grade.

- que:
  - I mean, what do you think?
  ans:
  - You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.

- que:
  - Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - God, you are so hot.

- que:
  - We can't accept it. It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
  ans:
  - Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...

- que:
  - Sweetheart, what is it?
  ans:
  - I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.

- que:
  - Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
  ans:
  - We miss you. We miss our son.

- que:
  - The lesson being?
  ans:
  - Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.

- que:
  - Well, why should I?
  ans:
  - They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.

- que:
  - Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
  ans:
  - I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.

- que:
  - Like one of those \"National Geographic\" specials with the topless chicks?
  ans:
  - Whatever helps you cope.

- que:
  - I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
  ans:
  - Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.

- que:
  - You ordered a Winnebago?
  ans:
  - THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.

- que:
  - You do know how to drive?
  ans:
  - I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.

- que:
  - Want a lesson?
  ans:
  - Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.

- que:
  - Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
  ans:
  - Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.

- que:
  - Who exactly ARE you?
  ans:
  - What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.

- que:
  - And who IS Ted Nelson?
  ans:
  - Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.

- que:
  - After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
  ans:
  - Whatever you want.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.

- que:
  - Can you believe that was me?
  ans:
  - Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.

- que:
  - You mean they knew who I was?
  ans:
  - They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.

- que:
  - How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
  ans:
  - Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.

- que:
  - Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
  ans:
  - You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.

- que:
  - Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
  ans:
  - She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.

- que:
  - It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
  ans:
  - Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.

- que:
  - So, what brings you here at his hour?
  ans:
  - My new bike.

- que:
  - My room?
  ans:
  - Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.

- que:
  - You want it in writing?
  ans:
  - Just a formality.

- que:
  - Are they okay?
  ans:
  - I miss them, too.

- que:
  - Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
  ans:
  - Look, I loved \"Exposed!\" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.

- que:
  - What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
  ans:
  - Your article sucked.

- que:
  - In what sense?
  ans:
  - In the sense that there is no \"hidden agenda\" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - \"Local boy inherits more money than god.\" Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.

- que:
  - Really? You wanna write about me?
  ans:
  - I have to admit, I always felt... different.

- que:
  - Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
  ans:
  - I don't get the distinction.

- que:
  - Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
  ans:
  - I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.

- que:
  - Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
  ans:
  - Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.

- que:
  - Well? What do you think of her?
  ans:
  - You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.

- que:
  - You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
  ans:
  - Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.

- que:
  - Why can't you be nice to me?
  ans:
  - You've got enough people kissing your ass.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - To the best hiding place in the world.

- que:
  - And then what?
  ans:
  - Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.

- que:
  - He's on the move?
  ans:
  - I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.

- que:
  - You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
  ans:
  - At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.

- que:
  - Wearing them? Or humping them?
  ans:
  - My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - I'm very aural.

- que:
  - Do you trust me, Julie?
  ans:
  - Not a chance.

- que:
  - Which explains the continued success of \"Heaven\" for how many decades?
  ans:
  - You're quick. I like that.

- que:
  - You think you're working with chimps here?
  ans:
  - The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.

- que:
  - Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
  ans:
  - I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.

- que:
  - Yellow pages?
  ans:
  - Let your fingers do the walking.

- que:
  - They're playing our song. Dare I ask for this dance?
  ans:
  - You better.

- que:
  - What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
  ans:
  - No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.

- que:
  - What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
  ans:
  - What about Charlie? You boys could make it a little adventure.

- que:
  - Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
  ans:
  - I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.

- que:
  - Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking good care of you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm doing fine. I have so much to tell you. I don't even know where to begin.

- que:
  - What is all this? When are you coming home?
  ans:
  - Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.

- que:
  - Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
  ans:
  - Only the best for my mother.

- que:
  - You promise you'll finish school?
  ans:
  - I'll make you very proud.

- que:
  - But how would we pay our bills?
  ans:
  - Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.

- que:
  - But who would run the store?
  ans:
  - Forget the store. Think big.

- que:
  - Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
  ans:
  - Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.

- que:
  - You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
  ans:
  - That's a good start, yes. A very good start.

- que:
  - You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
  ans:
  - I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?

- que:
  - A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
  ans:
  - I'm warning you.

- que:
  - What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
  ans:
  - Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.

- que:
  - You called the cops on us?
  ans:
  - Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.

- que:
  - You do like girls, don't you?
  ans:
  - Of course I like girls.

- que:
  - A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
  ans:
  - As much as possible.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.

- que:
  - Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
  ans:
  - Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.

- que:
  - There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Everything's cool.

- que:
  - YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
  ans:
  - You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.

- que:
  - Me? The King of Coitus?
  ans:
  - The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.

- que:
  - Really? You'd do that for me?
  ans:
  - I've been very lazy for a long, long time.

- que:
  - You think we should be more open minded?
  ans:
  - The world is a big, beautiful place. We can open new markets in Africa and Asia. Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.

- que:
  - Really? So I'm doing OK?
  ans:
  - My father must've been amazing.

- que:
  - Seriously? I'm doing all right?
  ans:
  - I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - My job. Back off, Benedict.

- que:
  - I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
  ans:
  - Bad news.

- que:
  - People pay good money for that?
  ans:
  - I'm just a messenger.

- que:
  - My parents? What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.

- que:
  - So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
  ans:
  - I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie.

- que:
  - How you doing, Artie?
  ans:
  - I... You know... I...

- que:
  - Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
  ans:
  - Kelly.

- que:
  - She's going to wash your Jeep?
  ans:
  - Senior class fund-raising gig. I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep. Hey, come on. It's for a good cause.

- que:
  - And where might that be?
  ans:
  - I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

- que:
  - How soon can we get something?
  ans:
  - We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer. You want DNA, that can take weeks.

- que:
  - The teeth doin' any talkin'?
  ans:
  - Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...

- que:
  - What about the blood?
  ans:
  - Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...

- que:
  - What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
  ans:
  - Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.

- que:
  - You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
  ans:
  - I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

- que:
  - About Suzie?
  ans:
  - Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.

- que:
  - She still work there?
  ans:
  - Was there ever any kind of investigation...

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. Nice TV.

- que:
  - How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
  ans:
  - I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.

- que:
  - Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you?
  ans:
  - Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me...

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - He kept saying, \"Let it happen, let it happen.\" Then he just stopped.

- que:
  - And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
  ans:
  - Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab.

- que:
  - Did you call anyone? Did you call her house to see if she got home? Did you call the Masons?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
  ans:
  - Suzie Toller is missing.

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.

- que:
  - Suzie?
  ans:
  - I've got that two o'clock in town.

- que:
  - That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
  ans:
  - All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.

- que:
  - You're telling me you believe the guy?
  ans:
  - All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.

- que:
  - You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
  ans:
  - The skinny brunette.

- que:
  - Lombardo's settlement?
  ans:
  - Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.

- que:
  - Unless what?
  ans:
  - Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.

- que:
  - This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - Eliminate the competition.

- que:
  - Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
  ans:
  - I net a guy in a bar.

- que:
  - Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
  ans:
  - We all have...

- que:
  - You have someplace to be?
  ans:
  - If you want company...

- que:
  - Where's the body?
  ans:
  - The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake.

- que:
  - You don't think Sam could've put it there?
  ans:
  - Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.

- que:
  - Will you do me one favor?
  ans:
  - Ray, you heard him...

- que:
  - What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
  ans:
  - Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you...

- que:
  - And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
  ans:
  - If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.

- que:
  - Where's Lombardo?
  ans:
  - He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.

- que:
  - That bothers you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, maybe, a little.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.

- que:
  - We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
  ans:
  - About a year ago.

- que:
  - He dropped Jimmy off first?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did he come in with you?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - At that point were you able to fight him off?
  ans:
  - No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go.

- que:
  - Where's this coming from?
  ans:
  - I want a full-scale investigation.

- que:
  - What about witnesses?
  ans:
  - We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.

- que:
  - Are you crazy, Ray?
  ans:
  - You heard Kelly say \"Sam.\" That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls...

- que:
  - I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
  ans:
  - Just tell us what happened.

- que:
  - She bit you?
  ans:
  - I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together.

- que:
  - You didn't cuff her?
  ans:
  - The teeth, were they...

- que:
  - I wanna go home now.
  ans:
  - You guess? Did he or didn't he?

- que:
  - What did you do then?
  ans:
  - Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

- que:
  - Okay! He did. He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. Now, can I go home?
  ans:
  - He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.

- que:
  - I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why?
  ans:
  - Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.

- que:
  - Ms. Toller?
  ans:
  - I said he did.

- que:
  - Ms. Toller. I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
  ans:
  - This wasn't my idea.

- que:
  - I'm sorry?
  ans:
  - Your Honor... Please...

- que:
  - Hey, you're working for it. Least you're supposed to be.
  ans:
  - Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it?

- que:
  - A ride. You want one?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But I got my bike.

- que:
  - I say something funny?
  ans:
  - No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...

- que:
  - I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.

- que:
  - You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Oh, for Christ's sake.

- que:
  - What are you looking at?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Is there some reason why you're here?
  ans:
  - Curiosity, I guess.

- que:
  - You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
  ans:
  - The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.

- que:
  - You notice my new jumper?
  ans:
  - My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.

- que:
  - Kelly. What is it?
  ans:
  - I miss Dad.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I was raped. By Sam Lombardo.

- que:
  - He... Sam Lombardo?
  ans:
  - Yes. God, Mom...

- que:
  - Where, the mall?
  ans:
  - A friend of mine bought a boat.

- que:
  - Deal. You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?
  ans:
  - Don't forget the car wash.

- que:
  - So, where you off to now?
  ans:
  - Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - So you got my mom's money.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - About six and a half million dollars.

- que:
  - Do it to ourselves?
  ans:
  - We have to stick with the plan.

- que:
  - Kelly. Is Suzie there?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
  ans:
  - Why can't you come...

- que:
  - Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - And you believe her?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I want to see you...

- que:
  - You think that's wise?
  ans:
  - Um-huh. And guess what else? I have toys.

- que:
  - Can't you take that stupid thing off?
  ans:
  - Not in here. Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Nellie Gail Ranch...

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.

- que:
  - Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
  ans:
  - I'm placing your daughter under arrest.

- que:
  - So Suzie, you called us, remember?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Will they?
  ans:
  - It doesn't look like it.

- que:
  - Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
  ans:
  - You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.

- que:
  - You got something against cigarettes?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you...

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.

- que:
  - Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
  ans:
  - You, Kelly, Sam.

- que:
  - Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you?
  ans:
  - I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends...

- que:
  - Hey, Ray. Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
  ans:
  - Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.

- que:
  - But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules?
  ans:
  - It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...

- que:
  - Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?
  ans:
  - The bitch shot me, is what happened.

- que:
  - Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
  ans:
  - Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.

- que:
  - You mean this thing?
  ans:
  - Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays.

- que:
  - I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
  ans:
  - Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

- que:
  - Jesus, man... You okay?
  ans:
  - That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...

- que:
  - How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
  ans:
  - Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.

- que:
  - Shut up. Don't fall apart. The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
  ans:
  - Yeah, right.

- que:
  - Are you mad at me?
  ans:
  - No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That was the same thing Ray said.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.

- que:
  - We?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.

- que:
  - What? You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
  ans:
  - Hi, Sandy.

- que:
  - Why don't you come in, have a drink?
  ans:
  - Can't. Got a passenger.

- que:
  - Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Didn't you see her this morning?
  ans:
  - To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.

- que:
  - Look. I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter. So what?
  ans:
  - So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

- que:
  - I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
  ans:
  - Valet? You jest of course. I am a U.S. Marshal.

- que:
  - Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are. So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
  ans:
  - You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.

- que:
  - Put them all together and what do we have?
  ans:
  - A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes? Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.

- que:
  - Then why kidnap them? Why not just kill them?
  ans:
  - \"Ay, there's the rub.\" Take a look at this file on Professor Morton. Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.

- que:
  - You need that real often?
  ans:
  - Always hoping. Or this...

- que:
  - Try what?
  ans:
  - Yes, aha. A brass screw.

- que:
  - Limestone quarry?
  ans:
  - Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.

- que:
  - Prepare what?
  ans:
  - My disguise. And here...

- que:
  - Then we've got our proof. Excellent. And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
  ans:
  - You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.

- que:
  - Almost?
  ans:
  - Yes. Now, observe....

- que:
  - You feeling all right?
  ans:
  - Come on, Jim. I'm serious. Dot... Dash. It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.

- que:
  - Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
  ans:
  - Now, what was that?

- que:
  - All what?
  ans:
  - All that jumping and kicking.

- que:
  - Jim, are you all right?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.

- que:
  - What way is that?
  ans:
  - So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.

- que:
  - So... what happened?
  ans:
  - Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.

- que:
  - Uh... how long ago was this?
  ans:
  - I was six. And ever since, my policy is, Act first and worry later.

- que:
  - Can you fill me in here?
  ans:
  - Sure. We have no idea what's going on.

- que:
  - Know what this is?
  ans:
  - Sure. It's a wind-up... thing.

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.

- que:
  - And people are actually fooled by that?
  ans:
  - Not again.

- que:
  - You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
  ans:
  - When we find him, he is mine.

- que:
  - What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
  ans:
  - Not likely. There must be tracks of twenty different wagons. Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...

- que:
  - I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
  ans:
  - There's only seventy-eight.

- que:
  - Are those just button buttons or...?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - In the next two minutes?
  ans:
  - Artemus! Look at that. Brand spanking new. She's a beauty, huh? Let's get rolling.

- que:
  - Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders?
  ans:
  - Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.

- que:
  - He's not giving up?
  ans:
  - We'll see.

- que:
  - Anyone?
  ans:
  - Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.

- que:
  - Your guests, ma'am?
  ans:
  - Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.

- que:
  - Well, I owe you one, don't I?
  ans:
  - You most certainly do.

- que:
  - Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
  ans:
  - You tell me.

- que:
  - Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - I suppose so. But life can be hard for a man, too.

- que:
  - Would that include me?
  ans:
  - Oh, I would hope not.

- que:
  - Really? Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
  ans:
  - My. It's gotten longer.

- que:
  - Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
  ans:
  - Well, yes sir. A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...

- que:
  - French?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - And now the job's yours.

- que:
  - ... well, of course you can. Mr. President, what a surprise. What brings you here?
  ans:
  - On my way to Denver...

- que:
  - Where'd he say he was going to do this?
  ans:
  - He didn't. That's your job. I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck. Nice train. But mine's nicer.

- que:
  - When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
  ans:
  - I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.

- que:
  - How embarrassing. Did I hold up three fingers?
  ans:
  - Why don't we just cut this routine short? Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.

- que:
  - Dr. Loveless?
  ans:
  - The U.S. is my jurisdiction.

- que:
  - The first.
  ans:
  - That would be... the Mexican War?

- que:
  - So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
  ans:
  - Easy now.

- que:
  - Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
  ans:
  - Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy!?

- que:
  - Who were they? What do they want with me?
  ans:
  - We'll explain on the way.

- que:
  - Who was this partner of his?
  ans:
  - A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - For the moment. But I fear not for long. I'm of no use to him now.

- que:
  - He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
  ans:
  - He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - They're coming.

- que:
  - You're not going to use it, are you?
  ans:
  - Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...

- que:
  - It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan. What did you do this time?
  ans:
  - They're not after me. They want the baby.

- que:
  - Willow Ufgood.
  ans:
  - Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?

- que:
  - Yes...?
  ans:
  - I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...

- que:
  - You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
  ans:
  - She belongs to all of us. She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - You are the guardian, Willow. You must take her to Tir Asleen.

- que:
  - What is Tir Asleen?
  ans:
  - You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.

- que:
  - If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
  ans:
  - You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow.

- que:
  - You! Are you the mother of that child?
  ans:
  - No. I mean yes.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Gawd...you're...beautiful...

- que:
  - Say what?
  ans:
  - I love you.

- que:
  - Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
  ans:
  - Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

- que:
  - We're a tiny version of all that?
  ans:
  - As above, so below.

- que:
  - Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
  ans:
  - Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here.

- que:
  - Good. How long will it take?
  ans:
  - Don't make me angry, Peck.

- que:
  - Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
  ans:
  - Why.

- que:
  - I don't know.
  ans:
  - Are you okay?

- que:
  - You a woodcutter?
  ans:
  - Farmer.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - These burns. My arms. Ouch...

- que:
  - Are you a warrior?
  ans:
  - The greatest swordsman that ever lived.

- que:
  - Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
  ans:
  - I hate this.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh? I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.

- que:
  - The Fairy Queen? And the baby here's a princess? And these two rodents are your guides?
  ans:
  - Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream.

- que:
  - She asked about you, Madmartigan.
  ans:
  - Did she ask about me?

- que:
  - Well what did she say?
  ans:
  - She's in love.

- que:
  - What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
  ans:
  - Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closed-in places.

- que:
  - Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
  ans:
  - She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.

- que:
  - Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter. She is all that matters. Are you going to abandon her?
  ans:
  - It's not a Nelwyn baby.

- que:
  - Can't we keep it, Dada?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not.

- que:
  - Dada, what's a daikini?
  ans:
  - Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.

- que:
  - Did give that acorn its power?
  ans:
  - We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.

- que:
  - I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this?
  ans:
  - Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you...

- que:
  - I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
  ans:
  - As below, so above. You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.

- que:
  - I'm all finished. Now what?
  ans:
  - Burn it to a fine ash.

- que:
  - How am I gonna do that?
  ans:
  - The limitless power of...

- que:

  - Who was that man?
  ans:
  - His name is John Book.

- que:
  - Is the English dead?

  ans:
  - They don't have any shit.

- que:
  - Nobody's going to hurt your son...
  ans:
  - All right, where is he?

- que:
  - Is this where we're going?
  ans:
  - Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.

- que:
  - To see?
  ans:
  - If she...

- que:
  - ...have you come back?
  ans:
  - Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.

- que:
  - You are?
  ans:
  - Uhhhh -- yes...

- que:
  - ...didn't you?
  ans:
  - Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.

- que:
  - Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
  ans:
  - No, I'm afraid I didn't.

- que:
  - But, how do I start for Emerald City?
  ans:
  - It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.

- que:
  - Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?
  ans:
  - You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.

- que:
  - ...Toto, too?
  ans:
  - Toto, too.

- que:
  - Oh, now?
  ans:
  - Whenever you wish.

- que:
  - Are you ready now?
  ans:
  - Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.

- que:
  - Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
  ans:
  - Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....

- que:
  - That's right. What's she doing?
  ans:
  - Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.

- que:
  - Has it poppies on the wall....
  ans:
  - What's she doing now?

- que:
  - ...paper?
  ans:
  - That dog's a menace to the community. I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.

- que:
  - Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
  ans:
  - Now you're seeing reason.

- que:
  - Did you say something?
  ans:
  - Oil can....

- que:
  - Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

- que:
  - Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
  ans:
  - Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.

- que:
  - Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
  ans:
  - I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.

- que:
  - Still, I wish I could remember. But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?
  ans:
  - We might.

- que:
  - Oh, he's just ascared again.
  ans:
  - Can't that female take no for an answer?

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?

- que:
  - In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King! If....
  ans:
  - Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?

- que:
  - I'd sooner wait outside.
  ans:
  - Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?

- que:
  - Oh -- Oh, come on.
  ans:
  - But why? Why?

- que:
  - Does it work?
  ans:
  - No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.

- que:
  - Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
  ans:
  - I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.

- que:
  - Where's Kansas?
  ans:
  - That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

- que:
  - You're going to see a Wizard?
  ans:
  - Um-hmm.

- que:
  - Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
  ans:
  - I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.

- que:
  - Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
  ans:
  - Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!

- que:
  - ...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
  ans:
  - To Oz?

- que:
  - Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
  ans:
  - Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?

- que:
  - Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
  ans:
  - I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.

- que:
  - Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
  ans:
  - ...ting the ruby slippers?

- que:
  - It did?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Somebody pulled my tail.

- que:
  - And you're going to lead us.
  ans:
  - What was that?

- que:
  - Yeah. Me?
  ans:
  - Yes, you.

- que:
  - I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Oh, scared, huh?
  ans:
  - I haven't slept in weeks.

- que:
  - Why don't you try counting sheep?
  ans:
  - That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.

- que:
  - Whozat?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - We do.
  ans:
  - Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?

- que:
  - Animals that -- that eat straw?
  ans:
  - Oh - look out.

- que:
  - It's a whozis.
  ans:
  - You know something?

- que:
  - Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You promised us real things -- a real...
  ans:
  - What about us?

- que:
  - How can I ever thank you enough?
  ans:
  - Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.

- que:
  - What happened to Len Tashka?
  ans:
  - Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.

- que:
  - Bond --
  ans:
  - So who are you?

- que:
  - When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
  ans:
  - Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.

- que:
  - Whos she?
  ans:
  - Elektra King.

- que:
  - What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
  ans:
  - I was hoping you could tell me.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now. And Ms life is part of the bet.

- que:
  - Is there another way?
  ans:
  - We go down to the torpedo bay.

- que:
  - Do you know what youre doing?
  ans:
  - Like riding a bike.

- que:
  - What kind of bikes did you ride?
  ans:
  - Just wanted to put him on edge...

- que:
  - So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
  ans:
  - Dislocated collar bone. If any more tendons snap... It wont just be two weeks out of action.

- que:
  - Perhaps after this ... test?
  ans:
  - ...yes?...

- que:
  - I could come for a second opinion?
  ans:
  - Constructions not exactly my line.

- que:
  - Old friend?
  ans:
  - Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.

- que:
  - 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
  ans:
  - And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.

- que:
  - Who told you to look at Elektras files?
  ans:
  - I took the initiative.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Claude Serrault. A.K.A...

- que:
  - He survived?
  ans:
  - That which does not kill me makes me stronger.

- que:
  - The inside man?
  ans:
  - Is maybe...the inside woman.

- que:
  - Who did you get it from?
  ans:
  - I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...

- que:
  - Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
  ans:
  - Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - You will never touch her. You will never get near her.

- que:
  - Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
  ans:
  - Consider me ungrateful.

- que:
  - Beautiful, isnt it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You knew him well?
  ans:
  - He was my father.

- que:
  - Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
  ans:
  - Partially, yes.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette.

- que:
  - Does this look familiar to you?
  ans:
  - Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.

- que:
  - Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
  ans:
  - If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...

- que:
  - You dont take no for an answer, do you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - ...you should rest.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing here?
  ans:
  - If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Surely you believe in living dangerously.

- que:
  - How did you survive?
  ans:
  - I used my body on the guards. It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance. Ive never told anyone that.

- que:
  - ...what?
  ans:
  - We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...

- que:
  - Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
  ans:
  - You can drop the act, its over.

- que:
  - Wheres M?
  ans:
  - Soon shell be everywhere.

- que:
  - All this, because you fell for Renard?
  ans:
  - Five more turns and your neck will break.

- que:
  - No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
  ans:
  - Was this all about the oil?

- que:
  - Know what happens when a man is strangled?
  ans:
  - Elektra, its not too late. Eight million people neednt die.

- que:
  - One... last... screw?
  ans:
  - Oh James.

- que:
  - BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
  ans:
  - You, of course. I need some information.

- que:
  - How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
  ans:
  - What? This is not possible.

- que:
  - Where did you get this?
  ans:
  - Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.

- que:
  - How high up does this...arms dealing go?
  ans:
  - Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.

- que:
  - What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing?
  ans:
  - Shes no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.

- que:
  - Whats your business with Elektra King?
  ans:
  - I thought you were the one in her business.

- que:
  - She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for?
  ans:
  - As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.

- que:
  - No. The truth! She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for?
  ans:
  - Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff.

- que:
  - And the payoff on the tables?
  ans:
  - A special job. A...a...a submarine.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Istanbul.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.

- que:
  - What class sub does your nephew run?
  ans:
  - C-class.

- que:
  - Could...could you come?
  ans:
  - Perhaps this isnt the time...

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.

- que:
  - How would you know?
  ans:
  - Why are you like this? Because Bond is dead? Its what you wanted.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - This is the end.

- que:
  - Everythings under control up here. Are you ready?
  ans:
  - Yes. Au revoir...

- que:
  - Do we have the range of Renards plane?
  ans:
  - Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

- que:
  - Any word from him?
  ans:
  - Still no contact yet.

- que:
  - Why? What's the problem?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you that. It is quite urgent.

- que:
  - What about our end?
  ans:
  - Well, sir ... in a worst-case scenario ... we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

- que:
  - What kind of time frame are we talking about?
  ans:
  - Thirty minutes maximum. Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.

- que:
  - What about the aftermath? This so-called ... \"nuclear winter\" theory?
  ans:
  - We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability ... may depend on a quirk of the weather.

- que:
  - No idea who's behind this?
  ans:
  - Small army, from the looks of it. He put up one hell of a fight.

- que:
  - Washington?
  ans:
  - They want in. Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.

- que:
  - Wrong answers?
  ans:
  - There's no right or wrong. But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you. I want to help you. I want to know all about you.

- que:
  - And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
  ans:
  - Why, doctor. I did. He was a bad dog.

- que:
  - Walter. This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors. In your mind ... what gives you the right to judge?
  ans:
  - Hi, Jon.

- que:
  - What's your theory?
  ans:
  - Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts. They don't concern me.

- que:
  - WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
  ans:
  - Jon! Get back! You don't understand.

- que:
  - Blake? Dead?
  ans:
  - Yes. I heard this morning. Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.

- que:
  - Is it time? D'you have to leave for the funeral?
  ans:
  - Not yet, there's plenty of time.

- que:
  - Would you like me to stay?
  ans:
  - Mm hmm.

- que:
  - ... And just how would you manage that?
  ans:
  - I'm not here. I'm still on Mars. I've come to collect you.

- que:
  - Collect me?
  ans:
  - Yes. In about ... thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.

- que:
  - Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
  ans:
  - Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

- que:
  - Jon -- there's something I have to know. Did you love me once?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet. I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.

- que:
  - Jon -- what?
  ans:
  - The south pole. Times flowing backwards.

- que:
  - Jon, where are we?
  ans:
  - Veidts complex.

- que:
  - The Comedian. He's dead. Murdered. That's all I know.
  ans:
  - Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?

- que:
  - My God. Murdered? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
  ans:
  - It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory. He thinks someone's ... I don't know, stalking us.

- que:
  - Good night.
  ans:
  - If he comes here, I'll handle him. Remember -- I've always protected you. Haven't I? Do you need money?

- que:
  - I don't know, but ... in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right. Is Laurie okay?
  ans:
  - She's with me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I couldn't let him interfere with my project.

- que:
  - Good Lord. How'd you get it on tape?
  ans:
  - It's not on tape. It's live. We're watching it happen.

- que:
  - I've seen them! I've seen them in there.
  ans:
  - What is it? How does it work?

- que:
  - And what if youre wrong?
  ans:
  - Im not.

- que:
  - Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me. Christ! Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
  ans:
  - What if youre wrong?

- que:
  - You ruthless son of a bitch. You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
  ans:
  - We'd better hope so. -- It's almost time.

- que:
  - Sorry, it's this thing with Blake. I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
  ans:
  - Damn straight.

- que:
  - That's the one. Whatever happened to him?
  ans:
  - He pulled it on Rorschach ... and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.

- que:
  - Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing. Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you ... How about you, Laurie?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. No expense account. No place to live.

- que:
  - No, screw that. What you were saying before, it's absolutely right. -- I'd love to have you stay.
  ans:
  - Maybe not, but why take chances?

- que:
  - His what?
  ans:
  - His ... whatever.

- que:
  - I'm not his ... whatever. Okay?
  ans:
  - I told you I was a little bit out of step. A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.

- que:
  - I don't mind getting older. I'm obsolete anyway. Why try to hide it?
  ans:
  - I like the way you look. It's strange with Jon. He doesn't age. His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look ...

- que:
  - Old?
  ans:
  - Not at all. You look very -- dashing. Here, you pick one.

- que:
  - ... What?
  ans:
  - Pick a record. I feel like dancing.

- que:
  - I just realized. I'd never seen his face. I guess it was just a matter of time. He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - The Comedian ... Jon ... now Rorschach.

- que:
  - Ohh. I could use some dinner. Who was that on the phone?
  ans:
  - One more down. Someone tried to kill Adrian... . First time I've ever heard him scared.

- que:
  - Enough is enough, Daniel. Where exactly are we?
  ans:
  - Memory lane.

- que:
  - Antarctica?
  ans:
  - Would you want to sit out a war? I mean -- what would be left.

- que:
  - What are you up to?
  ans:
  - It's a peace rally. The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.

- que:
  - The costumes. Am I right?
  ans:
  - No way. I'm not that much of a pervert.

- que:
  - You're full of yourself. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Long as we're on the subject of perverts ... I miss Rorschach. Let's spring him.

- que:
  - What's he doing?
  ans:
  - I think he's going to the john.

- que:
  - Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
  ans:
  - Welcome back, Night Owl.

- que:
  - He saved himself. He changed the past.
  ans:
  - What now? Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

- que:
  - We'll tell them what's happened. They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
  ans:
  - Hiya, pardner. Long time no see.

- que:
  - Did anybody follow you? See you come here?
  ans:
  - Sure. You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

- que:
  - Hey. Hey. If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
  ans:
  - ... That was quick.

- que:
  - What new information?
  ans:
  - Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU. Dr. Manhattan somehow involved ...

- que:
  - Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us? What about all those poor shits with cancer?
  ans:
  - I don't think she's coming with us.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - The guidance system's fried. I had to switch to manual. -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

- que:
  - What caused it?
  ans:
  - Don't know. Nothing I can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast.

- que:
  - Adrian. What are you doing? Why wouldn't you let us in?
  ans:
  - He's the one. He's been the one all along. Stalking us.

- que:
  - With lots of ketchup?
  ans:
  - Nothing wrong with ketchup.

- que:
  - Janey, will you marry me?
  ans:
  - I can fix it.

- que:
  - -- What?
  ans:
  - My dad's a watchmaker. I'll put it back together for you. Better than ever.

- que:
  - No comment.
  ans:
  - Thanks, no. But it's a wonderful product. Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --

- que:
  - What are you saying? That Jon is radioactive?
  ans:
  - I'm terribly sorry.

- que:
  - Am I free to go?
  ans:
  - You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please. Let's move it.

- que:
  - And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
  ans:
  - I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I. I'll ring for the guards.

- que:
  - New information.
  ans:
  - ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!! -- How'd you find me?

- que:
  - Ever see one of these before?
  ans:
  - Too important for telephone. Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan. All linked up.

- que:
  - What is that ungodly smell?
  ans:
  - Bigger than I thought. CTU involved ...

- que:
  - What is this place?
  ans:
  - Looks like a diner.

- que:
  - That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
  ans:
  - Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.

- que:
  - Is that a fact?
  ans:
  - Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.

- que:
  - Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
  ans:
  - There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.

- que:
  - What do I get out of it?
  ans:
  - Not bad for a gimp.

- que:
  - How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I spy or I die.

- que:
  - Is that all?
  ans:
  - We're not after car thieves here.

- que:
  - You did say \"Ahab\"? You're sure about that?
  ans:
  - This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this \"Ahab\".

- que:
  - Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
  ans:
  - Yes it does.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.

- que:
  - I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
  ans:
  - You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.

- que:
  - Who says you're the good guys?
  ans:
  - You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.

- que:
  - No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
  ans:
  - All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.

- que:
  - What do you have?
  ans:
  - He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.

- que:
  - How will you fix it?
  ans:
  - So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.

- que:
  - You what? A wire transfer of this size?
  ans:
  - If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.

- que:
  - Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
  ans:
  - Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.

- que:
  - Whatchu doing here?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.

- que:
  - We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
  ans:
  - We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.

- que:
  - What game is that?
  ans:
  - Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called \"Anarchy 99\", they're the bad guy bosses.

- que:
  - \"Anarchy\" 99\"?
  ans:
  - What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.

- que:
  - What do you get if you finish?
  ans:
  - Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - He gets to be the hero.

- que:
  - Do you know what a wire transfer is?
  ans:
  - Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.

- que:
  - If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
  ans:
  - Yorgi asked me to.

- que:
  - You do everything Yorgi says?
  ans:
  - Go to hell.

- que:
  - It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
  ans:
  - Mind your business.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.

- que:
  - I was invited. What's your story?
  ans:
  - I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.

- que:
  - We hung out last night, remember?
  ans:
  - Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.

- que:
  - I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
  ans:
  - That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.

- que:
  - So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
  ans:
  - Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.

- que:
  - So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
  ans:
  - They tell me you're an American agent.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.

- que:
  - So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
  ans:
  - No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.

- que:
  - We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
  ans:
  - There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.

- que:
  - You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
  ans:
  - I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.

- que:
  - I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
  ans:
  - When can I see you again?

- que:
  - What are you doing with the Ivans?
  ans:
  - I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.

- que:
  - No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
  ans:
  - We can't leave now. We have to do something.

- que:
  - Aren't you afraid?
  ans:
  - I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.

- que:
  - Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
  ans:
  - When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.

- que:
  - Did you do your homework?
  ans:
  - If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.

- que:
  - Where's he headed?
  ans:
  - He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.

- que:
  - You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
  ans:
  - It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.

- que:
  - What was that for?
  ans:
  - I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.

- que:
  - Nice place to start, don't you think?
  ans:
  - That's would be me.

- que:
  - They come in any other styles or colors?
  ans:
  - This is your standard dart gun.

- que:
  - You're joking, right?
  ans:
  - Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.

- que:
  - I'm having fun, what's the problem?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...

- que:
  - French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
  ans:
  - Alright, so I'll get more.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - I was gonna wait till the islands, but...

- que:
  - This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.

- que:
  - You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
  ans:
  - I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.

- que:
  - Is this what you're looking for?
  ans:
  - Sorry, \"dude\".

- que:
  - Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
  ans:
  - A parachute. This does not argue well.

- que:
  - Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
  ans:
  - He's a pretty good actor, though.

- que:
  - They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.

- que:
  - Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
  ans:
  - He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.

- que:
  - I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
  ans:
  - I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.

- que:
  - We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - This is a gift. From me to you.

- que:
  - You wanna see my politics?
  ans:
  - Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.

- que:
  - How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
  ans:
  - Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.

- que:
  - You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
  ans:
  - Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.

- que:
  - And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
  ans:
  - I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - ... until he found tungsten.

- que:
  - Can the Professor repair his own mind?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.

- que:
  - I don't like him being here.
  ans:
  - So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.

- que:
  - What's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - No. I'm... I don't know if we can do this without Charles.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.

- que:
  - Into the Hudson?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission. Jean, can you raise me up there?
  ans:
  - It's too far.

- que:
  - Jean... can you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough.

- que:
  - Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
  ans:
  - I wanted to talk to you.

- que:
  - Sure you are, sport.
  ans:
  - How long have you been in Alaska?

- que:
  - Anything else I can get you?
  ans:
  - Some cigars. Case of beer.

- que:
  - I won't light the cigars - how about that?
  ans:
  - I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep. Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.

- que:
  - What if I like the pain?
  ans:
  - The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.

- que:
  - By reading my thoughts?
  ans:
  - If necessary.

- que:
  - What if they're naughty?
  ans:
  - You should always work with a spotter.

- que:
  - What do you say?
  ans:
  - Not interested.

- que:
  - Logan, do you see this ring?
  ans:
  - I've seen a lot of rings.

- que:
  - You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words, Are mutants dangerous?
  ans:
  - I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator. The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.

- que:
  - Dr. Grey.
  ans:
  - Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --

- que:
  - Senator?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...

- que:
  - You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
  ans:
  - Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.

- que:
  - What is it you intend to do to me?
  ans:
  - Let's just say, God works too slowly.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Come with me and I'll let her live.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - You're backstage at the encore of creation.

- que:
  - What am I doing here?
  ans:
  - I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.

- que:
  - The point of what?
  ans:
  - What if it never happens? What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - To find Rogue.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.

- que:
  - You designed this yourself?
  ans:
  - Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.

- que:
  - He helped you?
  ans:
  - We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.

- que:
  - They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
  ans:
  - Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.

- que:
  - Why is everybody up at sunrise?
  ans:
  - The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.

- que:
  - What did she do to me?
  ans:
  - I felt like she almost killed me.

- que:
  - And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
  ans:
  - I lost him.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - It was Xavier's people. They knew.

- que:
  - Is that what you're looking for?
  ans:
  - A piece. Only a piece.

- que:
  - Is it enough?
  ans:
  - Enough for a test.

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - Still trying to make the world safe for our kind. Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.

- que:
  - You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
  ans:
  - Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes. Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake... Leave him to me.

- que:
  - The way what is going to be?
  ans:
  - I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row seat.

- que:
  - What do you mean to do?
  ans:
  - This checkmate goes to you. I didn't want to hurt anyone. But you leave me no choice.

- que:
  - WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't really have let you die, you know. I just needed...

- que:
  - And what do you do when you wake up to that?
  ans:
  - I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.

- que:
  - Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting. But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
  ans:
  - Yes, my dear, he is.

- que:
  - And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
  ans:
  - He is the fifth leading authority in his field.

- que:
  - Frederick Frankenstein?
  ans:
  - You have the wrong house.

- que:
  - And who might you be?
  ans:
  - Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

- que:
  - What was your grandfather's name?
  ans:
  - Victor Frankenstein.

- que:
  - Where did you get this cauliflower?
  ans:
  - From your office, sir.

- que:
  - Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.

- que:
  - Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
  ans:
  - Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.

- que:
  - Herr Falkstein! Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
  ans:
  - I did, sir.

- que:
  - Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.

- que:
  - You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
  ans:
  - MMMmmmm.

- que:
  - Still happy you married me?
  ans:
  - MMmmm.

- que:
  - Love me oodles and oodles?
  ans:
  - Well... yes.

- que:
  - Miss me?
  ans:
  - I...

- que:
  - Darling!...you will be careful!?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - You have your tickets?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And your passport?
  ans:
  - Yes, don't worry.

- que:
  - Call me from New York before you leave?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - I promise.

- que:
  - Does that mean you love me?
  ans:
  - You bet your boots it does.

- que:
  - Ready, darling?
  ans:
  - Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.

- que:
  - Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
  ans:
  - What a strange fellow.

- que:
  - Are you suggesting I call him master?
  ans:
  - No, of course not. I just meant...

- que:
  - Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
  ans:
  - You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.

- que:
  - Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
  ans:
  - Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.

- que:
  - Is it worth taking a chance?
  ans:
  - I suppose you're right.

- que:
  - You mean... the laboratory?
  ans:
  - Yes!... the laboratory.

- que:
  - May I have it, please?
  ans:
  - There seem to be quite a few books.

- que:
  - I see. And where is my grandfather's private library?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you mean, sir.

- que:
  - Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
  ans:
  - I think you must be mistaken, sir.

- que:
  - I don't think so. Is my assistant taken care of?
  ans:
  - I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.

- que:
  - What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
  ans:
  - This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.

  - One week at the most!?
  ans:
  - My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.

- que:
  - A piece of what?
  ans:
  - Vermicelli.

- que:
  - But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
  ans:
  - My father was a sick man.

- que:
  - But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
  ans:
  - You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.

- que:
  - How old are you, young man?
  ans:
  - No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.

- que:
  - And do you also say Fro dereck?
  ans:
  - No, Fred ereck.

- que:
  - Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
  ans:
  - It's not. It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.

- que:
  - You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
  ans:

- que:
  - Are these your bags?
  ans:
  - Yes, just the two.

- que:
  - What hump?
  ans:
  - There.

- que:

  - You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
  ans:
  - Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.

- que:
  - Did you see anyone else down here?
  ans:
  - No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.

- que:
  - What is this place?
  ans:
  - Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.

- que:
  - Do you have the name I wrote down?
  ans:
  - Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.

- que:
  - I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
  ans:
  - He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now. I'll prepare the body.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's always been one of my favorite names.

  - All right... elevate me!
  ans:
  - You're sure you know what you're doing?

- que:
  - Who are you talking to?
  ans:
  - To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Someone was playing this in the music room.

- que:
  - Can you play it?
  ans:
  - Maybe...if you get here on time.

  - What monster?
  ans:
  - What d'ya mean \"What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

  - What?
  ans:

- que:
  - I like your style, master. How do we get him here?
  ans:
  - It's the only way.

  - MMMMMmmmmmmm.
  ans:
  - MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?

  ans:
  - MMMmmmmmm.

- que:
  - How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.
  ans:
  - What's that tune that you're playing

- que:
  - It's an honor for me, sir. You play the violin?
  ans:
  - Oh, just a little.

- que:
  - Did you have a pleasant trip?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you. It wasn't bad.

- que:
  - Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure I...get your drift.

- que:
  - That's quite all right. What is it, dear?
  ans:
  - Could I lie down in your bed for a little while? I just can't sleep.

- que:
  - Would you like a sandwich?

  - Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...

  ans:
  - Right here?

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I think I'll...carry him.

- que:
  - Oh! Yes, Doctor.
  ans:
  - Do you think you can sing it?

- que:
  - Did you do it?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
  ans:
  - Not fooling around.

- que:
  - I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
  ans:
  - I see what you mean.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.

- que:
  - Why don't we talk inside?
  ans:
  - MMmmm.

  ans:
  - Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid! I just hope this all ends well.
