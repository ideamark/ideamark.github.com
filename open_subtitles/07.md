- que:
  - who are we talking about?
  ans:
  - your nephew.

- que:
  - anyone else bidding on the rights?
  ans:

  ans:
  - you still can't see it.

- que:
  - you know what's so galling about all this?
  ans:
  - it's all true.

  ans:
  - he's been beaten and tortured all his life.

- que:

  ans:
  - it is easy to be president in a movie.

  ans:
  - that and watch that mexico does not become... another star on the flag of your country.

- que:
  - what pancho villa wants... for himself?

  - all right, got your cameras?

- que:
  - your camera's going to shoot into the sun, huh?
  ans:
  - your lenses are not strong enough.

- que:
  - could you change your attack so that you fire from the west... instead of the east?
  ans:
  - that would give us so much better a picture.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - by day we can win the battle, by night we will win the war.

- que:
  - you never really intended to honor our contract, did you?

  ans:
  - don't speak to me of god.

- que:
  - and the orphans, remember?
  ans:
  - aitken was mad he broke the contract.

- que:
  - you want my two cents, for what they're worth?
  ans:
  - mexico would be a hell of a lot better off... if god had taken his goddamn oil and shoved it under brooklyn.

- que:
  - how will the sons of mexico remember our pancho villa?
  ans:
  - following his assassination, the name of pancho villa... was stricken from all official records, statues, monuments, even children's books.

- que:
  - master?
  ans:
  - when the three suns meet...

- que:
  - master, what's wrong?

  ans:
  - drop him.

- que:
  - you don't know?
  ans:
  - everything in the heavens is here.

- que:

  ans:
  - you tell me.

- que:
  - lords?
  ans:
  - he'll come, make you crawl like the worms you are.

- que:
  - did it see us?
  ans:
  - no, i don't think so.

- que:
  - aren't these the people from your memory?
  ans:
  - when the garthim killed my parents, the podlings adopted me.

- que:
  - what's the shard for?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what was that creature?
  ans:
  - skeksis.

- que:
  - where are we?

  - i saved you from the garthim.
  ans:
  - that prophecy?

- que:
  - why?
  ans:

  ans:
  - the painting belongs to roxy because she cared enough about it to take it with her.

- que:
  - right, margeeve?
  ans:
  - i don't think we should sell it.

- que:
  - why, because it's worth more money than you thought?
  ans:
  - well, that is a consideration.

- que:
  - how do we get around roxy's husband?
  ans:
  - even if he claims one half of roxy's share...

- que:
  - oh, wouldn't that be wonderful?
  ans:
  - just kidding.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we'll have to stake claims for monthly payments.

- que:
  - can you imagine an american lawyer dropping off some papers at night?
  ans:
  - no, i can't.

  - could i just get a steak au poivre and a salade verte?
  ans:
  - well, you leave something, anyway.

- que:
  - has your saint been fasting?
  ans:
  - i don't think it would hurt for you guys to take a look at it.

- que:
  - just boiled eggs, do we think?
  ans:
  - only in france would they serve boiled eggs with such panache.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:

- que:
  - why don't you have something more cuisin?
  ans:

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - hmm, that's a thought.

- que:
  - yes, well, the french are distinctly faddish about wines, aren't they?
  ans:
  - they overlook the most amazing vintages.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - appropriate.

- que:
  - i mean, you're hardly going to tell the seller he has a renoir, are you?
  ans:
  - the price would go out of sight.

- que:
  - and what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think your very fine la tour would... in a competitive bidding, achieve a very fine price.

- que:
  - what kind of price range are we talking?
  ans:
  - perhaps a million pounds.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - a million, dad.

- que:
  - tou mean, personality wise?
  ans:
  - no, i think i mean character wise.

- que:
  - where do these pretty things come from?
  ans:
  - usually we beg in front of dior or st. laurent... so that rich women on shopping sprees can expiate their sins.

- que:
  - why don't you just put that in the miscellaneous file for now?
  ans:
  - i don't think we need it in tulsa.

- que:
  - what can i do?
  ans:
  - this conference was fixed up long ago.

- que:
  - more to the point... would they want to meet me?
  ans:
  - i'm hardly the desirable young suitor they might have in mind.

- que:
  - don't you wanna see me?
  ans:
  - naturally.

- que:
  - do you really think it's the best idea for you?
  ans:
  - one hardly has a choice, roxeanne.

- que:
  - how was the trip?
  ans:
  - it's a privilege for us to be welcomed here... in your country, in your family, in your beautiful home.

  - roxeanne and isabel?
  ans:
  - we think of the french as practical, rational.

- que:

  ans:
  - no.

  ans:
  - the deer.

- que:
  - what happens after that?
  ans:

- que:
  - do you know roy taylor?
  ans:
  - met him.

- que:
  - you can't find evie?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how about this, huh?
  ans:
  - dj mount rejects eve because of her questionable past.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yeah, i don't really think much about that kind of stuff.

- que:
  - look up from your microscope, huh?
  ans:
  - these are real people we're trying to figure out here.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - real question is, where does she go next?
  ans:
  - you're on fire, man.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna turn you into an investigator yet.

- que:
  - and that's based on...?
  ans:
  - money and meth.

- que:
  - only question is, why wasn't he facing her?
  ans:
  - it got thigh back there.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - that just... makes me a little sick.

- que:
  - you pick dead bodies out of mass graves, and yanking out a belly button ring makes you sick?
  ans:
  - okay, okay, moving on.

- que:
  - why the hell you pick me up, man?
  ans:
  - i think you know why i brought you in.

- que:
  - metro cop?
  ans:
  - i'm special agent ronald oakes.

- que:
  - one of us?
  ans:
  - my orders were not to break deep cover for anybody.

- que:
  - got any keys for these cuffs?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - you ran him, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - came back clean?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - what about this murder?
  ans:
  - the night that dj mount disappeared, hall got ripped of for a mountain of meth and a ton of cash.

- que:
  - dj mount ripped of all?
  ans:
  - nah, doesn't scan.

- que:
  - so listen, anybody asks... why'd you have me arrested?
  ans:
  - weapons beef.

- que:
  - why do you think they never got me on anything?
  ans:
  - because terence baskin is my past.

- que:
  - where did you find her?
  ans:
  - museum.

- que:
  - lead to murder?
  ans:
  - sure, they were both capable.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - rulz built himself a studio around that time.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - oh, i think, uh, i think we need to find a way to find a body buried under a slab of cement.

- que:
  - well, can't you get a warrant?
  ans:
  - to look around the premises, maybe, but no way to tear it up.

- que:
  - what, i'm gonna hurt her... his feelings?
  ans:
  - tutti is the best cadaver dog in the world, agent booth.

- que:
  - i mean, so what?
  ans:
  - he drools a little.

- que:
  - what's up with that?
  ans:
  - you know, your eyes are kind of close together, but i don't comment.

- que:
  - is he sincere?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - where did booth go?
  ans:
  - i got to give him the news.

- que:
  - we've already got cause of death and identity what am i looking for?
  ans:
  - it might be grasping but that odd mark we found on mount's skull, see if you can find anything like it on eve's remains.

- que:
  - jamaica?
  ans:
  - god, that's incredible.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - you have keys to each other's places.

- que:
  - living together?
  ans:
  - silly.

- que:
  - uh, cause of death?
  ans:
  - same as mount.

- que:
  - zygo zu...?
  ans:
  - you said she was killed by crystal meth.

- que:
  - rulz couldn't have smashed her into a wall?
  ans:
  - her radius was separated from the scaphoid and trapezium.

- que:
  - this is a weird kind of interrogation, huh?
  ans:
  - cops telling me what i didn't do.

- que:
  - what you think, i'm some type of idiot?
  ans:
  - well, do me a favor, deny it.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because every time some raper gets murdered, his business goes straight through the roof.

- que:
  - why should dj mount get the bump, huh?
  ans:
  - maybe it's my turn.

- que:
  - for how long?
  ans:
  - sweeten the pot, i'll charge you with mount's death, too.

- que:
  - what have you got?
  ans:
  - look, i can tell y'all.

- que:
  - we have to figure it out just from motive?
  ans:
  - okay, look, bones, this is, you know, sort of my thing.

- que:
  - where did you find her?
  ans:
  - the museum.

- que:
  - you're saying that dj mount was going to leave bassment records?
  ans:
  - all he needed was the money to buy himself back.

- que:
  - but what about eve?
  ans:
  - eve couldn't kill nobody.

- que:
  - hey, how about this?
  ans:
  - hall's got motive to kill mount.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because he's jumping labels and he's running away with some girl who's stealing mount's meth and money.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - i mean, it feels real to me... i mean, eve is a woman in love, whs trying to escape a world that's just crushing her.

- que:
  - what the hell is that?
  ans:
  - not sure.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i'm going to spread the pain.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - that's my new motto.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - killed mount in that wall so that he wouldn't leave your label.

- que:
  - did he just poke me with his little stick?
  ans:
  - this is my place.

- que:
  - hey, booth?
  ans:
  - don't break the cane.

- que:
  - arrest him for what?
  ans:
  - he's the guy who pointed a gun at a federal agent.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - well, she said something came up at work, but i know the truth.

- que:
  - how many times do you want me to poke zack?
  ans:
  - just once, but as hard as you can.

- que:
  - why don't i hit him as haras i can?
  ans:
  - because you have arms like noodles, while i am vigorous and burly.

- que:
  - that all you got, burly boy?
  ans:
  - they got freaked out by stage six.

- que:
  - let them confirm the match.
  ans:
  - what... what is stage six?

- que:
  - what, and let them have all the glory?
  ans:
  - my chest hurts.

- que:
  - getting yourself in the mood?
  ans:
  - trying.

- que:
  - oh?
  ans:
  - tessa's not going.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - sure, nothing wrong with being alone.

- que:
  - no, i mean, you like to go on vacation?
  ans:
  - yeah, i go places all the time.

- que:
  - got away from what?
  ans:
  - i think about not coming back.

- que:
  - seriously?
  ans:
  - yeah, you know, you go with someone, you joke about not going back to your real life..

- que:
  - who just threw that?
  ans:
  - oh shit, mr. duncan.

- que:
  - you know this dude?
  ans:
  - i ran into an old student, i got held up.

- que:
  - mm hmm, did you get the present?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, voil.

- que:
  - you made me laugh.
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - he's an herbivore.

- que:
  - good birthday?
  ans:

- que:
  - what was your favorite present?
  ans:
  - my jacket...

- que:
  - what's on your agenda tomorrow?
  ans:

  ans:
  - so, we'd move.

  ans:

  ans:

  ans:

- que:
  - jessie?
  ans:
  - you have four new messages.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - it's richard, richard wells.

- que:
  - richard?
  ans:
  - your wife was an undergraduate student of mine.

- que:
  - actually, do you have a minute?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i know this is a terrible time.

- que:
  - help us?
  ans:
  - i'm a doctor.

- que:
  - what is it you do, paul?
  ans:
  - i teach biology.

- que:
  - can you tell us what this is about?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - this would be the identical boy down to the last chromosome on the last hair of his head.
  ans:
  - do you mean cloned?

- que:
  - this is how you wanna help us?
  ans:
  - i used to be affiliated with a hospital here and i had a chance to review jessie's records.

- que:
  - paul, please.
  ans:
  - you did what?

- que:
  - you come at me with this?
  ans:
  - god knows what hell you've been through.

- que:
  - you've successfully cloned a human being?
  ans:
  - no, i haven't but only because i've been looking for an ideal candidate.

- que:
  - what are you proposing here?
  ans:
  - he's not even sure that he can...

- que:
  - any idea how much could go wrong?
  ans:
  - honey, i... listen, i love you, i love you.

- que:
  - i love you beyond words, okay?
  ans:
  - but only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right.

- que:
  - but what if it did?
  ans:
  - it still wouldn't be adam.

- que:
  - you know what i kept thinking while i was waiting for paramedics... and he was in my arms... and i was watching him die?
  ans:
  - yeah, i will.

- que:
  - sure i've heard of him.
  ans:
  - hey, sam, can i... can i ask you something?

- que:
  - why do you ask?
  ans:
  - he was an old teacher of jessie's.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - no, i think we should call it adam.

- que:
  - she has to lie down for at least an hour, so why don't we go look at the house and i'll show you around?
  ans:
  - she's in good hands.

- que:
  - so, all these people and no one else knows?
  ans:
  - the procedure doesn't differ much from a standard implant.

- que:
  - dr. wells?
  ans:
  - thanks, george.

- que:
  - so why don't you follow me?
  ans:
  - i'll show you around.

- que:
  - what if the implant doesn't take, the procedure's a bust... what then?
  ans:
  - it'll work, paul.

- que:
  - but if i can speak plainly, what more do you have to lose?
  ans:
  - her.

- que:
  - is this for real?
  ans:
  - for now.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - oh my god, paul.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - i'm back.

- que:
  - oh, baby, thank god.
  ans:
  - what's wrong?

- que:
  - this is the same as last time, remember?
  ans:
  - it's him.

- que:
  - you wanted to give us a scare, didn't you?
  ans:
  - it's good... nice kids, bright too.

- que:
  - you don't still miss your old school?
  ans:
  - no, it's more like i miss missing it.

- que:
  - keep it away from the trees.
  ans:
  - uncle richard, want to help me fly it?

- que:
  - but i thought god made everything.
  ans:
  - so what was this word you said?

- que:
  - how many times i gotta tell you, you can't leave your toys around?
  ans:
  - somebody's gonna trip and...

- que:
  - where did you get this?
  ans:
  - it was a birthday present from joey smoyer.

- que:
  - why don't you get some sleep?
  ans:
  - dad, i've been thinking...

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - i don't think i like you so much anymore.

- que:
  - where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - but he's still his own person entirely.

- que:
  - i honestly forget sometimes, you know?
  ans:
  - and then something like that... that toy dinosaur thing will happen.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - if he ever found out.

- que:
  - what if he did?
  ans:
  - i don't know, he just collapsed.

- que:
  - night terrors?
  ans:
  - it's a sleep disorder.

- que:
  - what's happening here, richard?
  ans:
  - that's what i'd like to find out.

- que:
  - let's just give it a little time, okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - but no, no, no... is he all right?
  ans:
  - he's fine.

- que:
  - come on, come on.
  ans:
  - you okay?

- que:
  - adam?
  ans:
  - i'm talking to you.

- que:
  - adam?
  ans:
  - hey, i'm talking to you.

- que:
  - did you hear me calling you?
  ans:
  - your dinner is ready.

- que:
  - i don't think it's anything to worry about, okay?
  ans:
  - all right, take care and i'll see you soon.

- que:
  - you sure you're okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - anybody know what this is?
  ans:
  - it's a big ugly visual aide.

- que:
  - so what, the gene isn't present?
  ans:
  - no, no, it's present, it's just inactive.

- que:
  - why don't you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then, you know, go?
  ans:
  - i'm going to put on a little show for you guys and you're going to pay me your lunch money.

- que:
  - how about this?
  ans:
  - you're a tiny little boy.

- que:
  - if there's anything he isn't, it's common.
  ans:
  - what if his having outlived the life of that first original cell has somehow allowed some dormant problem to be switched on?

- que:
  - you don't think i'm just as concerned?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - ever want to have any children of your own, richard?
  ans:
  - jessie's always saying how great you are with adam.

- que:
  - where did you learn that language?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - yeah, i would, actually.

- que:
  - dr. lieber?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - in beauford?
  ans:
  - great.

- que:
  - who's that?
  ans:
  - adam, open the door.

- que:

  ans:
  - look, it's fine.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i saw it.

- que:
  - what did you see?
  ans:
  - adam, talk to me.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - something bad is going to happen.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - say it.

- que:
  - so, how many eggs did you retrieve?
  ans:
  - i only retrieved three.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - you look...

- que:
  - oh, what's that for?
  ans:
  - nasty monkey.

- que:
  - so what you're saying, these nightmares might have started at this age anyway?
  ans:
  - or possibly triggered by any number of things... school, stress, tension at home.

- que:
  - retained memories of his first life?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - he's never felt as comfortable here as you, has he?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you don't think he'd ever try to leave, do you?
  ans:
  - jessie, that can't happen.

- que:
  - i can trust you to rein paul in?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - apparently, they couldn't reach you?
  ans:
  - i was out.

- que:
  - how's adam?
  ans:
  - he's fine, mrs. duncan.

- que:
  - is that wine on your breath?
  ans:
  - i was having lunch.

- que:
  - god, paul.
  ans:
  - with who?

- que:
  - wait, where are we going?
  ans:
  - to get a second opinion.

- que:
  - about these night terrors... you're confident that's what this is?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - honey, who is zachary?
  ans:
  - he's the boy who lives in my dreams.

- que:
  - this boy told you his name was zachary?
  ans:
  - not really, i kind of just know.

- que:
  - and you've never seen his face?
  ans:
  - he doesn't like to show it, but i know because of his jacket.

- que:
  - what kind of jacket?
  ans:
  - zachary.

- que:
  - and where are you?
  ans:
  - where we live.

- que:
  - richard?
  ans:
  - listen, there's something he's not telling us, jessie, i know it.

- que:
  - zachary, zachary, where are you?
  ans:
  - tell me about zachary.

- que:
  - what are you trying to tell us, adam?
  ans:
  - say it.

- que:
  - if you don't understand it, how do you expect to beat it?
  ans:
  - he's okay.

- que:
  - dad... did i die?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - in the city?
  ans:
  - jesus, it's possible.

- que:
  - how can you say that?
  ans:
  - because he can't.

- que:
  - okay now, i want outside your houses in the pictures, okay?
  ans:
  - take your time.

- que:
  - what would that entail?
  ans:

  - there have been times i've seen you talking to him and he's in that same blank state, but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?
  ans:
  - don't push me, richard.

- que:
  - you understand i'll go public?
  ans:
  - i'm not kidding.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - i told you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it doesn't mean...

- que:
  - you're not?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure of anything right now.

- que:
  - you wish we'd never done this?
  ans:
  - good night, baby.

- que:
  - are you sure this is the only saint pius?
  ans:
  - well, it's the only one in this city.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - a few weeks?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - melinda.

- que:
  - great, thank you.
  ans:
  - so, it was just vacant?

- que:
  - cora williams?
  ans:
  - there had been incidents at school.

- que:
  - zachary didn't say a word about what i'd done.
  ans:
  - the fire at saint pius?

- que:
  - that's where they found his body.
  ans:
  - are you here?

- que:
  - where was his father?
  ans:
  - oh, he was at the hospital like always.

- que:
  - you shouldn't have touched that box.
  ans:
  - the hospital, he was a doctor?

- que:
  - is this me?
  ans:
  - honey, don't be scared.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - adam can't come out to play right now, mrs. duncan.

- que:
  - you couldn't use him, could you?
  ans:
  - zachary.

- que:
  - but the fire destroyed him, right?
  ans:
  - you didn't even have a viable cell.

- que:
  - i'm right, aren't i?
  ans:
  - except for one thing.

- que:
  - to my family?
  ans:
  - i'd think you of all people would understand, seeing as we were both after the same thing.

- que:
  - what you did goes way beyond...
  ans:
  - is there, paul?

- que:
  - societal standards?
  ans:
  - you name me a single medical advancement that didn't.

- que:
  - if i'm not supposed to do this, paul, then how is it that i can?
  ans:
  - because you're a scientist.

- que:
  - have you trespassed?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - no, this is over, you understand?
  ans:
  - we're gonna go to the police, and then we're gonna find someplace, anyplace that can help him.

- que:
  - terminate?
  ans:
  - let go.

- que:
  - who are you right now?
  ans:
  - i'm your son.

- que:
  - how are you doing?
  ans:
  - it's not finished yet.

- que:
  - but those doctors you've been working with, they all say this change could be really good for you, right?
  ans:
  - sweetie, you've been doing so great.

- que:
  - hey, kiddo, i thought you were...
  ans:
  - yeah?

- que:
  - i thought you were coming down.
  ans:
  - adam?

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - you'd tell me if there was anything...

- que:
  - who just threw that?
  ans:
  - give me that cake.

- que:
  - maurice?
  ans:
  - oh shit, mr. duncan.

- que:
  - you know this dude?
  ans:
  - i had maurice in my ninth grade bio class about five years ago.

- que:
  - paul, what took you so long?
  ans:
  - i ran into an old student, i got held up.

- que:
  - mm hmm, did you get the present?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, voila.

- que:
  - you made me laugh.
  ans:
  - ready?

- que:
  - so dorset prep, where is that exactly?
  ans:
  - yeah i know, i'm breaking every rule.

- que:
  - hello, is steggie in here?
  ans:
  - beware.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - he's an herbivore.

- que:
  - good birthday?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what was your favorite present?
  ans:
  - my jacket...

- que:
  - what's on your agenda tomorrow?
  ans:
  - uh, i have to stop by the gallery.

- que:
  - you do realize it'd mean moving, right?
  ans:
  - so, we'd move.

- que:
  - a ding dong...
  ans:
  - yeah?

- que:
  - a ding dong...
  ans:
  - like you?

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - kaboom!
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you want this?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and how would you like to pay for this?
  ans:
  - a credit card, please.

- que:
  - ma'am?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i got stuck at a teacher's conference.

- que:
  - jessie?
  ans:
  - you have four new messages.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - it's richard, richard wells.

- que:
  - richard?
  ans:
  - your wife was an undergraduate student of mine.

- que:
  - actually, do you have a minute?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i know this is a terrible time.

- que:
  - help us?
  ans:
  - i'm a doctor.

- que:
  - what is it you do, paul?
  ans:
  - i teach biology.

- que:
  - can you tell us what this is about?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you mean cloned?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - this is how you wanna help us?
  ans:
  - i used to be affiliated with a hospital here and i had a chance to review jessie's records.

- que:
  - you did what?
  ans:
  - i'm aware of the complications surrounding adam's delivery, that it's impossible for you to conceive again.

- que:
  - you looked at her records?
  ans:
  - i had to be certain that jessie's condition didn't preclude carrying a child and it doesn't, so yes, i can help you.

- que:
  - you come at me with this?
  ans:
  - god knows what hell you've been through.

- que:
  - you've successfully cloned a human being?
  ans:
  - no, i haven't but only because i've been looking for an ideal candidate.

- que:
  - what are you proposing here?
  ans:
  - he's not even sure that he can...

- que:
  - any idea how much could go wrong?
  ans:
  - honey, i... listen, i love you, i love you.

- que:
  - i love you beyond words, okay?
  ans:
  - but only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right.

- que:
  - but what if it did?
  ans:
  - it still wouldn't be adam.

- que:
  - you know what i kept thinking while i was waiting for paramedics... and he was in my arms... and i was watching him die?
  ans:
  - this is the last time i'll ever get to hold him.

- que:
  - um... so... how's jessie taking all this?
  ans:
  - actually, she's... she's not so well.

- que:
  - look, would you please just pass on my condolences to her?
  ans:
  - yeah, i will.

- que:
  - have you ever heard of a doctor named richard wells?
  ans:
  - richard wells.

- que:
  - why do you ask?
  ans:
  - he was an old teacher of jessie's.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - three, two, one.

- que:
  - do you think that's a good idea?
  ans:
  - no, i think we should call it adam.

- que:
  - guess who?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are we all in?
  ans:
  - damn, what a handsome group.

- que:
  - she has to lie down for at least an hour, so why don't we go look at the house and i'll show you around?
  ans:
  - she's in good hands.

- que:
  - so, all these people and no one else knows?
  ans:
  - the procedure doesn't differ much from a standard implant.

- que:
  - dr. wells?
  ans:
  - thanks, george.

- que:
  - so why don't you follow me?
  ans:
  - i'll show you around.

- que:
  - beautiful country, isn't it?
  ans:
  - this whole area has a lot of history.

- que:
  - what if the implant doesn't take, the procedure's a bust... what then?
  ans:
  - it'll work, paul.

- que:
  - but if i can speak plainly, what more do you have to lose?
  ans:
  - her.

- que:
  - is this for real?
  ans:
  - for now.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - oh my god, paul.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - i'm back.

- que:
  - okay, how long?
  ans:
  - 30 seconds, 31, 32... 33, 34, 35...

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - 40 seconds, 41...

- que:
  - this is the same as last time, remember?
  ans:
  - it's him.

- que:
  - you wanted to give us a scare, didn't you?
  ans:
  - it's good... nice kids, bright too.

- que:
  - you don't still miss your old school?
  ans:
  - no, it's more like i miss missing it.

- que:
  - uncle richard, want to help me fly it?
  ans:
  - let's get it up there.

- que:
  - so what was this word you said?
  ans:
  - reeservoier.

- que:
  - well, in a way he did, if you believe he created those people who figured out how to make a reservoir, right?
  ans:
  - somebody's gonna trip and...

- que:
  - where did you get this?
  ans:
  - it was a birthday present from joey smoyer.

- que:
  - do you like it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why don't you get some sleep?
  ans:
  - dad, i've been thinking...

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - i don't think i like you so much anymore.

- que:
  - where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - but he's still his own person entirely.

- que:
  - i honestly forget sometimes, you know?
  ans:
  - and then something like that... that toy dinosaur thing will happen.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - if he ever found out.

- que:
  - what if he did?
  ans:
  - about what it would mean to him.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i don't know, he just collapsed.

- que:
  - night terrors?
  ans:
  - it's a sleep disorder.

- que:
  - what's happening here, richard?
  ans:
  - that's what i'd like to find out.

- que:
  - let's just give it a little time, okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - but no, no, no... is he all right?
  ans:
  - he's fine.

- que:
  - come on, come on.
  ans:
  - you okay?

- que:
  - adam?
  ans:
  - there you are.

- que:
  - hey... are you all right?
  ans:
  - i'm talking to you.

- que:
  - adam?
  ans:
  - hey, i'm talking to you.

- que:
  - did you hear me calling you?
  ans:
  - your dinner is ready.

- que:
  - i don't think it's anything to worry about, okay?
  ans:
  - all right, take care and i'll see you soon.

- que:
  - you sure you're okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - anybody know what this is?
  ans:
  - it's a big ugly visual aide.

- que:
  - so what, the gene isn't present?
  ans:
  - no, no, it's present, it's just inactive.

- que:
  - why don't you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then, you know, go?
  ans:
  - i'm going to put on a little show for you guys and you're going to pay me your lunch money.

- que:
  - how about this?
  ans:
  - you're a tiny little boy.

- que:
  - if there's anything he isn't, it's common.
  ans:
  - what if his having outlived the life of that first original cell has somehow allowed some dormant problem to be switched on?

- que:
  - you don't think i'm just as concerned?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - ever want to have any children of your own, richard?
  ans:
  - jessie's always saying how great you are with adam.

- que:
  - where did you learn that language?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - how many times do i got to tell you...

- que:
  - you okay, honey?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - yeah, i would, actually.

- que:
  - dr. lieber?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - in beauford?
  ans:
  - great.

- que:
  - who's that?
  ans:
  - open the door.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - how... the curtain.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the curtain.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - look, it's fine.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i saw it.

- que:
  - what did you see?
  ans:
  - adam, talk to me.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - something bad is going to happen.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - say it.

- que:
  - so, how many eggs did you retrieve?
  ans:
  - i only retrieved three.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - you look...

- que:
  - hey, hey, how would you like that?
  ans:
  - i just got an idea.

- que:
  - come on, you chicken.
  ans:
  - how about we have a swinging contest?

- que:
  - oh, what's that for?
  ans:
  - nasty monkey.

- que:
  - so what you're saying, these nightmares might have started at this age anyway?
  ans:
  - or possibly triggered by any number of things... school, stress, tension at home.

- que:
  - retained memories of his first life?
  ans:
  - there's an often cited experiment... a rat was trained to run a maze, killed, then ground up and fed to a second rat.

- que:
  - so, it's not possible he's remembering?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - he's never felt as comfortable here as you, has he?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you don't think he'd ever try to leave, do you?
  ans:
  - jessie, that can't happen.

- que:
  - i can trust you to rein paul in?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - apparently, they couldn't reach you?
  ans:
  - i was out.

- que:
  - how's adam?
  ans:
  - he's fine, mrs. duncan.

- que:
  - is that wine on your breath?
  ans:
  - i was having lunch.

- que:
  - why are you so upset?
  ans:
  - it was just lunch.

- que:
  - wait, where are we going?
  ans:
  - to get a second opinion.

- que:
  - about these night terrors... you're confident that's what this is?
  ans:
  - i see it in a number of kids adam's age.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - honey, who is zachary?
  ans:
  - he's the boy who lives in my dreams.

- que:
  - this boy told you his name was zachary?
  ans:
  - not really, i kind of just know.

- que:
  - and you've never seen his face?
  ans:
  - he doesn't like to show it, but i know because of his jacket.

- que:
  - what kind of jacket?
  ans:
  - just let him answer.

- que:
  - adam?
  ans:
  - zachary.

- que:
  - and where are you?
  ans:
  - where we live.

- que:
  - richard?
  ans:
  - listen, there's something he's not telling us, jessie, i know it.

- que:
  - zachary, zachary, where are you?
  ans:
  - tell me about zachary.

- que:
  - what are you trying to tell us, adam?
  ans:
  - say it.

- que:
  - if you don't understand it, how do you expect to beat it?
  ans:
  - he's okay.

- que:
  - dad... did i die?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - in the city?
  ans:
  - jesus, it's possible.

- que:
  - how can you say that?
  ans:
  - because he can't.

- que:
  - okay now, i want to see everyone in your family outside your houses in the pictures, okay?
  ans:
  - take your time.

- que:
  - what would that entail?
  ans:
  - well, for starters, i'd like you to bring him in again.

- que:
  - i'll talk to him, okay?
  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - are you hungry?
  ans:
  - hi, mom.

- que:
  - can you tell me the name of the school?
  ans:
  - pius...

- que:

  ans:
  - it's a mild tranquilizer.

- que:
  - right paul?
  ans:

  ans:
  - answer me, richard.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - paul, you've gone completely...

- que:
  - there have been times i've seen you talking to him and he's in that same blank state, but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?
  ans:

- que:
  - zachary didn't say a word about what i'd done.
  ans:
  - adam?

- que:
  - are you here?
  ans:
  - i was at home the next day, when i was struck by the most awful premonition.

- que:
  - adam?
  ans:
  - so she went down the stairs to the basement, to check on the water heater.

- que:
  - are you down there?
  ans:
  - and that's where he was... just waiting for her.

- que:
  - where was his father?
  ans:
  - oh, he was at the hospital like always.

- que:

  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - at first i couldn't make it out, but then it became clear that it was incredibly huge.

  ans:

- que:
  - what action are you going to take in view of prof. messenger's opinion?

- que:
  - all right, what about it?
  ans:

  - forget what?
  ans:
  - that we're not on earth.

- que:
  - guibariane wanted to be in the earth, with the worms.
  ans:
  - why don't we have our talk tonight?

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - and you, how do i know who you are?
  ans:
  - shhh...

- que:
  - who's this?
  ans:
  - chris, this is me...

- que:

  ans:
  - i don't know...

- que:
  - you can't what?
  ans:
  - i feel like i've got to be with you... all the time, to see you...

  ans:
  - i've work to do, hari.

- que:
  - as who?
  ans:
  - as doctor snout.

- que:
  - why do you keep staring at me?
  ans:
  - you might at least knock.

- que:
  - so you've had visitors?
  ans:
  - you handle that very cleanly.

- que:
  - narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?
  ans:
  - lf you came here to clown, you might as well leave.

- que:
  - try to launch it from the corridor.
  ans:
  - you're not going to tell me you haven't tried the rope or hammer?

- que:
  - why didn't you warn me?
  ans:
  - you wouldn't have believed me.

- que:
  - what if she were the contact we've been waiting for, for so long?
  ans:
  - the night is a blessed time here.

- que:
  - chris, where are you?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - what are you doing right now?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - ls it epilepsy?
  ans:
  - this is my wife.

- que:
  - how do you do?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - are these yours?
  ans:
  - no, they're snout's.

- que:
  - why should l?
  ans:
  - you'll see things a lot clearer.

- que:
  - i used acid to burn the blood, but it regenerates itself.
  ans:
  - what do you think, snout?

- que:
  - there's no need of absorbent cotton.
  ans:
  - self regeneration?

- que:
  - are you qualified to perform an autopsy?
  ans:
  - she's my wife.

- que:
  - don't you understand?
  ans:
  - it's more humane to experiment on them than on the earth rabbits.

- que:
  - it may feel pleasant, but...
  ans:
  - did you feel pain when you broke through the door?

- que:
  - are you envious?
  ans:
  - perhaps.

- que:
  - toward whom are you guilty?
  ans:
  - toward you, among others.

- que:
  - who am l?
  ans:
  - as soon as i close my eyes i can't recall what my face is like.

  - do you know who you are?
  ans:
  - yes, all humans do.

- que:
  - what happened after that?
  ans:
  - after that, i went away.

- que:
  - where did you go?
  ans:
  - to another city.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i was transferred.

- que:
  - why didn't you take me with you?
  ans:
  - because you refused to come.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - the rate of regeneration has slowed.

- que:
  - and you've come in the middle of the night to tell me that?
  ans:
  - i'll tell you exactly why i came.

- que:
  - yes, but how?
  ans:
  - by x rays.

- que:
  - again your idiotic x ray theories about the greatness of science?
  ans:
  - we'll modulate the beam with the brain waves of one of us.

- que:
  - give everything back to that... mass ofjelly?
  ans:
  - it's already invaded my soul.

- que:
  - blackmail?
  ans:
  - i convinced him that we should start with the encephalogram.

- que:
  - you're trying to patch it up?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - so she knows how to sleep already?
  ans:
  - this is going to end badly.

- que:
  - what do you propose then?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - to the library tomorrow?
  ans:
  - we'll set up the table.

- que:
  - suppose that she follows us?
  ans:
  - try leaving the door unlocked this time.

- que:
  - what door?
  ans:
  - it's just a mirage.

- que:
  - why aren't you sleeping?
  ans:
  - you don't love me.

- que:
  - about what?
  ans:
  - i don't know where i came from.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i don't understand anything.

- que:
  - who've you been talking to?
  ans:
  - sartorius told me.

- que:
  - last night?
  ans:
  - sometimes, yes, not always.

- que:
  - the girl, the other one, what happened to her?
  ans:
  - we'd quarreled.

- que:
  - why do you think she did that?
  ans:
  - i believe she felt that i didn't love her anymore.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - perhaps he's having guests.

- que:
  - that's great.
  ans:
  - what is that you're reading?

- que:
  - now perhaps you'll let me inject a few words of my own?
  ans:
  - i propose a toast to snout, to his courage, and his devotion to duty.

- que:
  - who do you think you are to judge us?
  ans:
  - at least i know why i'm here.

- que:
  - your time is spent lolling in bed day after day.
  ans:
  - lf you will permit me to inquire, what exactly are you doing on solaris?

- que:
  - ls that how you understand your duty?
  ans:
  - you're not even a human being.

- que:
  - i hope i'm not bothering you?
  ans:
  - you're really a good fellow.

- que:
  - could you help me?
  ans:
  - certainly he has, absolutely.

- que:
  - tell me, do you believe in our mission?
  ans:
  - i'll stay up a while yet.

- que:
  - maybe we should whip him with birch leaves?
  ans:
  - or we could even pray to it...

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - i think i closed the door...

- que:
  - ls anything wrong?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - wait until she comes back.

- que:
  - leave the station?
  ans:
  - chris, she can live only here, on the station.

- que:
  - what else can i do?
  ans:
  - i love her.

- que:
  - or the girl on the rocket?
  ans:
  - she will return.

- que:
  - ls it me?
  ans:
  - what?..

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you may have looked like her.

- que:
  - do i disgust you?
  ans:
  - nothing...

- que:
  - what is not indispensable to life is in some way harmful to it?
  ans:
  - he's feverish.

- que:
  - how did guibariane really die?
  ans:
  - you haven't told me.

- que:
  - how was your trip?
  ans:
  - it was just a bit tiring.

- que:
  - are you happy?
  ans:
  - happiness is an idea that's obsolete.

- que:
  - what have you been waiting for?
  ans:
  - you might have telephoned.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - wait, i'll be right back.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - there is no more hari.

- que:
  - snout, why are we being tortured like this?
  ans:
  - we have lost our sense of the cosmic.

- que:
  - you remember the myth of sisyphus?
  ans:
  - since we sent your encephalogram, not a single one of the visitors has returned.

- que:
  - just like that? ln one stroke?
  ans:
  - at least we can hope now.

- que:
  - how old are you?
  ans:
  - fifty two.

- que:
  - have you been here long?
  ans:
  - you must have read my background papers.

- que:
  - i suppose next you'll want to know what life's all about, eh?
  ans:
  - please, let's not be ironical.

- que:
  - to return to earth?
  ans:
  - little by little, everything will come to normal.

- que:
  - just for the hope of her return?
  ans:
  - but i have no hope.

- que:
  - wait for what?
  ans:
  - i don't know...

- que:
  - are you all right now?
  ans:
  - yes, i feel fine.

- que:
  - chris, what is it?
  ans:
  - i love you so much.

- que:
  - don't you love me any more?
  ans:
  - i've made progress, and i recognise that.

- que:
  - don't you think so?
  ans:
  - linda, this is chris kelvin.

- que:
  - can i help you?
  ans:
  - we're looking for dr chris kelvin.

- que:
  - why not send in the security force?
  ans:
  - we did.

- que:
  - is that what everybody wants?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - kelvin, is it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - well, you wanna come in?
  ans:

  ans:
  - dr gordon.

- que:
  - can you tell me what's happening here?
  ans:
  - i could tell you what's happening, but i don't know if that'd really tell you what's happening.

- que:
  - didn't you talk to snow?
  ans:
  - i wanted to hear your version.

- que:
  - who are you representing?
  ans:
  - i'm the last effort to recover this mission, before they abandon this ship and everyone on board.

- que:
  - who else is here?
  ans:
  - i saw a boy.

- que:
  - how is that possible?
  ans:
  - i think that's why you're here.

- que:
  - how much sleep?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how long can you go without sleep?
  ans:
  - depends.

- que:
  - did you run any tests on the food, air, water?
  ans:
  - i checked it 50 times.

- que:
  - how are you doing?
  ans:
  - depression.

- que:
  - now, what can you tell me about what's happening here?
  ans:
  - just that i want it to stop, but i want to stop it.

- que:
  - gordon happens to be gordon, you know?
  ans:
  - but i'll see what i can do.

- que:
  - how's the spawn?
  ans:
  - oh, good.

  ans:
  - don't blow it.

  ans:
  - not always.

  - do you remember where we first saw each other?
  ans:
  - on a train.

- que:

  ans:

  - cos i need help.

- que:
  - aren't we all?
  ans:
  - rheya, given all the elements of the known universe and enough time, our existence is inevitable.

  ans:
  - i mean...

- que:
  - what do you think's happening?
  ans:
  - you need rest.

- que:
  - are you gonna be all right here?
  ans:

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i can't be here.

- que:

  ans:
  - you should have told me.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - chris, i had to.

- que:
  - what's changed?
  ans:
  - i didn't even know you wanted one.

- que:

  ans:
  - no, chris.

- que:
  - she's nice, right?
  ans:

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i'll have to think about that.

- que:
  - are they or are they not made of subatomic particles?
  ans:
  - subatomic particles.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think probably.

- que:
  - stabilised by what?
  ans:
  - guess.

- que:
  - so if we created a negative higgs field and bombarded them with higgs antibosons they might disintegrate?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - this is just a theory, you know?
  ans:
  - we could be wrong.

- que:
  - don't you see that as a problem?
  ans:
  - i think it's a serious mistake to assume it's benign.

- que:
  - is that really why you think they're here?
  ans:
  - given its resources it could have done anything, including destroy us.

- que:
  - shall we pick up the other one on the way?
  ans:
  - shouldn't be too hard.

- que:
  - chris, what's she talking about?
  ans:
  - nothing.

  - she's a copy.

- que:
  - who am i, then?
  ans:
  - a puppet.

  - why did you kill yourself?
  ans:
  - it seemed like a good idea at the time.

- que:
  - what about your son?
  ans:
  - that's not my son.

- que:
  - why do you think it has to want something?
  ans:
  - this is why you have to leave.

- que:
  - do you understand what i'm trying to tell you?
  ans:
  - there are no answers.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - she drank liquid oxygen.

  - by the way, the higgs device also drained the fuel cell reactors.
  ans:
  - why would you say that?

- que:
  - can i make a suggestion?
  ans:
  - i mean, this is...

- que:
  - did it matter?
  ans:
  - pretty soon, jerry.

- que:
  - what do you say, congressman?
  ans:
  - poontang.

- que:

  ans:
  - local hero around here.

- que:
  - why is that?

  - and that made her a hero?
  ans:
  - well, notorious, anyway.

  ans:
  - the one with the dynamite on its back.

- que:
  - she blew up a cat?
  ans:
  - he was scheduled to die.

- que:

  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - well, i came to deliver your fiance.

  ans:
  - other than before.

- que:
  - felony melanie?
  ans:
  - she was never convicted.

- que:
  - you're supposed to be a democrat, remember?
  ans:
  - there is nothing wrong with being poor.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - she was ashamed of her background.

- que:
  - who hasn't been embarrassed by their parents at one point?
  ans:
  - i'm going to assume that was a rhetorical question.

- que:
  - and how, exactly, does little miss alabama plan to accommodate 500 people?
  ans:
  - i suppose she has connections at the jail.

- que:
  - it did inspire your identity, did it not?

  - by the way, were the guys behind us told too?
  ans:
  - oh, of course.

- que:
  - where is he now?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid we've lost track of him.

- que:
  - won't we, colonel mac dougall?
  ans:
  - give me a break.

- que:
  - about two years, maybe?
  ans:
  - an armguard with approximately fifty meters of climbing wire.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i'm jean.

- que:
  - where's miesel?
  ans:
  - now i'm going to wring your neck...

- que:
  - but colonel, what if arcam gets into the ark?
  ans:
  - not to worry.

- que:
  - who was he?
  ans:
  - my old commander.

- que:
  - revenge?
  ans:
  - you think it's their fault that you're like this now or something.

- que:
  - so, this is noah's ark?
  ans:
  - it's bigger than i thought.

- que:
  - can't you open it?
  ans:
  - it's made of some kind of time stop material.

- que:
  - u. s. machine corps?
  ans:
  - cyborgs attached to the pentagon.

- que:
  - what's so funny?
  ans:
  - he'll be here soon.

- que:
  - move.
  ans:
  - who are you?

- que:
  - so, you're mac dougall?
  ans:
  - you have a magnetic amplifier implanted in your brain.

- que:
  - there must be some meaning behind the location of the ark.
  ans:
  - where's that kid?

- que:
  - what if the ark itself is what caused the flood?
  ans:
  - perhaps mt.

- que:
  - ararat exerts a strong magnetic field that suppresses it?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - who knows what might happen?
  ans:
  - i see...

- que:
  - where's the old man?
  ans:
  - inside, i guess.

- que:
  - why didn't you follow them?
  ans:
  - but...

- que:
  - let's get started, doctor.
  ans:
  - so, this is noah's heart?

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - take care.

- que:
  - why does the pentagon want it?
  ans:
  - using it would be like signing your own country's death warrant.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - noah probably caused the ice age that destroyed the dinosaurs, but it has other functions besides changing the atmosphere.

- que:
  - what are these things?
  ans:
  - in other words, noah is also a machine for the generation of life.

- que:
  - then i have no choice.
  ans:
  - well, doctor?

- que:
  - the majority of the land will be flooded.
  ans:
  - what are you going to do?

- que:
  - well, what will you do, doctor?
  ans:
  - there's no going back.

- que:
  - don't you get it yet?
  ans:
  - your orihalcon suit that you're so proud of is like a toy to me.

- que:
  - don't you understand that for them you're just an expendable item?
  ans:
  - neither the pentagon nor the machine corps concern me now.

- que:
  - is that all it took to drive you mad?
  ans:
  - we are not machines.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i said i'm not an instrument for killing.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're right.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - shut up and let me carry you.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - so, that's what the ark really looks like.

- que:
  - god!
  ans:
  - give me a break.

- que:
  - who the hell talks like that?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - someone's watching us.
  ans:
  - hey, what about my nipples?

- que:

  ans:

  - you got any objections, ricky?
  ans:
  - you don't wanna know.

- que:
  - too waxy?
  ans:
  - shh.

- que:
  - say, what do you think about smacking me in the face a couple of times?
  ans:
  - not hard.

- que:
  - what do you say?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who'd like to party?
  ans:
  - ooh, sorry.

- que:
  - who wants drinks?
  ans:
  - drinks, drinks, drinks.

  - how could somebody steal both boats?

  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - we tell the guests there's some crazed maniac on the island with no way off?
  ans:
  - we're gonna have a hundred crazed maniacs running around.

- que:
  - what about the sign on cliff?
  ans:
  - i mean, that means he's targeting us.

- que:
  - why are they coming after us?
  ans:
  - ahhh.

- que:
  - hank?
  ans:

  - who's the minneapolis mangler?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - we're gonna have to catch this guy.
  ans:
  - pete, you are aware that i personally have served this guy... twenty beers a day for the last 10 years, right?

  ans:
  - we couldn't even catch the bloody raccoon that was stealing my wristbands last month.

- que:
  - you didn't ask me to catch the raccoon, did you, pip?
  ans:
  - all right, now here's the plan.

- que:
  - how the hell are we supposed to do our job... when somebody is killing the dick out of everybody on the island?
  ans:
  - take it easy there, menstrual cramp.

- que:
  - what in the queen's wig is going on here?

- que:
  - how you find out about that?
  ans:
  - because i see everything, juan.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i think it's a good idea if we were to go down the beach a little more far.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - the two of us.

- que:
  - no bloody clothes?
  ans:
  - just pornography and an ass load of condoms.

  - you'll be all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i s there some sort of special significance?
  ans:
  - fuck no.

- que:
  - you got that?
  ans:
  - lars, you're up.

- que:
  - it all started when he got here, didn't it?
  ans:
  - sam, it isn't lars or any of us.

- que:

  ans:
  - shh, shh, shh.

- que:
  - what did i miss?
  ans:
  - apparently, somebody's gonna get killed by a shoe.

- que:
  - okay, you guys, instead of focusing on the song, why don't we go look for those boats?
  ans:
  - good idea.

- que:
  - jenny, why don't you and i go search together?
  ans:
  - um putman.

  ans:
  - i've never been to a place like this.

- que:
  - you are a gymnast?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - you know, put... during the sung dynasty, there was a great mystic master tsu tong po.

- que:
  - well, she has taken quite a fancy to you, hasn't she?
  ans:
  - but i have some... ammunition of my own.

- que:
  - what kind of man would i be if sat idly by while you stole her from me?
  ans:
  - do not underestimate me, lars.

- que:
  - now take that stupid bag off your head and give us a kiss.
  ans:
  - lars?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i didn't do anything.

- que:
  - he's not here?
  ans:
  - he left last night.

- que:
  - what, did you really think we wouldn't notice putman was gone if you came back with a boat?
  ans:

  - yes.

- que:
  - did he tell you it wasn't cancer?
  ans:
  - yes, he did.

  ans:
  - a lot of people do.

- que:
  - been, y y you know, quick, whatever you're saying?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you guess?
  ans:
  - you make a lot of noise and a lot of very odd sounds for someone that guesses.

- que:
  - you know what?

  - right?
  ans:
  - yeah, i guess so.

  ans:
  - i've got some bad news, charles.

- que:

  ans:
  - mr. scofield, looks like i'll be administering your shot today.

  - now, do you want the money or not?
  ans:
  - no offense, but it's a little convenient.

- que:
  - how do i know you're not lying right now?
  ans:
  - the way i see things, it's everyone else that's lazy.

- que:
  - you gonna let him talk about your people like that?
  ans:
  - uh, whatever, deliverance.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - we may be a team in here, but just so that you know, the minute we get over that wall, it's every man for himself.

- que:
  - do you know how the russians do things?
  ans:
  - they let you live, and they kill everyone else in your family, and, well, any anyone you've ever loved.

  ans:
  - well, hector says that you can serve your full sentence.

- que:
  - where's maricruz?
  ans:
  - she's not gonna be coming around here anymore.

- que:
  - this is a joke, right?
  ans:
  - she's with me now.

- que:
  - i want in.
  ans:
  - why would you need a credit card in prison?

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - we've got too many people.

- que:
  - where do you see yourself in five years?
  ans:
  - one suit, black.

- que:
  - that baby boy all growed up yet?
  ans:
  - oh, he's gonna raise hell the next few years.

- que:
  - you know what i mean, jimmy?
  ans:
  - there's a potential, uh, situation.

- que:
  - how much time?
  ans:
  - enough for me to find my way up a 20 foot vertical drain pipe without using a ladder.

- que:
  - well, i don't have a choice, do i?
  ans:
  - i can come and go without using the door, and with westmoreland as a lookout, we'll have one more man available for dig.

- que:
  - mind if i share that with the rest of the class?
  ans:
  - apparently, college boy here did the math.

- que:
  - how is this your problem, man?
  ans:
  - he doesn't know what he's talking about.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - oh, pardon me for interrupting.

- que:
  - but, uh... what's that smell?
  ans:
  - it smells a little like... conspiracy.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - look who you're walking with right now.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - scofield is only here for one reason:his brother.

- que:
  - and the night that fish goes into that hole, you think he wants to carry all that extra baggage?
  ans:
  - i don't know about you, but i'm going.

- que:
  - yeah, he probably tells you, the less you know, the better, right?
  ans:
  - you don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - i swiped you that watch, man.

- que:
  - where's my pl?
  ans:
  - that's not gonna happen.

  ans:
  - largely ceremonial.

- que:
  - why not mooseport?
  ans:
  - w well, sir, actually...

- que:
  - as your first move out of office, you become mayor?
  ans:
  - it's, uh, beneath you.

- que:
  - she can't claim this is a vacation house if i'm the mayor, can she?
  ans:
  - true.

- que:
  - sir, it's a touch more complicated than that.
  ans:
  - you have the eagle's word, okay?

- que:
  - what's complicated?
  ans:
  - it's just that, you see, sir, it kind of got out in the press that you're both in.

- que:
  - what press?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - did they, stu?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - what, are you telling me the entire country thinks i'm running for mayor... against the man installing my toilets?
  ans:
  - ah, hell!

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - that's bruce the moose, sir.

- que:
  - shouldn't it be in a zoo?
  ans:
  - afternoon, mr. president.

- que:
  - is everything okay with that water heater?
  ans:
  - everything is fine.

- que:
  - handy, aren't you gonna introduce me?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how can i help you, mr. president?
  ans:
  - well, handy, as i'm sure you know, we've both put in for mayor.

- que:
  - you didn't know that?
  ans:
  - i knew that i put in.

- que:
  - is it serious?
  ans:
  - well, it got out to the press that i had given my word.

- que:
  - are you any good?
  ans:
  - i get around.

- que:
  - ten?
  ans:
  - me too.

- que:
  - what's settled?
  ans:
  - it turns out we both put in for mayor, so i just withdrew.

- que:
  - did anybody happen to notice that?
  ans:
  - he probably chewed through the rope.

- que:
  - rude?
  ans:
  - don't be silly.

- que:
  - it is, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i'm so glad i ran into you.

- que:
  - dinner?
  ans:

  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - sally, is it me... or did you just get asked out by that president guy?
  ans:
  - yes, i think i did.

- que:
  - and and is it me or did you just say yes... to the president guy?
  ans:
  - yes, i think i did.

  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - thank you very much.
  ans:
  - what is it?

- que:
  - uh huh?

- que:
  - wh what is it?
  ans:
  - l... uh...

- que:
  - what just happened?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna look like an idiot.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - i don't need a campaign manager for this.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - one second.

- que:
  - you watching fox news?
  ans:
  - the results are quite interesting.

- que:
  - are you dr. sally mannis?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - is it true you've been seeing mr. harrison for six years?
  ans:
  - now you're dating the president.

- que:
  - for our mayor, we could have the president of the united states.
  ans:
  - you wouldn't call it a date?

- que:
  - what are you trying to do to us?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - hey, handy.
  ans:
  - handy!

- que:
  - do you like it?
  ans:
  - uh, that's... yeah.

- que:
  - do you care about sally or not?
  ans:
  - power takes 10 years off a man, handy.

- que:
  - up and running.
  ans:
  - so, you want to campaign or not?

- que:
  - so how do we kick this thing off, bert?
  ans:
  - top priority, obviously, is to keep him presidential.

- que:
  - and what exactly is he?
  ans:
  - preliminary research says that he is something... that actually we've never faced before, mr. president.

- que:
  - and that is?
  ans:
  - he's a genuinely honest man, sir.

- que:
  - what do you got, bert?
  ans:
  - f. b. i., c. i. a... nothing.

- que:
  - and, uh, that's it?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - that's good.
  ans:
  - what's wrong with this picture?

- que:
  - how do we get that out?
  ans:
  - whisper campaign, at first.

- que:
  - not to mention what it would do to his finances.
  ans:
  - should we discuss a withdrawal?

- que:
  - finances?
  ans:
  - book deals, corporate boards, library fund raising.

- que:
  - you what?
  ans:
  - it it seemed obvious.

- que:
  - but have you seen the car?
  ans:
  - look at this.

- que:
  - may i stay now, sir?
  ans:
  - go in the corner, out of my eye line.

- que:
  - what about this sally handy, sally eagle wank off?
  ans:
  - he'll have to cancel the date.

- que:
  - should i draft a press release?
  ans:
  - uh, yeah.

- que:
  - you see where i'm going with this, or do i have to draw you a picture?
  ans:
  - i see it, mr. president.

- que:
  - good morning, mr. president.
  ans:
  - handy, what are your policies?

- que:
  - you got toilet trouble, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - call him a horndog!
  ans:
  - well, uh...

- que:
  - where are you taking her?
  ans:
  - i don't know what you're gonna see.

- que:
  - do we have any ice cream?
  ans:
  - absolutely, sir.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - nothing to it.

- que:
  - you wanna see a movie or something?
  ans:
  - you know i have plans tonight.

- que:
  - did you see this?
  ans:
  - local vet finds romance with past president.

- que:
  - where'd they get that picture?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i mean, he must go to bed at, like, 8:30, right?
  ans:
  - so, there's supposed to be a meteor shower at 11:00.

- que:
  - can you just cancel the date with the president?
  ans:
  - so that's wednesday.

- que:
  - where are you taking her?
  ans:
  - the pig and the whistle, the only steakhouse in town.

- que:
  - do you know it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do i have anything in common with this girl?
  ans:
  - she's a veterinarian.

- que:
  - why don't you talk about mad cow disease?
  ans:
  - don't, by the way, order meat.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - it's just a guess, but she might not appreciate your wolfing down... the animal she spent all day trying to save.

- que:
  - wh what, do you... do you really actually like this guy?
  ans:
  - he wants to talk to me about dogs.

- que:
  - why you all dressed up then?
  ans:
  - because he's the president.

- que:
  - what difference does it make what color my underwear is?
  ans:
  - it's an unconscious indicator... of your subconscious intentions.

- que:
  - how do you feel about the pink?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - uh, these?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - or do you like any of these?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - or you know what?
  ans:
  - i could always go with none at all.

- que:
  - 8:00, for two, yes?
  ans:
  - well, i'll be buggered by a bear.

- que:
  - can you move that up?
  ans:
  - this feels wrong.

- que:
  - and him making her his booty poodle isn't?
  ans:
  - you have to stop saying that, please.

- que:
  - are we ready yet?
  ans:
  - uh, i hope you're hungry.

- que:
  - sally?
  ans:
  - uh, i'm not sure yet.

- que:
  - sometimes you just want a steak, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - ma'am?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - it's a nice night, isn't it?
  ans:
  - handy for mayor.

- que:
  - debate?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - well, now is not the time or place, handy... but, uh, let's say the town hall tuesday night.

- que:
  - okay, why don't we let everybody get back to their dinner?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - would you excuse me for just one minute?
  ans:
  - yes, certainly.

- que:
  - campaign?
  ans:
  - you're making a fool of yourself.

- que:
  - what's in it?
  ans:
  - they're, uh...

- que:
  - should i get it to the f. b. i.?
  ans:
  - yes.

  - it's going well, don't you think?
  ans:
  - mr. president, sir.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - was that a meteor?
  ans:
  - there's supposed to be a shower tonight.

- que:
  - maybe it's a good omen, huh?
  ans:
  - i just wanna apologize again for handy.

- que:
  - the president got vetoed.
  ans:
  - and you, sir?

- que:
  - can you believe it?
  ans:
  - definitely the cold shoulder.

- que:
  - cold shoulder?
  ans:
  - the president lost that one.

- que:
  - it's off.
  ans:
  - turn it off, all right?

- que:
  - well, how do we fix this?
  ans:
  - we don't.

- que:
  - what's wrong with the debate?
  ans:
  - putting him on the stage with you gives him credibility.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - n not weakness.

- que:
  - green boy.
  ans:
  - they know i'm kidding, don't they?

  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - rock, paper, scissors.
  ans:
  - no!

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - on the count of three.

- que:
  - clay?

- que:
  - where have you been?

  - what's got into you?
  ans:
  - now, intern, park sangmin will share a few words with us.

- que:
  - didn't you know?
  ans:
  - of course, it's not a sin to be married.

- que:
  - but in fact you're married to a 15 year old high school girl, right?
  ans:

  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - what the hell kind of way is that to make a decision?
  ans:
  - when you assemble the kind of talent that we have here, and then you just throw it away like that.

- que:
  - and now?
  ans:
  - ain't no way.

- que:
  - that's what it is.
  ans:
  - what about winchell's play tonight?

- que:

- que:
  - you ever feel cursed, coach?
  ans:
  - like, no matter what, inside your heart you feel that you're gonna lose.

- que:
  - why you gotta be so messed up?
  ans:
  - you can't win.

- que:
  - fact of the matter is, i believe that, uh, our only curses are the ones that are self imposed.

  - coaches ready?
  ans:

  - well, as far as i know, zebras are white and black.

- que:
  - how many black stripes these zebras got?
  ans:
  - i believe a zebra's got about the same amount ofblack ones as he does white ones.

- que:
  - how many black stripes you think a zebra's got?
  ans:
  - it makes sense to hire a crew as is.

- que:
  - so you think having an all black officiating crew is gonna somehow help you win the game?
  ans:
  - watch your mouth.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - oh, pretty good.

- que:
  - oh, is that right?

  ans:
  - i'm not certain, sir.

  - i'm all right.

- que:
  - what happened to you?
  ans:
  - leave him alone.

- que:
  - yes, but what is it?
  ans:
  - well, it has to do with time.

- que:
  - that's why you've been in hiding?
  ans:
  - very clever of you, indeed.

- que:
  - lf you don't mind, will you refresh me on the first three dimensions?
  ans:
  - really, filby.

- que:
  - what is the fourth dimension?
  ans:
  - that's mere theory.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - let's take that box.

- que:
  - what's inside?
  ans:
  - i'm coming to that.

- que:
  - why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
  ans:
  - because we can't move within it.

- que:
  - do you follow me, bridey?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - there are many things you don't understand, yes?
  ans:
  - quite a number.

- que:
  - yet you don't refuse to believe in them?
  ans:
  - not if i can see the proof myself.

- que:
  - doctor, can i have your help?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - this is only an experimental model.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - lnto the past or into the future.

- que:
  - lf you go to the future, won't you mess things up for us?
  ans:
  - the future's already there.

- que:

  ans:
  - lf you've gone mad, i forgive you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the experiment i'm about to perform.

- que:
  - you can spare a cigar, i trust?
  ans:
  - let us imagine that this cigar...

- que:
  - ready, gentlemen?
  ans:
  - lend me your hand, please.

- que:
  - go?
  ans:
  - nowhere, in the usual sense.

- que:
  - you expect us to believe that?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - then why can't we see it?
  ans:
  - because we're in this room on december 31, 1 899...... but the model is perhaps a hundred years away by now.

- que:
  - lf it's occupying the same space, why can't i feel it?
  ans:
  - the space you're putting your hand through is today's space.

- que:
  - contraption?
  ans:
  - i intend taking a journey into the future.

- que:
  - well, look here, george...... suppose you do go off to the 50th century...... how will you get back?
  ans:
  - that's a risk i'm ready to take.

- que:
  - have you thought of the commercial possibilities?
  ans:
  - no, i haven't.

- que:
  - what do you think, david?
  ans:
  - dr. hillyer has a good point, george.

- que:
  - are you all right, george?

  ans:
  - yes, i'll try.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - don't go simple on me.

- que:
  - a pharaoh?
  ans:
  - i prefer the future.

- que:
  - you saw the experiment, didn't you?
  ans:
  - no, i don't.

- que:
  - why not come home with me?
  ans:
  - you haven't seen jamey for a while.

- que:
  - what's stopping you?

  ans:
  - very little.

- que:
  - is the implication that dr. stone deliberately misled us?
  ans:
  - perhaps not deliberately, senator.

- que:
  - from what you're saying, it was just a shot in the dark?
  ans:
  - perhaps that's a little unfair, senator.

- que:
  - you mean more expensive, don't you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - he doesn't jump into things, dr. robertson.

- que:
  - what do you think, mr. secretary?
  ans:
  - it's against the moscow treaty of 1963... to fire thermonuclear weapons above ground.

- que:
  - yes, chief?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - by whose decision, general, was the site for wildfire chosen?
  ans:
  - dr. stone's.

- que:
  - weren't you worried the infection might spread to them?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, i was, but dr. stone and dr. robertson assured the president...

- que:
  - putting in the potholes?
  ans:
  - getting rid of the tread marks.

- que:
  - where's our leader?
  ans:
  - we'll catch up to him and hall very soon now.

- que:
  - why'd they pick hall?
  ans:
  - he's no scientist.

- que:
  - who needs an overpriced m. d.?
  ans:
  - relax and enjoy your cigarette.

- que:
  - something wrong?
  ans:
  - i never liked red lights.

- que:
  - you got the time?
  ans:
  - my watch stopped at 11:46.

- que:
  - they brought it on themselves.
  ans:
  - you, a sourdough?

- que:
  - what you said before, you don't believe the infection in that capsule was brought back deliberately, do you?
  ans:
  - skip it.

- que:
  - how'd you know that?
  ans:
  - oh, dutton, i have a long criminal record.

- que:
  - how's piedmont?
  ans:
  - i had to order up a 7 12.

- que:
  - how are you, ruth?
  ans:
  - no other way to halt the infection spread.

- que:
  - oh, you two know each other, don't you?
  ans:
  - by reputation only.

- que:
  - any messages for me from the white house?
  ans:
  - not a thing, dr. stone, or you'd have it.

- que:
  - no personal messages?
  ans:
  - no, ma'am.

- que:
  - are you sure, sergeant?
  ans:
  - dr. stone, sir, i have one thing to do.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - they'll be treated and returned to you, doctor.

- que:
  - who picked leavitt?
  ans:
  - talk about the odd man hypothesis, which we haven't yet.

- que:
  - what's it for?
  ans:
  - you're the odd man.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - never, we hope.

- que:
  - why me?
  ans:
  - because you're single.

- que:
  - where, exactly, are we now?
  ans:
  - there's one way you can always locate yourself or any of us instantly.

- que:
  - where's the capsule?
  ans:
  - the patients are the yellow x's.

- que:
  - what are their chances, hall?
  ans:
  - uncertain.

- que:
  - you really expect me to fire the thing?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid you don't understand.

- que:
  - new process.
  ans:
  - to wipe us out?

- que:

- que:
  - what do you think meehan will be saying to the boys?
  ans:
  - he'd be telling them that there's only 45 minutes left to play.

  ans:
  - it's like he's not even on the pitch.

- que:
  - what's up with you?
  ans:
  - i never touched you.

- que:
  - you're cheating now, are you?
  ans:
  - once a loser, always a loser.

- que:
  - where'd you get hit?

- que:
  - how are we supposed to defend ourselves?
  ans:
  - she's down the street.

- que:

- que:
  - so, you, um... you really kill people for a living?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:

  ans:
  - it's what i'm good at.

- que:
  - you want to pull the trigger, or should i do it?

  - oh, e.

- que:
  - why can't we tell her?
  ans:
  - we don't know anything about her.

- que:
  - your friend?
  ans:
  - she's the only one i have.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - yes.

  - what is this, yoga?
  ans:
  - no, it's called kimagure.

- que:
  - how do you do it?
  ans:
  - concentrate.

- que:
  - how long did it take you to master?
  ans:
  - we're still alive.

- que:
  - what you were doing there?
  ans:
  - that bird's been hanging around here since late yesterday.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - the war is over.

- que:
  - this whole war with the hand, everything, it's all about her, isn't it?
  ans:
  - they call her the treasure.

- que:
  - what if i had failed?
  ans:
  - some lessons can't be taught, elektra.

- que:
  - what about abby?
  ans:
  - as long as kirigi is alive, she's only safe here.

- que:
  - sorry?
  ans:
  - o. c. d.

- que:
  - are you counting?
  ans:
  - don't mock me.

- que:
  - wanna find out?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna go find my dad.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - to finish it, you and me.

- que:
  - agreed?
  ans:
  - agreed.

- que:
  - is that what the blind man's been teaching you?
  ans:
  - not good enough.

- que:
  - elektra?
  ans:
  - not exactly.

- que:
  - so, what's next?
  ans:
  - kirigi's gone.

- que:
  - back to school?
  ans:
  - go to the beach and get a tan.

- que:
  - will i see you again?
  ans:
  - we'll find each other.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - you didn't turn out so bad.

- que:
  - anyway, your second life's never really like your first, is it?
  ans:
  - sometimes... it's even better.

- que:
  - perimeter, what's your status?
  ans:
  - delta team, clear.

- que:
  - her?
  ans:
  - i was afraid if i told you, you wouldn't take the job.

- que:
  - who do you think's coming for you?
  ans:
  - you may have heard of her.

- que:
  - you find that funny?
  ans:
  - she's an urban legend, sir.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - well, then somebody must have brought her back from the dead.

- que:
  - delta, what's your status?
  ans:
  - there's no signal.

- que:
  - just cold?
  ans:
  - don't worry.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - i died once.

- que:
  - so am i to understand that with all the power of the hand... that the treasure continues to elude us?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you dare to blame master roshi?
  ans:
  - seems our methods are too mild for kirigi.

- que:
  - kirigi?
  ans:
  - yes, father.

- que:
  - you think that's safe, leaving the door unlocked like that?
  ans:
  - geez, elektra, you're gonna end up with a bullet in your head.

- que:
  - why do you always do this?
  ans:
  - get rid of my d. n. a.

- que:
  - it's all there?
  ans:
  - less my 10 .

- que:
  - half to barbados?
  ans:
  - and half to the bank on the isle of man.

- que:
  - was it necessary?
  ans:
  - had to be done.

- que:
  - did it?
  ans:
  - elektra.

- que:
  - did it?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - you're tired?
  ans:
  - well, then you better get yourself some sleep...

- que:
  - i mean, you even get laid?
  ans:

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - look, you want to take time off, take time off.

- que:

- que:
  - what happened down there?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm writing that down.

- que:
  - so, that's it then?
  ans:
  - no book.

- que:
  - now what do we do?
  ans:
  - this is what happens when you use the front entrance.

- que:
  - what is he doing here?
  ans:
  - at least he's not out robbing someone.

- que:
  - you hear that, guys?
  ans:
  - dinner and drinks are on the prince.

- que:
  - weapons?
  ans:
  - here she is.

- que:
  - so, which are you... a thief or a hero?
  ans:
  - sinbad wanted to give me an opportunity to thank...... him.

- que:
  - just like that?
  ans:
  - but the book is almost ours.

- que:
  - an old girlfriend?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid it's not that simple.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - l i...

- que:
  - you were talking about the ocean, weren't you?
  ans:
  - i only wish i'd seen more of it.

- que:
  - marina... will you marry me?
  ans:
  - proteus, i...

- que:
  - it's about time.
  ans:
  - huh?

- que:
  - then how do you explain this?
  ans:
  - eris.

  - eris... she framed me.

- que:
  - you know me.
  ans:
  - trial?

  ans:
  - i knew a kid.

- que:
  - who are you now, sinbad?
  ans:
  - look me in the eye and tell me.

- que:
  - did you steal the book?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - let him go to tartarus and recover the book.
  ans:
  - how many times do i have to say it?

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - you claim that eris stole the book... steal it back.

- que:
  - tartarus?
  ans:
  - oh, no, no, no, no.

- que:
  - so where are we going?
  ans:
  - fiji.

- que:
  - this time of year?
  ans:
  - think of the beaches.

- que:
  - dymas is not going to let them execute his only son.
  ans:
  - you're sure of that?

- que:
  - so we're running away?
  ans:
  - we're retiring.

- que:
  - what do you think you're doing here?
  ans:
  - i'm here to make sure you get the book of peace.

- que:
  - and how are you going to pull that off?
  ans:
  - by whatever means necessary.

- que:
  - did you bring a crew?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you know how to get to tartarus?
  ans:
  - um... no.

- que:
  - then i'll dump your butt in a rowboat, and you can paddle all the way back to syracuse.
  ans:
  - can you navigate on your own?

- que:
  - fiji?
  ans:
  - yup.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - sinbad, you're not a very complicated guy.

- que:
  - you're really not going to lose any sleep over this, are you?
  ans:
  - not a wink.

- que:
  - uh... just how do you expect to do that?
  ans:
  - by speaking your language.

- que:
  - how did she even get on the ship?
  ans:
  - gentlemen, we have a new course.

- que:
  - no beaches?
  ans:
  - rat.

- que:
  - but did you say tartarus?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - will that be the same tartarus from which no sailor ever returns?
  ans:
  - the tartarus of lost souls, where they grind your bones and pickle your spleen, and...

- que:
  - you know, with little umbrellas?
  ans:
  - non ci posso credere, non ci posso credere, mi hanno fregato ancora.

- que:
  - so how do we get there?
  ans:
  - that star's our point.

- que:
  - the dragon's teeth?
  ans:
  - indeed, signorina.

- que:
  - are you sure you know what...?
  ans:
  - yes, we've done this kind of thing before.

- que:
  - what is that sound?
  ans:
  - come with me.

- que:
  - who's bad?
  ans:
  - sinbad saved us.

- que:
  - uh...
  ans:
  - marina saved us?

- que:
  - do you have any idea what i went through to steal these?
  ans:
  - that's exactly why women shouldn't drive.

- que:
  - you happy now?
  ans:
  - proteus, come quickly.

- que:

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and is this what you always wanted?

  ans:
  - i bet you thought i wouldn't make it.

  ans:
  - william thatcher, answer me with your name.

- que:
  - and technique?
  ans:
  - i have a month to learn that.

- que:
  - how did the nobles become noble in the first place?
  ans:
  - they took it at the tip of a sword.

- que:
  - but a full stomach?
  ans:
  - that dream can come true.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - money doesn't matter.

- que:
  - and you shouldn't.
  ans:
  - see how hungry i am?

- que:
  - and what would you do with my name, sir hunter?
  ans:
  - call me a fox, for that is all i am to you.

- que:
  - does this not shock you, ladies?
  ans:
  - certainly, my lord.

- que:
  - why, god, did you curse me with this face?
  ans:
  - god's will has a purpose, but we may not know it.

- que:
  - ulrich von lichtenstein?
  ans:
  - i am simon the summoner.

- que:
  - what are we supposed to do?
  ans:
  - he assured us that you, his liege, would pay us.

- que:
  - and who are you?
  ans:
  - peter, a humble pardoner...... and purveyor of religious relics.

- que:
  - how much does he owe?
  ans:
  - we, on behalf of the lord god...... will take it from his flesh so that he may understand...... that gambling is a sin.

- que:
  - please, will you help me, sir ulrich?
  ans:
  - i promise you won't regret it.

- que:
  - lsn't that why we're here?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - do you want to touch him?
  ans:
  - we should've saved for the blacksmith.

- que:
  - a woman?
  ans:
  - beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the other armorers.

- que:
  - did they say i couldn't do it because i'm a woman?
  ans:
  - they said you're good with horseshoes, not armor.

- que:
  - do you only pretend to fight, count adhemar, or wage real war as well?
  ans:
  - i am leader of the free companies.

- que:
  - what do you think of the joust?
  ans:
  - it's very abrupt.

- que:
  - do men die in the joust?
  ans:
  - lance points are tipped with coronals, which blunts them.

- que:
  - and you are?
  ans:
  - i am, um....

- que:
  - have you forgotten?
  ans:
  - ulrich von lichtenstein from gelderland.

- que:
  - was she watching?
  ans:
  - geoff.

- que:
  - did she see me?
  ans:
  - yes, she did.

- que:
  - did she see me take the hit?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - was she concerned?
  ans:
  - her eyes welled up.

- que:
  - how so?
  ans:
  - the slit in the visor is narrow, but splinters can penetrate it.

- que:
  - why didn't ulrich finish him?
  ans:
  - he shows mercy.

- que:
  - her name?
  ans:
  - her name is aphrodite.

- que:
  - would you have sir ulrich win the tournament for you?
  ans:
  - william, here.

- que:
  - a knight?
  ans:
  - you might as well try to change the stars.

- que:
  - can a man change the stars?
  ans:
  - yes, william.

- que:
  - have you enough clothes?
  ans:
  - be gone.

- que:
  - what on earth could you possibly do to us?
  ans:
  - i will eviscerate you in fiction.

- que:
  - so, what of it?
  ans:
  - i could make armor you wouldn't even know you wore it.

- que:
  - what's the cost?
  ans:
  - just take me as far as paris.

- que:
  - why are we leaving so soon?
  ans:
  - the next tournament is in a week.

- que:
  - my lady would know the color of your lord's tunic tonight.
  ans:
  - let adhemar laugh at me again?

- que:
  - his tunic?
  ans:
  - yes, so she can dress to match him.

- que:
  - what color is my tunic tonight?
  ans:
  - green.

- que:
  - you can hit me all day because you punch like a what?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - is there another way?
  ans:
  - sir ulrich, you look fantastic.

- que:
  - or a basse dance?
  ans:
  - sir ulrich.

- que:
  - why don't you show us a dance of your country?
  ans:
  - show us a dance of gelderland.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what are these?
  ans:
  - the marks of my trade should another knight admire the armor.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - i didn't feel a thing.

- que:
  - who's that knight?
  ans:
  - piers courtenay.

- que:
  - you mad?
  ans:
  - you endanger a royal family member.

- que:
  - you knew me?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and still you rode?
  ans:
  - it's not in me to withdraw.

- que:
  - don't you get tired of putting on clothes?
  ans:
  - she's talking about taking them off.

- que:
  - a flower is only as good as its petals, no?
  ans:
  - a flower is good for nothing.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - you can't eat a flower.

- que:
  - you're just a silly girl, aren't you?
  ans:
  - better a silly girl with a flower than a silly boy with a horse and stick.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - adhemar was called back to the free companies.

- que:
  - was that wrong?
  ans:
  - well, it's up to you, really.

- que:
  - her breasts?
  ans:
  - yes, you could, but i would tend to look above her breasts.

- que:
  - i miss her throat?
  ans:
  - still higher.

- que:
  - the moon?
  ans:
  - the moon.

- que:
  - did she read the letter?
  ans:
  - yes, and yes.

- que:
  - did she give me a token?
  ans:
  - she did.

- que:
  - well, what is it?
  ans:
  - give it to me.

- que:
  - ulrich against every frenchman here?
  ans:
  - he's won four tournaments in a row.

- que:
  - shut your mouth, all right?
  ans:
  - as sure as the sun will rise.

- que:
  - don't you think?
  ans:
  - it's beautiful.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - i'll win this tournament in your name.

- que:
  - really? lts flanks?
  ans:
  - i wish to hear poetry, ulrich.

- que:
  - why must everything for a woman be run on a man's schedule?
  ans:
  - well, a man's day is fuller, and...... he has more demands on his time.

- que:
  - ls that so?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - i demand poetry...... and when i want it.

- que:
  - do you ask in earnest?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - instead of winning to honor me with your high reputation...... act against your character and do badly.

- que:
  - do badly?
  ans:
  - i will not lose.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - losing.

- que:
  - i saw it, okay?
  ans:
  - i know.

  - proof of what?
  ans:
  - her legs weren't uncrossed for nothing.

- que:
  - it's very romantic, though.
  ans:
  - then why are we doing this?

- que:
  - are you a woman or a blacksmith?
  ans:
  - sometimes i'm both.

- que:

  ans:
  - wat, you remember church as a boy.

  - isn't she watching?
  ans:
  - forty eight...... forty nine...... and fifty.

- que:
  - at his mum's for christmas?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i should probably go, shouldn't i?
  ans:
  - you could go pose as santa, try and shag some carol singers.

- que:
  - she's right, marcus.
  ans:
  - are you a professional santa?

- que:
  - just leave it, okay?
  ans:
  - all he did was make up a kid for a couple weeks.

- que:
  - he bought me trainers, he lets me go round to his house and he knows what kids need.
  ans:
  - so what?

- que:
  - expensive footwear and obscene music?
  ans:
  - if there's something you really need then we can talk about it.

- que:
  - remember why?
  ans:
  - because you threw a loaf of bread at a duck's head and killed it, basically.

- que:
  - okay.
  ans:
  - excuse me?

- que:
  - am i in television?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so what do you do?
  ans:
  - i'm sort of taking a bit of time off at the moment.

- que:
  - time off from what?
  ans:
  - to be absolutely honest, time off from time off, in fact.

- que:
  - you don't do anything?
  ans:
  - actually, no.

- que:
  - what's your name?
  ans:
  - marcus.

- que:
  - and where will that get us?
  ans:
  - and stop telling strangers to shake their ass.

- que:
  - why did you tell this lady i was your son?
  ans:
  - no, i didn't tell her.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - we're really going around in circles here.

- que:
  - just accept the facts, okay?
  ans:
  - you're my son.

- que:
  - for christ's sake!
  ans:
  - that's a load of shit.

- que:
  - what's so interesting about her?
  ans:
  - okay, marcus, here.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what's the difference between a girl who's your friend and a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - well, i don't know.

- que:
  - yeah, you've heard about sex, right?
  ans:
  - it is kind of a big deal.

- que:
  - okay, how do i look?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - just be as normal as you can, okay?
  ans:
  - good advice for marcus.

- que:
  - ali?
  ans:
  - all i could do was stand there, grinning like an idiot.

- que:
  - should we just go upstairs?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah, i think i've seen you around.

- que:
  - yeah, sounds good, right?
  ans:
  - i'm not really sure it's up to me.

- que:
  - yeah, it's just that i can't really do much at the moment, can i?
  ans:
  - i mean, will, that's my dad...... he likes your mum, and i think she's keen on him.

- que:
  - am i boring you?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - did i?
  ans:
  - i think it's sweet how much he seems to take after you...... and the way he dresses like you, as well.

- que:
  - he said he'd cut me up into little pieces and hide me under the floorboards.
  ans:
  - marcus?

- que:
  - he did?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - doesn't he?
  ans:
  - sorry, marcus.

- que:
  - don't you, mate?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - yeah, but i didn't know that then, did i, sexy?
  ans:
  - all i'm saying is, you know, watch out.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - it's just that you and rachel....

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - i don't know, i think there's a problem with you and rachel.

- que:
  - if you're going to be with someone...... shouldn't you tell them things like that?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - but later that night, when i was on my own...... i remembered the deal marcus was prepared to strike.

- que:
  - would he be buying me shoes soon?
  ans:
  - i took his advice and told rachel the truth.

- que:
  - if you're not his natural father...... and you don't live with him, then how is he your son?
  ans:
  - yeah, i see.

- que:
  - you want some chinese rice wine, miss?
  ans:
  - you would like to try, i suspect, the panang paneng.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did i?
  ans:
  - it's what you chose to believe.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i didn't know what the answer was.

- que:
  - at the rock concert?
  ans:
  - i don't think that would be a very good idea, marcus.

- que:
  - will you accompany me?
  ans:
  - all i've got is a tambourine.

- que:
  - at what?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - what do you mean, what?
  ans:
  - the crying.

- que:
  - didn't you hear me?
  ans:
  - i heard you.

- que:
  - what do you want me to do about it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - who am i to her?
  ans:
  - i'm nobody.

- que:
  - who do you think you are?
  ans:
  - you come here uninvited, you disrupt my life, you screw things up.

- que:
  - what do you want from me?
  ans:
  - this isn't my problem.

- que:
  - we've established pretty firmly that i'm not your father, either, am i?
  ans:
  - but....

- que:
  - i'm the guy who's really good at choosing trainers or records, okay?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - how could you?
  ans:
  - you're a stupid person who watches tv all day...... and buys things.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - he's a load of crap.

- que:
  - you made him up?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - what?

- que:
  - pardon?
  ans:
  - and then eventually, she will ask you...

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - then you will respond by saying...... nothing.

- que:
  - just like that?
  ans:
  - i call it the passive aggressive bullet to the head.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - that reminds you who you are.

  ans:
  - no, i hate it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - about the talking.

- que:
  - so why'd you cut the hair?
  ans:
  - to keep you, dumb ass.

  - at least...... i didn't think i was.

- que:
  - was i in love with her when i did it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - think so?
  ans:
  - of course it's jealousy, that's what i'm saying.

- que:
  - why would i be jealous if i wasn't in love?
  ans:
  - because we trip like that sometimes.

- que:
  - what you think i should do?
  ans:
  - buy her something.

  - she cut her hair?
  ans:

  ans:
  - ltself.

- que:
  - but double dealing?
  ans:
  - totally unacceptable.

- que:
  - is that what you swear?

  ans:

  - you got any idea how much pain you're making in my life?
  ans:
  - hey, look at me.

  - you cut yourself.

- que:
  - you shot him.
  ans:
  - what's wrong?

- que:
  - why'd you fucking shoot him?
  ans:
  - if you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.

- que:
  - and what is it you do?
  ans:
  - i watch.

- que:
  - yes, well, what else is there to do...... when life turns on you and you've retreated into some small room?
  ans:
  - you look out your window.

- que:
  - are you in need of immediate police or medical response?
  ans:
  - shit.

- que:
  - that why you killed leon?
  ans:
  - i didn't kill leon because of the way he dressed.

  - did they dress too nice?
  ans:
  - you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.

- que:
  - run?
  ans:
  - no, i'm not a coward like some people i know.

  - shouldn't we wait on the esu negotiator?
  ans:
  - they could take 20 minutes.

- que:
  - what's yours?
  ans:
  - i don't want to be friends.

- que:
  - is that who you're talking to on the phone?
  ans:

- que:
  - you see a fucking gun anywhere?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you want to see it?
  ans:
  - mustn't tell him, stu.

- que:
  - who do you keep talking to on the phone?
  ans:
  - nobody.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - careful, stuart.

- que:
  - what's this doctor's name?
  ans:
  - it would be really helpful to us if we knew.

- que:
  - he says not to tell you, all right?
  ans:
  - it's privileged information.

- que:
  - all i want to know is, what happened, man?
  ans:
  - tell him to read you your rights.

- que:
  - so now, can you at least give me your first name?
  ans:
  - just your first name.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - i want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.

- que:
  - you won't let me put my hand in my pocket?
  ans:
  - we'll take it out for you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - ask him a question.

- que:
  - are you gonna step out of the booth?
  ans:
  - i can't.

- que:
  - you're not stepping out of the booth?
  ans:
  - ask him.

- que:
  - both your lives depend on it.
  ans:
  - is that a no?

- que:
  - does he masturbate on lonely nights?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - should we give ourselves up?
  ans:
  - maybe i'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.

- que:
  - i mean, you've got connections, right?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - diane sawyer?
  ans:
  - look, i, i, i don't know.

  ans:
  - look, it's our friends from channels two and five.

- que:
  - can you tap into that phone call?
  ans:
  - should be no problem.

- que:
  - look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
  ans:
  - as long as we don't listen in.

- que:
  - we get that?
  ans:
  - i want somebody to find out what's going on.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - think about it.

- que:
  - listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right?
  ans:
  - you'd get barbara walters...... i mean, larry king if you still wanted him.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.

- que:
  - so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - or do you want to leave this to a professional?
  ans:
  - until a professional gets here, i'll handle it.

- que:
  - this is what i want to do, okay?
  ans:
  - this is the city hotel here.

- que:
  - not going to answer it?
  ans:
  - i can't.

- que:
  - how can you be so sure?
  ans:
  - it's you.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - this lady says the perp's her husband.

- que:
  - who do you think he's talking to?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
  ans:
  - yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no...

- que:
  - who's his psychiatrist?
  ans:
  - he doesn't have one.

- que:
  - captain?
  ans:
  - if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.

- que:
  - what about that wire tap?
  ans:
  - we're working on it.

- que:
  - you gotta hold tight a while, all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, no problem.

- que:
  - does he like being called stuart or stu?
  ans:
  - stu.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah, i'm fine.

- que:
  - what?

  - but beautiful women always know.

- que:
  - you talking about kelly?
  ans:
  - that false indifference, superior air...... it's just a tease.

- que:
  - they want eyes on them. why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
  ans:
  - not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - stay away from her.

- que:
  - leave her out of this.
  ans:
  - right?

- que:
  - how many times...... have you had sex with pam in that hotel bedroom in your head? would you really miss kelly if she was gone?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - your choices put other people in jeopardy. when are you gonna learn that?
  ans:
  - this is funny.

- que:
  - still gonna give me the silent treatment?
  ans:
  - hello.

  - you'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - with a big fucking smile on my face.

  ans:
  - because it's fun.

- que:

  ans:
  - you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.

- que:
  - okay, how does this end?
  ans:
  - tell me how this ends.

- que:
  - what about that phone call to your store?
  ans:
  - i got a phone call this afternoon.

- que:
  - how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
  ans:
  - if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.

- que:
  - it would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
  ans:
  - please get back in the car.

- que:
  - want me to clear the streets?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  - you wanna wake up, stu?
  ans:
  - i wanna, but i got issues i can't talk about.

- que:
  - that your psychiatrist on the phone?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

  - you got some bad news on that call?
  ans:
  - the worst.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:

  - all this shit just to watch me die?
  ans:
  - no.

  ans:
  - no, not yet.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - stuart, i'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.

- que:
  - what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
  ans:
  - not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.

- que:
  - these are my crimes?
  ans:
  - stuart, i know your crimes.

- que:
  - somebody got a 20 on this pam?
  ans:

- que:
  - now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?
  ans:
  - i love that.

- que:
  - now why didn't he have it cocked?
  ans:
  - because that sound is scary.

- que:
  - it's cool, isn't it?
  ans:
  - look, you shoot a gun here and there'll be pandemonium.

  - you got any idea how much pain you're making in my life?
  ans:
  - hey, look at me.

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:
  - leon, he told us to fuck off.

  ans:
  - you cut yourself.

- que:
  - you shot him.
  ans:
  - what's wrong?

- que:
  - why'd you fucking shoot him?
  ans:
  - if you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.

- que:
  - you shoot the guy, and i'm fucking responsible?
  ans:
  - well, looked that way from up here.

- que:
  - and what is it you do?
  ans:
  - i watch.

- que:
  - what was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
  ans:
  - i'm trying to help you, stu, but you won't help yourself.

- que:
  - what fucking deception?
  ans:
  - shit.

- que:
  - that why you killed leon?
  ans:
  - i didn't kill leon because of the way he dressed.

- que:
  - did they dress too nice?
  ans:
  - you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.

- que:
  - run?
  ans:
  - no, i'm not a coward like some people i know.

- que:
  - yeah, what if they open fire?
  ans:
  - they won't.

- que:
  - do you see the tourists with the video cameras?
  ans:
  - don't worry, they'll keep the police on their best behavior.

- que:
  - you call this safe?
  ans:
  - i got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.

- que:
  - i give the orders here, stu, don't i?
  ans:
  - this guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.

- que:

  ans:
  - well, that's not gonna happen.

- que:
  - vietnam?
  ans:
  - yes, vietnam.

- que:
  - i'm gonna go talk to him.
  ans:

- que:
  - shouldn't we wait on the esu negotiator?
  ans:
  - they could take 20 minutes.

- que:
  - what's yours?
  ans:
  - i don't want to be friends.

- que:
  - is that who you're talking to on the phone?
  ans:

  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you want to see it?
  ans:
  - mustn't tell him, stu.

- que:
  - who do you keep talking to on the phone?
  ans:
  - nobody.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - careful, stuart.

- que:
  - what's this doctor's name?
  ans:
  - it would be really helpful to us if we knew.

- que:
  - he says not to tell you, all right?
  ans:
  - it's privileged information.

- que:
  - all i want to know is, what happened, man?
  ans:
  - tell him to read you your rights.

- que:
  - so now, can you at least give me your first name?
  ans:
  - just your first name.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - i want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.

- que:
  - you won't let me put my hand in my pocket?
  ans:
  - we'll take it out for you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - ask him a question.

- que:
  - are you gonna step out of the booth?
  ans:
  - i can't.

- que:
  - you're not stepping out of the booth?
  ans:
  - ask him.

- que:
  - both your lives depend on it.
  ans:
  - is that a no?

- que:
  - does he masturbate on lonely nights?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - should we give ourselves up?
  ans:
  - maybe i'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.

- que:
  - i mean, you've got connections, right?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - why the fuck would larry king come here?
  ans:
  - because you're friends.

- que:
  - diane sawyer?
  ans:
  - look, i, i, i don't know.

- que:
  - what about yours?
  ans:
  - look, it's our friends from channels two and five.

- que:
  - can you tap into that phone call?
  ans:
  - should be no problem.

- que:
  - look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
  ans:
  - as long as we don't listen in.

- que:
  - we get that?
  ans:
  - i want somebody to find out what's going on.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - think about it.

- que:
  - listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right?
  ans:
  - you'd get barbara walters...... i mean, larry king if you still wanted him.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.

- que:
  - so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - or do you want to leave this to a professional?
  ans:
  - until a professional gets here, i'll handle it.

- que:
  - this is what i want to do, okay?
  ans:
  - this is the city hotel here.

- que:
  - not going to answer it?
  ans:
  - i can't.

- que:
  - i'm not gonna make her feel any better, am i?
  ans:
  - well, you could ask her to forgive you, stuart.

- que:
  - how can you be so sure?
  ans:
  - it's you.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - this lady says the perp's her husband.

- que:
  - who do you think he's talking to?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
  ans:
  - yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no...

- que:
  - who's his psychiatrist?
  ans:
  - he doesn't have one.

- que:
  - captain?
  ans:
  - if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.

- que:
  - what about that wire tap?
  ans:
  - we're working on it.

- que:
  - you gotta hold tight a while, all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, no problem.

- que:
  - does he like being called stuart or stu?
  ans:
  - stu.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah, i'm fine.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - but beautiful women always know.

- que:
  - you talking about kelly?
  ans:
  - that false indifference, superior air...... it's just a tease.

- que:
  - why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
  ans:
  - not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - stay away from her.

- que:
  - don't i dare?
  ans:
  - i'm not the one who has hurt her, stuart.

- que:
  - leave her out of this.
  ans:
  - right?

- que:
  - would you really miss kelly if she was gone?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - when are you gonna learn that?
  ans:
  - this is funny.

  - i want you to do it quickly, and i want you to do it quietly.

- que:
  - where's the esu sergeant?
  ans:
  - you said we could go.

- que:
  - besides the fear of death?
  ans:
  - i dive out and you've got one shot.

- que:
  - you think you can get me?
  ans:
  - i could go for some target practice.

- que:
  - what's up next to the florescent bulb?
  ans:
  - check it out, stu.

- que:
  - you'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - with a big fucking smile on my face.

- que:
  - see the pink curtains?
  ans:
  - because it's fun.

- que:
  - isn't that what you wanted?
  ans:
  - you know where i am, and you have a gun.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the motel.

- que:
  - let's just see what he does, all right?
  ans:
  - let's see what he's doing.

- que:
  - how do you figure?
  ans:
  - you get to choose between them.

- que:
  - should i choose?
  ans:

- que:
  - don't you get the game yet?
  ans:
  - you're a selfish guy.

- que:
  - blond or brunette?
  ans:
  - time's running out.

- que:
  - i can't take this anymore.
  ans:
  - you or them?

- que:

  ans:
  - what are you doing?

- que:
  - you gonna let me take this over?
  ans:
  - tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.

- que:
  - what're you doing?
  ans:
  - you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.

- que:
  - okay, how does this end?
  ans:
  - tell me how this ends.

- que:
  - what about that phone call to your store?
  ans:
  - i got a phone call this afternoon.

- que:
  - how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
  ans:
  - if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.

- que:
  - it would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
  ans:
  - please get back in the car.

- que:
  - want me to clear the streets?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you wanna wake up, stu?
  ans:
  - i wanna, but i got issues i can't talk about.

- que:
  - that your psychiatrist on the phone?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - it was liberating, right?
  ans:
  - should've been.

- que:
  - what the fuck do you want?
  ans:
  - it's my world.

- que:

  ans:
  - never.

- que:
  - you got some bad news on that call?
  ans:
  - the worst.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - so this is all some religious thing?
  ans:
  - that explains it.

- que:
  - kill myself?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - all this shit just to watch me die?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - everything?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - anything?
  ans:
  - no, not yet.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - stuart, i'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.

- que:
  - what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
  ans:
  - not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.

- que:
  - these are my crimes?
  ans:
  - stuart, i know your crimes.

- que:
  - somebody got a 20 on this pam?
  ans:
  - don't blame her.

- que:
  - yeah, what if they open fire?
  ans:
  - they won't.

  ans:
  - don't touch that, you'll break it.

- que:
  - pee?
  ans:
  - if he is, that's a shame for the pilots of the adriatic.

- que:
  - is that plane up front yours?
  ans:
  - yeah, it's a plane of the rattle snake, bringing me fame and fortune.

- que:
  - you're up to no good, aren't you?
  ans:
  - i'm glad you came, but don't play war games.

- que:
  - hey, what are you doing!?
  ans:
  - porco, tell me the whole story.

  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - is it ok, like usual?
  ans:
  - we have a new supply of an incendiary bomb.

- que:
  - could you tell me the difference between a soldier and a bounty hunter?
  ans:
  - one's scum if he can't win in war.

- que:
  - who ever heard of an air pirate who was deep in debt?
  ans:
  - we had nothing to barter with, captain.

- que:
  - why do i have to stay with such pathetic looking group?
  ans:
  - it's due to the pig, the crimson pig.

- que:
  - hey, is the american around?
  ans:
  - you, stingy...

- que:
  - are you hurt?
  ans:
  - i was about to leave to pick you up.

- que:
  - do you think i'm a bulletin board or something?
  ans:
  - however much i'm worried about you guys...

- que:
  - why don't you just build another one?
  ans:
  - i want to keep this one.

- que:
  - who's the cute girl?
  ans:
  - my granddaughter, from america.

- que:
  - i need 15 knots more.
  ans:
  - is she really your granddaughter?

- que:
  - curtis?
  ans:
  - i've hear of him.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - this is a hallvolley, isn't it.

- que:
  - are you going to take all of my money?
  ans:
  - these days, wads of bills aren't worth a damn.

- que:
  - are they all right?
  ans:
  - all three left to look for work.

- que:
  - then... who is going to design my plane?
  ans:
  - she is young, but she's got something my sons lack.

- que:
  - or, do you think i'm too young to do it?
  ans:
  - both, miss.

- que:
  - experience?
  ans:
  - no, inspiration, i think.

- que:
  - but let me do the job, will you?
  ans:
  - if i don't do it well, don't pay me.

- que:
  - ok, grandpa?
  ans:
  - she's my granddaughter, she'll do well.

- que:
  - could you sleep here tonight?
  ans:
  - i'll make your bed tomorrow.

- que:
  - did you stay up all night?
  ans:
  - this is the rough plan.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i want to redesign this wing section, leaving the plane shape as it is.

- que:
  - there's a 5 degree angle to the wings here, right?
  ans:
  - everything should be fine then.

- que:
  - you'll let me continue with this, then?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - is she going to build this plane by herself?
  ans:
  - yes, i'd like to have some money for my great grandchildren.

- que:
  - there are no men here, right?
  ans:
  - yup.

- que:
  - these are all relatives of yours?
  ans:
  - yes, they don't have any jobs these days.

- que:
  - you don't think curtis is worth it?
  ans:
  - sure, this is a good idea.

- que:
  - so, you're a major?
  ans:
  - you've moved up in the world, fierrali.

- que:
  - why did you come back?
  ans:
  - i make it a rule to go wherever i want to.

- que:
  - were you followed?
  ans:
  - i gave them the slip.

- que:
  - you are a pig after all, huh?
  ans:
  - thanks for your advice, fierrali.

- que:
  - porco, need a ride?
  ans:
  - hey, you're a life saver.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i gave them the slip.

- que:
  - a spy?
  ans:
  - i'm going, too.

- que:
  - do you understand what you are saying?
  ans:
  - shh...

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - this really fits.

- que:
  - would you hold that?
  ans:
  - look, miss.

- que:
  - and, if you're going to fight curtis... you'll need a good mechanic, won't you?
  ans:
  - look, i'm a man, you know.

- que:
  - are you really her grandfather?
  ans:
  - you don't have to pay her.

- que:
  - you really want her to be wanted by the police?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - kind of like a tomboy, just like you.

- que:
  - is he following us?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you know him?
  ans:
  - the air force lies in wait up ahead.

- que:
  - that means o. k., then?
  ans:
  - gina, come to hollywood with me.

- que:
  - i like you for such foolishness.
  ans:
  - and, then?

- que:
  - really!?
  ans:
  - life is more complicated here than in your country.

- que:
  - kid...?
  ans:
  - i hit my head because you did an acrobatic maneuver all of a sudden.

- que:
  - that was her in the white dress on the hotel terrace, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - my grandpa told me that every pilot in the adriatic sea falls in love with gina.

- que:
  - you fell in love with her too, didn't you, porco?
  ans:
  - he is talking with my dad.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you should offer yourself to one side or the other.

- que:
  - you got a cigarette?
  ans:
  - curtis will go back to america sooner or later.

- que:
  - is that byron?
  ans:
  - no, it's me.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - she made my plane much better then before.

- que:
  - you mean it, porco?
  ans:
  - miss, there's a complicated reason behind this.

- que:
  - would you step back?
  ans:
  - you guys don't understand a word i said.

- que:
  - aren't you ashamed that you need the help of that american, curtis?
  ans:
  - if your mother heard of that, she would cry.

- que:
  - boss, what are we supposed to do?
  ans:
  - she convinced us.

- que:
  - do we ask him to fight the pig, again?
  ans:
  - the contract is already over.

- que:
  - will you marry me if i win?
  ans:
  - i'm serious.

- que:
  - are you going to fight or not?
  ans:
  - i'm willing to fight for love.

- que:
  - we are partners, aren't we?
  ans:
  - we are going to have a hard time.

- que:
  - trust me, eh?
  ans:
  - i haven't heard that in a long time, but i'm glad you said that.

- que:
  - you feel sick?
  ans:
  - i should have padded the deal.

- que:
  - having trouble sleeping?
  ans:
  - just now...

- que:
  - why did you become a pig?
  ans:
  - you're a nice kid.

- que:
  - my story?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - white sky?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i was flying alone over the sea, almost touching it.
  ans:
  - belneldi, you're alive?

- que:
  - god said it wasn't your time yet, didn't he?
  ans:
  - in my mind, i thought he might let me fly like that forever.

- que:
  - are they all air pirates?
  ans:
  - the scum of the mediterranean... gangs,... pirates, smugglers,... spies,... and even a few ordinary people.

- que:
  - my mom told me you're going to like me soon.
  ans:
  - do you understand?

- que:
  - give me that.
  ans:
  - may i take a picture with you?

- que:
  - looping?
  ans:
  - i got it.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the pig doesn't kill anybody.

- que:
  - she's in her room, and won't come out.
  ans:
  - are you teasing me or what?

- que:
  - does she want to go or not?
  ans:
  - i want to see that fight myself...

- que:
  - f?
  ans:
  - must be from fierrali.

- que:
  - jammed?
  ans:
  - you're finished.

- que:
  - can't you fly any faster?
  ans:
  - it's impossible.

- que:
  - did you see my punch?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna take him down next round.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you can't have both.

- que:
  - marco.
  ans:
  - gina?

- que:
  - thank you.
  ans:
  - marco, can you hear me?

  - take a shower sometime, will you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i'm going to lead them off.

  - can we hear all the way to alaska?
  ans:
  - on a really clear day.

- que:
  - can we hear all the way to china?
  ans:
  - on a really, really clear day.

- que:
  - could we talk to the moon?
  ans:
  - if it's a big enough radio, i don't see why not.

- que:
  - or what's the one after that?
  ans:
  - i don't think even the biggest radio could reach that far.

- que:
  - do you think there's people on other planets?
  ans:
  - i don't know, sparks.

- que:

  ans:

  - it'll do.

- que:
  - when can i get dish time?
  ans:
  - right there, that's it.

- que:
  - that much?
  ans:
  - about what i'd expect after what he had to say about you.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - those were the highlights.

- que:
  - cracker jack?
  ans:
  - no, thanks.

  ans:
  - glad you could make it.

- que:
  - how is that new office?
  ans:
  - still settling in.

- que:
  - not unlike my l band, globular clusters work.
  ans:
  - still waiting for e. t. to call?

- que:
  - even profitable?
  ans:
  - nothing, as long as your motive...... is the search for truth.

- que:
  - you're a priest?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - you see that large w shaped constellation there?
  ans:
  - that's cassiopeia.

- que:
  - when did you know you wanted to be an astronomer?
  ans:
  - he said that it wasn't a star.

- que:
  - and there's no chance that...... you had this experience because some part of you needed to have it?
  ans:
  - i'm a reasonably intelligent guy, but this....

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - and pretty soon they asked my dad...... if he wouldn't mind keeping me home from now on.

- que:
  - is it this guy?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you're close to him, aren't you?

  ans:
  - drumlin pulled the plug.

- que:
  - it's true, you pulled the plug?
  ans:
  - you can't see it now, but i'm doing you a favor.

- que:
  - did that investor from houston ever get back to us?
  ans:
  - i'll hit him up on my way to l. a.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - two guys wanted to build a thing called an airplane.

- que:
  - science fiction, right?
  ans:
  - all i'm asking is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision.

- que:
  - how was the trip?
  ans:
  - there's been enormous pressure from other scientists as well.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - staring at tv static for hours, listening to washing machines.

- que:
  - just this once?
  ans:
  - we lost.

- que:
  - who would make the best astronomers?
  ans:
  - think about it.

- que:
  - who has the perfect synthesis of career and lifestyle?
  ans:
  - no, not at all.

- que:
  - is the world fundamentally a better place...... because of science and technology?
  ans:
  - we're becoming a synthesized society...... in a hurry to get to the....

- que:
  - what is the meaning?
  ans:
  - we have mindless jobs, take frantic vacations.

- que:
  - there's a bad drive on 16.
  ans:
  - any wonder we've lost our sense of direction?

- que:
  - what shall i do about the source queue?
  ans:
  - forget it and hold the queue.

- que:
  - run every frequency you can think of.
  ans:

- que:
  - how you doing?
  ans:

- que:
  - we recording?
  ans:
  - never stopped.

- que:
  - on this frequency?

  - no.

- que:
  - whatever it is, it ain't local.
  ans:
  - how's spying tonight?

- que:
  - position?
  ans:
  - i checked interferometry.

- que:
  - it's only 26 light years away.
  ans:
  - vega?

- que:
  - maybe they're not from there, they're visiting.
  ans:
  - peak intensity?

- que:
  - spacecraft?
  ans:
  - this system's full of debris.

- que:
  - do you have a source location yet?
  ans:
  - we put it right smack in the middle.

- que:
  - who do we call now?
  ans:
  - everybody.

- que:
  - where's the girl?
  ans:
  - 22 stations worldwide...... now confirm the signal.

- que:
  - why not just speak english?
  ans:
  - maybe because 70 of the planet speaks other languages.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - it's hardly yesterday.

- que:
  - excuse me, who are you?
  ans:
  - michael kitz, national security advisor.

- que:
  - who are all these people?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - you think a civilization sending this message intends it just for americans?
  ans:
  - you might have consulted us.

- que:
  - you want to classify prime numbers?
  ans:
  - due to earth's rotation, we're in line with vega only hours a day.

- que:
  - hear what?
  ans:
  - harmonic.

- que:
  - patch it into the image processor.
  ans:
  - what is it?

- que:
  - want the new data?
  ans:
  - yeah, the new one we just recorded.

- que:
  - what do you make of that?
  ans:
  - it's two different interlaced frames.

- que:
  - can you clean it up?
  ans:
  - i'm working on it.

- que:
  - what the hell...?
  ans:
  - you're not going to believe this.

- que:
  - does anybody speak german?
  ans:
  - i declare the games in berlin...... at the celebration...... of the first olympics of the new era...... as opened.

- que:
  - 20 million people died defeating the bastard...... and he's our first ambassador to outer space?
  ans:
  - hitler's politics have nothing to do with this.

- que:
  - fish, what is the story over here?
  ans:
  - i thought ellie was supposed to be on.

- que:
  - those interlaced frames we thought were noise?
  ans:
  - this has structure.

- que:
  - is there a renewed assessment of security threat?
  ans:
  - i'll answer your questions after a few corrections.

- que:
  - no two are alike and we've uncovered over 10, 000 already.
  ans:
  - are you ready?

- que:
  - what does it mean, doctor?
  ans:
  - we have no idea.

- que:
  - how long will it take to decode it?
  ans:
  - i'm going to recommend that dr. drumlin coordinate the decryption effort.

- que:
  - understood?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - are these the kind of people...... that you want talking to your god for you?
  ans:
  - i'll be there.

- que:
  - i presume?
  ans:
  - mr. hadden.

- que:
  - you live here?
  ans:
  - i find it convenient to keep my interests...... mobile.

- que:
  - what am i doing here?
  ans:
  - you'll see.

- que:
  - that does what, doctor?
  ans:
  - we don't know.

- que:
  - transport?
  ans:
  - there's no proof of that.

- que:
  - why risk the personnel?
  ans:
  - it could be a weapon.

- que:
  - why is it the egghead position that aliens are always benign?
  ans:
  - we pose no threat to them.

- que:
  - how guilty would we feel if we destroyed a few microbes on an anthill?
  ans:
  - i hope you're right.

- que:
  - are you?
  ans:
  - mr. joss, the president's waiting.

- que:
  - see you at the reception?
  ans:
  - yeah, i wouldn't miss it.

- que:
  - miss constantine, may i speak to you?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - here we go.
  ans:
  - do you know where i can find a really great dress?

- que:
  - it's like you're saying that...... science killed god.
  ans:
  - you want me to quote you?

- que:
  - what if science simply revealed...... that he never existed in the first place?
  ans:
  - i think we need to get some air.

- que:
  - ever heard of it?
  ans:
  - hoccam's razor.

- que:
  - so what's more likely?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - an all powerful god created the universe...... then decided not to give any proof of his existence?
  ans:
  - or...... that he doesn't exist at all and that we created him...... so we wouldn't feel so small and alone.

- que:
  - how do you know you're not deluding yourself?
  ans:
  - i mean, for me...... i'd need proof.

- que:
  - your dad, did you love him?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - you were right all along.

- que:
  - who goes?
  ans:
  - different nations are being compensated in different ways.

- que:
  - on what basis do you choose...... a human being to represent humanity?
  ans:
  - good question, larry.

- que:
  - how do you respond?
  ans:
  - this message is from a civilization that may be anywhere...... from hundreds to millions and millions of years ahead of us.

- que:
  - faith?
  ans:
  - i was going to say, a sense of adventure.

- que:
  - but what can i say to this?
  ans:
  - meet me at noon.

- que:
  - can we talk about einstein?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - it's a historic opportunity.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - from as long as i can remember, i've been searching for...... something...... some reason why we're here.

- que:
  - who are we?
  ans:
  - if this is a chance to find out even a part of that answer....

- que:
  - don't you?
  ans:
  - you're an incredibly brave woman, ellie.

- que:
  - how did you survive technological adolescence...... without destroying yourself?
  ans:
  - that more than any other question is one i personally would like answered.

- que:
  - would you consider yourself...... a spiritual person?
  ans:
  - as a scientist...... i rely on empirical evidence, and in this matter...... i don't believe that there's data either way.

- que:
  - why'd you do it?
  ans:
  - our job was to select someone to speak for everybody.

- que:
  - mechanical?
  ans:
  - go.

- que:
  - safety?
  ans:
  - crew ops, verify all pre test procedures are complete.

- que:

  ans:
  - looks good.

- que:
  - mechanical, you still happy?
  ans:
  - roger.

- que:
  - david, how's it looking to you?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - the question everyone here is asking is...... what happens then?
  ans:
  - others believe it might open up a doorway to some other dimension.

- que:
  - who's right?
  ans:
  - that's what today's test is all about.

- que:
  - subsystems ready?
  ans:
  - 40 normal acceleration.

- que:
  - gerry, can you confirm?
  ans:
  - everything looks good.

- que:
  - crew ops?
  ans:
  - nothing wrong.

- que:
  - i think we're okay, but we'll let him finish.
  ans:
  - what's he talking about?

- que:
  - mechanical, you still okay?
  ans:
  - he shouldn't be there.

- que:
  - can you hear me?
  ans:
  - yes, i hear.

- que:
  - see him?
  ans:
  - in a related story...

- que:
  - can i help you?
  ans:

- que:
  - how kind of you to call.
  ans:
  - mr. hadden?

- que:
  - mr. hadden, where are you?
  ans:
  - the russian government was kind enough to give me accommodations on mir.

- que:
  - you're living on a space station?

- que:
  - have you forgotten that the arvernes have proclaimed a republic?
  ans:
  - but let us put aside these petty rivalries.

  - do you forget that it was you who hired the teuton mercenaries... to conquer other lands?
  ans:
  - the romans are no menace.

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - it's time for me to do what i must.

- que:
  - would you like to join me?
  ans:
  - for a while.

- que:
  - what keeps you here so far from rome?

  - the same thing that kept you hidden in the woods... and now sets you on my road.

- que:
  - are you a druid?
  ans:
  - no, i chose another path.

- que:
  - i wonder where he comes from.
  ans:
  - do you think he could win back gergovia by himself?

- que:
  - what do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - setting my house in order...

- que:
  - can you believe it?
  ans:
  - you are welcome among us.

- que:
  - why haven't your spies found the archdruid?
  ans:
  - i'm sure he's the one who teaches them... to believe in perpetual changes.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i get seasick.

- que:
  - for the thousands of slaves?
  ans:
  - you still owe us what you borrowed to pay for the festivals.

- que:
  - to conquer britain?
  ans:
  - i'm sending the gauls.

- que:
  - king?
  ans:
  - vercingetorix, no.

- que:
  - so dumnorix, still afraid of the sea?
  ans:
  - i guarantee that the sea will be calm.

- que:
  - he offers us half the booty, and that's not enough for you?
  ans:
  - it's too much.

- que:
  - and what have you become, now?
  ans:
  - a civilised and educated woman.

- que:
  - lmpressed by a roman general who is even more impressed with himself?
  ans:
  - i am, after all, an impressive man.

- que:
  - to drive your legions from gaul?
  ans:
  - too many tribes.

- que:
  - why not a king chosen by destiny?
  ans:
  - i knew you would come.

- que:
  - you're jealous?
  ans:
  - i think often of the young boy of gergovia... to whom i gave a token of my fidelity.

- que:
  - why do you think he brought us together?
  ans:
  - it's always wise to assume caesar knows everything he should know.

- que:
  - what is that supposed to mean epona?
  ans:
  - you are and will always be... the leader of great warriors.

- que:
  - ls the silver tongued vercingetorix trying to convince me... or does the leader of great warriors want to bring me back by force?
  ans:
  - we might as well talk, we can always fight to death later.

- que:
  - what order of caesar did you come to execute, riding his own horse?
  ans:
  - to bring you back to be tried according to our laws.

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - even if he were furious, and he must be...

- que:
  - what gaul would embark for britain if he executed his children?
  ans:
  - he will not do it.

- que:
  - what do we do now?
  ans:
  - i thought to offer you my horse... and then together, let's go to avenge the death of your father.

- que:
  - let's go.
  ans:
  - have you never asked yourself... who would set eduens against eduens, and arverne against arverne?

- que:
  - what does this hand mean?
  ans:
  - that we have made an enemy... and it would have been much better to have him as a friend.

- que:
  - evacuate the city... or i will burn it to ashes with your people still inside.
  ans:
  - ls gutuart still alive?

- que:
  - what right do you have, arvern?
  ans:
  - i can't let the romans take avaricum with all its supplies.

- que:
  - or will i live to regret it?
  ans:
  - you did what you thought was right... instead of what you knew was necessary.

- que:
  - was that a mistake?
  ans:
  - might does not make right... nor does wrong.

- que:
  - do you think so?
  ans:
  - now we will do what vercingetorix hasn't done.

- que:
  - you accuse me of treason?
  ans:
  - then kill me.

- que:
  - useless?
  ans:
  - there's no one there.

- que:
  - what do you see after the victory?
  ans:
  - i see all the peoples of gaul united.

- que:
  - under the dark desire of revenge?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - the cadurques shall follow... the orders of the eduens.

- que:
  - and do you still trust the leader of the great warriors... who wanted you to be his queen?
  ans:
  - at the time i accepted when i was asked by the boy.

- que:
  - and now?
  ans:
  - i'd be honoured to be asked by the king of the arvernes.

- que:
  - but what?
  ans:
  - well, i might be gone for an eternity.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - help him.

- que:
  - to us.
  ans:
  - you want to be my squire?

- que:
  - do you know who the goddess of alesia is?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - no, who?
  ans:
  - it's the horse goddess epona.

- que:
  - leave here?
  ans:
  - i thought you wanted one great final battle, just like caesar.

- que:
  - ls it what gaul really needs?
  ans:
  - no... but now the die is already cast.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm saving the rat for those traitors.

- que:
  - or you doubt their faithfulness because they haven't arrived yet?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, you're right.

- que:
  - what are you afraid of?
  ans:
  - the deep silence of others.

- que:
  - what is it going to change?
  ans:
  - spring will still come, grass will still grow by itself... and now caesar is besieged in his own fortifications.

- que:
  - what if they don't attack?
  ans:
  - then we die.

- que:
  - and what will decide?
  ans:
  - destiny, brutus.

- que:
  - won't you play with us?
  ans:
  - one toss, catch with one hand.

- que:
  - you want to live forever?
  ans:
  - then i will lead you, and together... we will become immortal.

- que:
  - and now what are we to do?
  ans:
  - well, it's up to him.

- que:
  - where will it lead you?
  ans:
  - i've always known that i would always love you.

- que:
  - nervous?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - okay?

  ans:
  - clone pets are every bit as safe as real pets.

  ans:
  - of course i would.

- que:
  - but he'd be cured?
  ans:
  - he'd be exactly the same.

- que:

  ans:
  - i've lost count.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - four dots means...... she's been cloned four times.

- que:

  ans:
  - so, you see...... your family isn't really your family.

- que:
  - you have a better idea?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:

  ans:
  - that is sirius black, that is.

- que:

  ans:
  - only that he's escaped from azkaban.

- que:
  - do you know why?
  ans:
  - thirteen years ago, when you stopped...

- que:
  - mr. weasley...... why would i go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
  ans:
  - quick.

- que:
  - who do you think that is?
  ans:
  - professor r. j. lupin.

- que:
  - how is it she knows everything?
  ans:
  - it's on his suitcase, ronald.

- que:
  - do you think he's really asleep?
  ans:
  - seems to be.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i gotta tell you something.

- que:
  - sirius black escaped from azkaban...... to come after you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - but they'll catch black, won't they?
  ans:
  - i mean, everyone's looking for him.

- que:
  - why are we stopping?
  ans:
  - we can't be there yet.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - harry.

  - harry, are you all right?

  - thank you.

- que:
  - what was that thing that came?
  ans:
  - it was a dementor.

- que:
  - what happened to me?
  ans:
  - well, you sort of went rigid.

- que:
  - and did either of you two...... you know...... pass out?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i mean, you actually fainted?
  ans:
  - shove off, malfoy.

- que:
  - how did he find out?
  ans:
  - just forget it.

- que:
  - you call that a monkey?
  ans:
  - do not give him one again.

- que:
  - what do you see?
  ans:
  - the truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i've been here all this time.

- que:
  - is your grandmother quite well?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - are you in the beyond?
  ans:
  - i think you are.

- que:
  - what's the grin?
  ans:
  - not the grin, you idiot.

- que:
  - you don't think that grim thing's got anything to do with sirius black?
  ans:
  - oh, honestly, ron.

- que:
  - exactly how many classes are you taking?
  ans:
  - a fair few.

- que:
  - how could anyone be in two classes at once?
  ans:
  - broaden your minds.

- que:
  - exactly how do we do that?
  ans:
  - just stroke the spine, of course.

- que:
  - isn't he beautiful?
  ans:
  - say hello to buckbeak.

- que:
  - hagrid, exactly what is that?
  ans:
  - that, ron, is a hippogriff.

- que:
  - now, who'd like to come and say hello?
  ans:
  - i think he may let you ride him now.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - how am i doing me first day?
  ans:
  - it comes and it goes.

- que:
  - he's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
  ans:
  - that's not far from here.

- que:
  - dementors?
  ans:
  - he slipped past them once.

- que:
  - who's to say he won't do it again?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - would anyone like to venture a guess...... as to what is inside?
  ans:
  - that's a boggart, that is.

- que:
  - now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
  ans:
  - no one knows.

- que:
  - when did she get here?
  ans:
  - boggarts are shape shifters.

- que:
  - neville, would you join me, please?
  ans:

  - neville, what frightens you most of all?
  ans:
  - professor snape.

- que:
  - sorry?
  ans:
  - professor snape.

- que:
  - can you do that?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you want to know why i stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
  ans:
  - i thought it'd be obvious.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.

- que:
  - to enter hogwarts castle on one's own......completely undetected?
  ans:
  - quite remarkable, yes.

- que:
  - any theories on how he managed it?
  ans:
  - many.

- que:
  - should he be warned?
  ans:
  - perhaps.

- que:
  - that's not really your concern, is it, potter?
  ans:
  - suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching...... at the present time.

- que:
  - no one?
  ans:
  - how disappointing.

- que:
  - are you incapable of restraining yourself...... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know it all?
  ans:
  - he fell over 100 feet.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - oh, brilliant.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - well, you fell off your broom.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i meant the match.

- que:
  - who won?
  ans:
  - no one blames you, harry.

- que:
  - is there no chance of fixing it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i mean, more than everyone else?
  ans:
  - it's the secret to our success.

- que:
  - is that really...?
  ans:
  - dumbledore.

- que:
  - so this map shows...?
  ans:
  - from filch's office.

- que:
  - now, how much do you want?
  ans:
  - delicious.

- que:
  - did i mention that?
  ans:
  - twice.

- que:
  - to the shrieking shack?
  ans:
  - actually, i'm fine here.

- que:
  - don't your family sleep in one room?
  ans:

  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - oh, you're still here, are you?
  ans:
  - yes.

  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - jean marc fleury?
  ans:
  - we were at this summer camp together, and he was a swimmer.

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - yes, your turn.

- que:
  - have you ever been in love?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - after i went into detail about my sexual feelings?
  ans:
  - they're different questions.

- que:
  - i mean, what if i asked you about love?
  ans:
  - i would have lied, but at least i would have made up a great story.

- que:
  - love is a complex issue, you know?
  ans:
  - i mean, yes, i've told somebody that i love them, and i've meant it.

- que:
  - was it a beautiful thing?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what's a problem for you?
  ans:
  - you, probably.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i had a thought the other day that kind of...... qualifies as a problem.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it was a thought i had on the train, so...

- que:
  - do you believe in reincarnation?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - a lot of people talk about past lives and things like that, you know?
  ans:
  - and even if they don't believe in it in some specific way...... people have a notion of an eternal soul.

- que:
  - are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?
  ans:
  - if they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...... in the last 50, 000 years, which is a blip in the earth's time.

- que:
  - is that why we're so specialized?
  ans:
  - wait a minute, i'm not sure...

- que:
  - have you heard of this singer?
  ans:
  - i think she's american.

- que:
  - do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?

- que:
  - why were all the bodies washing up?
  ans:
  - i think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

- que:
  - that's a river, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you know...

- que:
  - but you know what?
  ans:
  - it doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

- que:
  - did your parents divorce?
  ans:
  - yeah, finally.

- que:
  - you know, i've been wondering lately...... do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - oh, mr. romantic up in the ferris wheel?
  ans:

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - that is a stranger to you?
  ans:
  - i guess so.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - she knew i was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...... and that i was going to become this great woman.

- que:
  - that's way condescending, you know?
  ans:
  - i mean, she wasn't even doing me.

- que:
  - would you like that?
  ans:
  - you're so...

- que:
  - transitory?
  ans:
  - transitory.

- que:
  - you think this is open?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you're close with your grandmother?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you know anything about the quakers, the quaker religion?
  ans:
  - no, not much.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's not the appropriate place to tell it.

- que:
  - would you be in paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?
  ans:
  - no, not yet.

- que:
  - what would you be doing?
  ans:
  - i'd probably be hanging around the airport...... crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - oh, i see.

- que:
  - so i'm just a dumb american...... momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?
  ans:
  - i'm having a great time.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - me too.

- que:
  - if we were always around each other...... what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what about me bugs you?
  ans:
  - she flew into a rage and broke up with me.

- que:
  - what is it about me bugs you?
  ans:
  - nothing at all.

- que:
  - if it had to be something, what would it be?
  ans:
  - if it had to be something, if i had to think about it...... i kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

- que:
  - what the hell is a rooster prick?
  ans:
  - you were like a boy whining...... because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

- que:
  - this woman robs you blind, okay?
  ans:
  - you were like a boy walking by an ice cream store...... crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i understand a little, but he doesn't at all.

- que:
  - may i ask you a question?
  ans:
  - so i would like to make a deal with you.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - pick a word.

- que:
  - milk shake?
  ans:
  - oh, good.

- que:
  - so, were we having our first fight back there?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?
  ans:
  - there's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i got a poem.

- que:
  - will you read it to us?
  ans:
  - great.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he probably didn't just write that.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - you know what drives me crazy?
  ans:
  - people talking about...... how great technology is, how it saves all this time.

- que:
  - but what good is saved time if nobody uses it?
  ans:
  - if it just turns into more busy work.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - you wanna go in here?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - wanna go?
  ans:
  - hello.

  - you gonna buy me a beer?
  ans:

- que:
  - you got a boyfriend waiting on you back in paris or anything like that?
  ans:
  - no, not right now.

- que:
  - six months ago?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm sorry.

- que:
  - she was gonna kill her boyfriend?
  ans:
  - yeah, she was.

- que:
  - she had to call the police?
  ans:
  - she was totally convinced i was really gonna do it.

- que:
  - so what happened then?
  ans:
  - i totally got over him.

- que:
  - why is it you become obsessed with people you don't...... really like that much?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are you with anyone?
  ans:
  - it's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you sound like you just were hurt.

- que:
  - do i?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - your girlfriend?
  ans:

- que:
  - you know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?
  ans:
  - believe me, i know.

  ans:
  - didn't help your pinball.

- que:
  - not lately?

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - on this island, i think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - there's something to that.

- que:
  - so who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?
  ans:
  - women say they hate it if you're all protective.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

- que:
  - you wanna stop talking about this?
  ans:
  - i hate it.

- que:
  - should i give her some money?
  ans:
  - everything that's interesting costs a little money.

- que:
  - so a birth dance, huh?
  ans:
  - looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

- que:
  - you all don't need us?
  ans:
  - men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

- que:
  - certain insects do that, like spiders and stuff?
  ans:
  - we let you live.

- que:
  - what are you complaining about?
  ans:
  - see, you're officially kidding.

- que:
  - i always make fun of it and stuff...... but isn't everything we do in life...... a way to be loved a little more?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i know, it's almost impossible to succeed...... but who cares really?
  ans:
  - the answer must be in the attempt.

- que:
  - where is the waitress?
  ans:
  - in new york, she'd be out of a job.

- que:
  - you wanna talk in english, for laughs?
  ans:
  - yeah, okay.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - probably.

- que:
  - he's from there?
  ans:

  - on the train.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - us men are so stupid.

- que:
  - don't they?
  ans:

- que:
  - but then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - but don't you think that's what...... makes our time and specific moments so important?
  ans:
  - yeah, i know.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - actually, i don't know.

- que:
  - you'd hate to fly, right?
  ans:
  - i'm not so scared of flying.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no, let's just be rational adults about this.

- que:
  - it's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?
  ans:
  - people exchange numbers, addresses.

- que:
  - yeah, why?
  ans:
  - it's stupid.

- que:
  - it's the only way, no?
  ans:
  - well, all right.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's just...

- que:
  - it's depressing, no?
  ans:
  - now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...... when we'll have to say goodbye.

- que:
  - your hand?
  ans:
  - for the greatest night in your life.

- que:
  - what about our rational, adult decision?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - to be kissed.

- que:
  - we die in the morning, right?
  ans:
  - i think we should.

- que:
  - you don't want to see me again?
  ans:
  - no, of course i do.

- que:
  - why do we make everything so complicated?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what's the first thing you'll do when you get back to paris?
  ans:
  - call my parents.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you have a dog?
  ans:
  - i love dogs.

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:

  ans:
  - i don't know.

  ans:
  - i don't want that.

- que:
  - you don't?
  ans:
  - i waited for you to say it.

- que:
  - why didn't you say something?
  ans:
  - i was afraid you didn't wanna see me.

- que:
  - what do you wanna do?
  ans:
  - maybe we should meet here in five years or something.

- que:
  - five years?
  ans:
  - that's a long time.

- que:
  - how about one year?
  ans:
  - one year.

- que:
  - six months?
  ans:
  - it's gonna be freezing.

- que:
  - who cares?

  ans:
  - la sorbonne.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - you're coming from budapest?
  ans:
  - i was visiting my grandmother.

- que:
  - how is she?
  ans:
  - she's okay.

- que:
  - she's all right?
  ans:
  - she's fine.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i'm going to vienna.

- que:

- que:
  - you were visiting friends or just on your own?
  ans:
  - i had a friend in madrid, but...

- que:
  - so has this trip around europe been good for you?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's had its...

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - well, you know, for instance...... you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

- que:
  - want to hear one?
  ans:
  - tell me.

- que:
  - do you know what that is?
  ans:
  - anybody can produce a show real cheap, and they have to put it on.

- que:
  - all those mundane, boring things...... everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?
  ans:
  - you say it your way.

- que:
  - who's gonna watch?
  ans:
  - think about it like this.

- que:
  - why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...... is so beautiful?
  ans:
  - it is.

- que:
  - but a guy taking money from a bank machine...... looks like a complete moron?
  ans:
  - so it's like a national geographic program, but on people.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - yeah, i can see it.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - not service oriented.

- que:
  - but you know what?
  ans:
  - if your parents never...... fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive...

- que:
  - you know what i mean?
  ans:
  - i hate it.

- que:
  - and then finally, i let go of the nozzle, you know?
  ans:
  - and then i dropped the hose...... and she disappeared.

- que:
  - you get off here, no?
  ans:
  - yeah, what a drag.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i want to keep talking to you.

- que:

  - just for tonight.

- que:
  - what could you be expecting?
  ans:
  - we're on honeymoon.

- que:
  - you're actors?
  ans:
  - not professional.

- que:
  - you have a real cow on stage?
  ans:
  - no, an actor in a cow costume.

- que:
  - the big ferris wheel?
  ans:
  - we should go.

- que:
  - 2130?
  ans:
  - it's at 9:30.

- que:
  - what's the name of this play?
  ans:
  - i'm wilmington's cow.

- que:
  - you'll be there?
  ans:
  - we'll try.

- que:
  - are you ready?
  ans:
  - it's q and a time.

- que:
  - we ask each other questions?
  ans:
  - and you have to answer honestly.

- que:
  - my first sexual feelings?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - jean marc fleury?
  ans:
  - we were at this summer camp together, and he was a swimmer.

- que:
  - did you?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - yes, your turn.

- que:
  - have you ever been in love?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - after i went into detail about my sexual feelings?
  ans:
  - they're different questions.

- que:
  - i mean, what if i asked you about love?
  ans:
  - i would have lied, but at least i would have made up a great story.

- que:
  - love is a complex issue, you know?
  ans:
  - i mean, yes, i've told somebody that i love them, and i've meant it.

- que:
  - was it a beautiful thing?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you know playboy magazine?
  ans:
  - i've heard of it.

- que:
  - you don't know crystal?
  ans:
  - well, i knew crystal.

- que:
  - is it my turn now?
  ans:
  - tell me something that really pisses you off.

- que:
  - what else?
  ans:
  - i hate...

- que:
  - the media?
  ans:
  - yeah, the media.

- que:
  - is that all?
  ans:
  - well, there's a lot of things, but...

- que:
  - what's a problem for you?
  ans:
  - you, probably.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i had a thought the other day that kind of...... qualifies as a problem.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it was a thought i had on the train, so...

- que:
  - do you believe in reincarnation?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - a lot of people talk about past lives and things like that, you know?
  ans:
  - and even if they don't believe in it in some specific way...... people have a notion of an eternal soul.

- que:
  - are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?
  ans:
  - if they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...... in the last 50, 000 years, which is a blip in the earth's time.

- que:
  - is that why we're so specialized?
  ans:
  - wait a minute, i'm not sure...

- que:
  - have you heard of this singer?
  ans:
  - i think she's american.

- que:
  - do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?
  ans:
  - yeah, okay.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - it's tiny.

- que:
  - how old are these?
  ans:
  - around the beginning of the century.

- que:
  - why were all the bodies washing up?
  ans:
  - i think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

- que:
  - that's a river, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - it seems like...... this would be a... what?
  ans:
  - you know...

- que:
  - but you know what?
  ans:
  - it doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

- que:
  - did your parents divorce?
  ans:
  - yeah, finally.

- que:
  - you know, i've been wondering lately...... do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - oh, mr. romantic up in the ferris wheel?
  ans:
  - oh, kiss me.

- que:
  - what were you saying about her?
  ans:
  - check these guys out.

- que:
  - can i tell you a secret?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i made eye contact.

- que:
  - you want your palm read?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - i'm sure.

- que:
  - how much is it?
  ans:
  - for you, 50.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - that is a stranger to you?
  ans:
  - i guess so.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - she knew i was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...... and that i was going to become this great woman.

- que:
  - that's way condescending, you know?
  ans:
  - i mean, she wasn't even doing me.

- que:
  - would you like that?
  ans:
  - you're so...

- que:
  - transitory?
  ans:
  - transitory.

- que:
  - you think this is open?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you're close with your grandmother?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you know anything about the quakers, the quaker religion?
  ans:
  - no, not much.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's not the appropriate place to tell it.

- que:
  - would you be in paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?
  ans:
  - no, not yet.

- que:
  - what would you be doing?
  ans:
  - i'd probably be hanging around the airport...... crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - oh, i see.

- que:
  - so i'm just a dumb american...... momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?
  ans:
  - i'm having a great time.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - me too.

- que:
  - if we were always around each other...... what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what about me bugs you?
  ans:
  - she flew into a rage and broke up with me.

- que:
  - what is it about me bugs you?
  ans:
  - nothing at all.

- que:
  - if it had to be something, what would it be?
  ans:
  - if it had to be something, if i had to think about it...... i kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

- que:
  - what the hell is a rooster prick?
  ans:
  - you were like a boy whining...... because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

- que:
  - this woman robs you blind, okay?
  ans:
  - you were like a boy walking by an ice cream store...... crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

- que:
  - i don't care what this charlatan has to say about... what?
  ans:
  - i understand a little, but he doesn't at all.

- que:
  - may i ask you a question?
  ans:
  - so i would like to make a deal with you.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - pick a word.

- que:
  - milk shake?
  ans:
  - oh, good.

- que:
  - so, were we having our first fight back there?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?
  ans:
  - there's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i got a poem.

- que:
  - will you read it to us?
  ans:
  - great.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he probably didn't just write that.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - you know what drives me crazy?
  ans:
  - people talking about...... how great technology is, how it saves all this time.

- que:
  - but what good is saved time if nobody uses it?
  ans:
  - if it just turns into more busy work.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - you wanna go in here?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - wanna go?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - you gonna buy me a beer?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you got a boyfriend waiting on you back in paris or anything like that?
  ans:
  - no, not right now.

- que:
  - six months ago?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm sorry.

- que:
  - she was gonna kill her boyfriend?
  ans:
  - yeah, she was.

- que:
  - she had to call the police?
  ans:
  - she was totally convinced i was really gonna do it.

- que:
  - so what happened then?
  ans:
  - i totally got over him.

- que:
  - why is it you become obsessed with people you don't...... really like that much?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are you with anyone?
  ans:
  - it's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you sound like you just were hurt.

- que:
  - do i?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - your girlfriend?
  ans:
  - my ex girlfriend...... who has been on this art history program for the last year.

- que:
  - you know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?
  ans:
  - believe me, i know.

- que:
  - did it work?
  ans:
  - didn't help your pinball.

- que:
  - not lately?
  ans:
  - that's good.

- que:
  - are you talking about monkeys?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i never heard this one.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - on this island, i think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - there's something to that.

- que:
  - so who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?
  ans:
  - women say they hate it if you're all protective.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

- que:
  - you wanna stop talking about this?
  ans:
  - i hate it.

- que:
  - should i give her some money?
  ans:
  - everything that's interesting costs a little money.

- que:
  - so a birth dance, huh?
  ans:
  - looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

- que:
  - you all don't need us?
  ans:
  - men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

- que:
  - certain insects do that, like spiders and stuff?
  ans:
  - we let you live.

- que:
  - what are you complaining about?
  ans:
  - see, you're officially kidding.

- que:
  - i always make fun of it and stuff...... but isn't everything we do in life...... a way to be loved a little more?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i know, it's almost impossible to succeed...... but who cares really?
  ans:
  - the answer must be in the attempt.

- que:
  - where is the waitress?
  ans:
  - in new york, she'd be out of a job.

- que:
  - you wanna talk in english, for laughs?
  ans:
  - yeah, okay.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - probably.

- que:
  - he's from there?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - why'd you get off?
  ans:
  - well, he convinced me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yeah, we kissed.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i've known you a long time.

- que:
  - you gonna see him again?
  ans:
  - we haven't talked about that yet.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - hey, frank.

- que:
  - how you been?
  ans:
  - i'm glad you're home.

- que:
  - so how was madrid?
  ans:
  - madrid sucked.

- que:
  - i told you, no?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - so are you okay now?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?
  ans:
  - well, she was literally a botticelli angel...... telling me everything would be okay.

- que:
  - how did you meet?
  ans:
  - on the train.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - us men are so stupid.

- que:
  - don't they?
  ans:
  - i feel like this is some dream world we're in.

- que:
  - but then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - but don't you think that's what...... makes our time and specific moments so important?
  ans:
  - yeah, i know.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - actually, i don't know.

- que:
  - you'd hate to fly, right?
  ans:
  - i'm not so scared of flying.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no, let's just be rational adults about this.

- que:
  - it's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?
  ans:
  - people exchange numbers, addresses.

- que:
  - yeah, why?
  ans:
  - it's stupid.

- que:
  - it's the only way, no?
  ans:
  - well, all right.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's just...

- que:
  - it's depressing, no?
  ans:
  - now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...... when we'll have to say goodbye.

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - say goodbye.

- que:
  - you think you can do that?
  ans:
  - no problem.

- que:
  - do you speak english?
  ans:
  - a bit.

- que:
  - a bit?
  ans:
  - i'm having kind of an odd situation...... which is that...

- que:

  ans:
  - it's the law.

  - he won't be out there long.
  ans:
  - and ann mary deacon, what about her rights?

  - that's got to be him.
  ans:
  - you sure you want the rest of it?

  ans:
  - my wife's brother.

  - it's nothing.

- que:
  - what size would you like?

- que:
  - we're done, right?
  ans:

- que:

- que:

- que:

- que:
  - and you know what?

  - i feel fucking sadness about that.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - they're fine.

- que:
  - you don't like my fingernails now?
  ans:
  - and those balanced more toward the feminine check them that way.

- que:
  - are you gay?
  ans:
  - yeah, i'm fucking sure.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you need a woman.

- que:
  - where you going?
  ans:
  - it's turkey time.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - now, you talk the talk... you know i'm expecting you to walk the walk.

- que:
  - what'd you say?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - every relationship has a bull and a cow?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - louis, what's going on?
  ans:
  - and don't bring the thing.

- que:
  - the what?
  ans:
  - the thing.

- que:
  - what thing?
  ans:
  - the thing.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - yeah, i understand.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's louis.

- que:
  - see this?
  ans:
  - some cookies in there.

- que:
  - when are you coming back?
  ans:
  - soon.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i'm not hungry, though.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - don't go nowhere.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - about making it with a guy?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - clean?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - we have a visitor from new york.

- que:
  - i got to fight it, right?
  ans:
  - i mean, i can't go to jail.

- que:
  - louis, am i right?
  ans:
  - you are right.

- que:
  - did you know... that apparently some people... do not regard the thumb, technically, to be a finger?
  ans:
  - curious for myself, i turned to louis here... who with his newfound dictionary skills looked it up for me.

- que:
  - you know what it said?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - louis.

- que:
  - besides, you think something like this is necessary... anyway, to intimidate people?
  ans:
  - i say intimidation comes from within.

- que:
  - but you know what's the most intimidating quality?
  ans:
  - not that you asked.

- que:
  - but the absolutely most intimidating in my opinion?
  ans:
  - when an individual just doesn't give a shit.

- que:
  - and i am very concerned... about the way things have turned out here.
  ans:
  - louis, you want to go to medical school?

- que:
  - the bleeding?
  ans:
  - no, not him.

- que:
  - fine?
  ans:
  - it was all right.

- que:
  - what were you thinking?
  ans:
  - you were gonna extort a federal prosecutor.

- que:
  - and whether you wanna call a thumb... a finger or a digit... for the sake of this discussion, it doesn't really matter.
  ans:
  - you didn't think all hell wouldn't break loose?

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:
  - because whatever you choose to call it... a thumb... has a fingerprint... and the one you sent... had the wrong fucking one.

- que:
  - how long could we have kept below radar... with a thumbless, bleeding half wit?
  ans:
  - you see, sometimes... one has to use their professional prerogative... to override a dumb request.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - we'll take brian back to where you found him and get out of here.

- que:
  - are we going to the baywatch now?
  ans:
  - no, we can't go to the baywatch now.

- que:
  - you got a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - no, i don't.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - let me tell you something.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - it's that the thing you're most afraid of in life... if you do it, if you step up, good things will happen.

- que:
  - hi, how are you today?
  ans:
  - nice weather we're having.

- que:
  - can we please finish pairing up, everyone?
  ans:
