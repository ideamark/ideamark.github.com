- que:
  - Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
  ans:
  - A raft.

- que:
  - No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
  ans:
  - He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.

- que:
  - You thinking what I'm thinking?
  ans:
  - You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.

- que:
  - Do you know what this means?
  ans:
  - Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.

- que:
  - What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
  ans:
  - Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.

- que:
  - What? What did we do?
  ans:
  - We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.

- que:
  - Ready Lloyd?
  ans:
  - LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.

- que:
  - I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
  ans:
  - Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?

- que:
  - Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Okay. Which one do you want?
  ans:
  - The one on the left.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You take her.

- que:
  - Hey, where'd you go?
  ans:
  - Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.

- que:
  - So can I come along?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you wearing a coconut bra?
  ans:
  - Oh, you're good.

- que:
  - You mean the lunch room?
  ans:
  - I thought I told you to get lost.

- que:
  - Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
  ans:
  - Not to expect you tonight.

- que:
  - TURK, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Special Needs class.

- que:
  - Why ith dat newth?
  ans:
  - This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.

- que:
  - Yes, what?
  ans:
  - Don't answer me. Say what I say.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Checking up on my friend, Harry.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know, \"some\". The fag stuff.

- que:
  - So could you get us into the principal's office?
  ans:
  - Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.

- que:
  - Tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - Oh, baby, you're the bestest.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Let's just do it and get out of here.

- que:
  - That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
  ans:
  - No, it was a complete waste of time.

- que:
  - Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.

- que:
  - LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
  ans:
  - HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.

- que:
  - Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
  ans:
  - You were born free and free you should remain.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - Duh. I'm in your class at school.

- que:
  - Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
  ans:
  - I don't know if you'd call us \"friends\"...

- que:
  - Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
  ans:
  - Skateboard.

- que:
  - How much homework is there?
  ans:
  - That's the downside. There is none.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
  ans:
  - You can bring whatever you want, little friend.

- que:
  - Do we have a deal?
  ans:
  - KID Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.

- que:
  - Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
  ans:
  - He passed away three years ago.

- que:
  - Hey can be on top?
  ans:
  - Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, give it to me.
  ans:
  - Have you got what I want?

- que:
  - How was that?
  ans:
  - It's too close to call. Okay next contest, now lets...

- que:
  - Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
  ans:
  - LLOYD, may I see you a minute?

- que:
  - Will that be on the midterm?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Obviously.
  ans:
  - That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?

- que:
  - I think you did it.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure if I can do this.

- que:
  - We start our own class?
  ans:
  - Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.

- que:
  - So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
  ans:
  - To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?

- que:
  - And...?
  ans:
  - And, take some more pictures.

- que:
  - Who's there?
  ans:
  - Guess what\"s under these coconuts.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's a surprise.

- que:
  - You got the Extender?
  ans:
  - Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.

- que:
  - So what do you keep in there?
  ans:
  - Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.

- que:
  - Everything?
  ans:
  - Everything. Just for the record.

- que:
  - Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
  ans:
  - The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.

- que:
  - What papers?
  ans:
  - The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.

- que:
  - JESSICA. Are you sure?
  ans:
  - She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.

- que:
  - Are you going to kill her?
  ans:
  - Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.

- que:
  - Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
  ans:
  - I sold all the wind instruments. Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?

- que:
  - This is horse?
  ans:
  - No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.

- que:
  - What does Leto say, Piter?
  ans:
  - I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.

- que:
  - What's that you're saying?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.

- que:
  - Yes?... How was your journey?
  ans:
  - Many machines on Ix... new machines.

- que:
  - Is this what you seek?
  ans:
  - Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.

- que:
  - Would you really have drawn my blood?
  ans:
  - If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.

- que:
  - Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
  ans:
  - My Lord?

- que:
  - Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
  ans:
  - No, but many consider my training valuable.

- que:
  - You know the ancient tongues?
  ans:
  - I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.

- que:
  - Do you know this my lady?
  ans:
  - It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.

- que:
  - What does she fear? What about my Father?
  ans:
  - Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

- que:
  - Where are we do you think?
  ans:
  - The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock...

- que:
  - I can't... I can't.
  ans:
  - Is he....?

- que:
  - Cinnamon... the spice! Do you smell it?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - What's happened?... Why did it leave?
  ans:
  - Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone.

- que:
  - Are you a Fremen?
  ans:
  - I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.

- que:
  - You've worn a stillsuit before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
  ans:
  - No one. It... seemed the proper way.

- que:
  - Will we see a worm?
  ans:
  - Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.

- que:
  - Always?
  ans:
  - Always.

- que:
  - Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him. May his passage cleanse the world.
  ans:
  - Why do they come?

- que:
  - You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch! Watch!
  ans:
  - Liet?

- que:
  - What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
  ans:
  - We call that one Muad'dib.

- que:
  - Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
  ans:
  - You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.... We welcome you.

- que:
  - My own name is a killing word. Will it be a healing word as well?
  ans:
  - Pain.

- que:
  - Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
  ans:
  - It burns.

- que:
  - Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
  ans:
  - You feel the flesh crisping?

- que:
  - Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
  ans:
  - Not all of them... I know which ones will.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.

- que:
  - ... Many men have tried.
  ans:
  - Did they try and fail?

- que:
  - Did they try and fail?
  ans:
  - They tried and died.

- que:
  - My father sent you to test me. Music then?
  ans:
  - Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

- que:
  - I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
  ans:
  - No. I never drink -- wine.

- que:
  - Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi?
  ans:
  - I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.

- que:
  - Who are you? What do you want?
  ans:
  - Because I'm planning on dying soon.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.

- que:
  - Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life. When is your next picture coming out?
  ans:
  - I have no next picture.

- que:
  - The women?
  ans:
  - Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.

- que:
  - Hey Bela, how do you do that?
  ans:
  - You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes.

- que:
  - Do you want me to get it for you?
  ans:
  - No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright.

- que:
  - Are you sure this is okay?
  ans:
  - Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.

- que:
  - That's good. I could use the money.
  ans:
  - But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?

- que:
  - Dracula?
  ans:
  - No! Doctor Acula! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count.

- que:
  - Should I call a doctor?
  ans:
  - Nah. This happens all the time...

- que:
  - Is there anything I can get you? Water? A blanket?
  ans:
  - Goulash.

- que:
  - What's in the needle?
  ans:
  - We didn't make a dime.

- que:
  - Mmph? Where am I?
  ans:
  - You're shooting \"Bride Of The Atom.\" Scene 85.

- que:
  - What is this place?
  ans:
  - This is the Philosophical Research Society. A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.

- que:
  - Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
  ans:
  - Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.

- que:
  - So why didn't you do it?
  ans:
  - But maybe not.

- que:
  - Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go?
  ans:
  - You'll be fighting with the octopus.

- que:
  - Out there?! What happened to the stream?
  ans:
  - This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.

- que:
  - Okay! How do we turn this thing on?
  ans:
  - Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I was thinking about killing myself.

- que:
  - Don't you have any savings?
  ans:
  - I'm obsolete. I have nothing to live for. Tonight, I should die. And you should come with me.

- que:
  - Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?
  ans:
  - Formaldehyde.

- que:
  - Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
  ans:
  - Soon, Bela... Soon.

- que:
  - So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
  ans:
  - No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.

- que:
  - Oh. So what is the scene about?
  ans:
  - Uh... you're a very important and respected man. You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.

- que:
  - Okay. But what if I'm not in too big a hurry? What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life? To smell a flower?
  ans:
  - That's great. Let's do a take.

- que:
  - Eddie, how was I?
  ans:
  - Perfect.

- que:
  - Has anyone ever been to Downey?
  ans:
  - Last night was quite a romp.

- que:
  - Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
  ans:
  - I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.

- que:
  - You mean a Tesla coil?
  ans:
  - Absolutely! It's just the beginning. I promise this, If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.

- que:
  - What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
  ans:
  - Nothin'! I told him he was great.

- que:
  - And who may you be?
  ans:
  - Edward Wood, Sir.

- que:
  - Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970? How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
  ans:
  - I guessed.

- que:
  - It's that easy?
  ans:
  - Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all about razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.

- que:
  - Incidentally, you promise you're not going to scratch my car...?
  ans:
  - I told you, the octopus is made of rubber. This is a piece o' cake.

- que:
  - Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It seems a little crazy, but sometimes you just know. She's perfect for me.

- que:
  - Will he be okay?
  ans:
  - We'll do our best.

- que:
  - Isn't he?
  ans:
  - No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago.

- que:
  - Honey, what if I'm wrong? What if I just don't have it?
  ans:
  - Ed, it was only one review.

- que:
  - Eddie, I don't understand. Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
  ans:
  - Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.

- que:
  - So did you get his autograph?
  ans:
  - Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as soon as I get home.

- que:
  - How long have you been doing this?
  ans:
  - Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.

- que:
  - How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
  ans:
  - Hon', nobody's bothered but you. Look around -- they couldn't care less.

- que:
  - Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
  ans:
  - Toss us out on our ass.

- que:
  - That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer?
  ans:
  - Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry? I blew it! I thought she was rich.

- que:
  - Does she have room for me?
  ans:
  - Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.

- que:
  - I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. Say, who's the lug?
  ans:
  - That's Tony McCoy. He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.

- que:
  - Oh really? How much money did he put up?
  ans:
  - None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.

- que:
  - Eddie, what's my motivation?
  ans:
  - Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.

- que:
  - But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
  ans:
  - Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie. Quit kidding around.

- que:
  - Did you really mean those things you said..?
  ans:
  - I'm tired of living on the fringe.

- que:
  - I understand you just moved here?
  ans:
  - Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting.

- que:
  - Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
  ans:
  - For this one, we need $60,000.

- que:
  - Hmm. Those sound kind of small. Oh, here's one that looks good, Janet Lawton. I'd sure like to play her.
  ans:
  - Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?

- que:
  - I don't know. Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
  ans:
  - Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.

- que:
  - Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
  ans:
  - Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?

- que:
  - What other sixty-thousand?
  ans:
  - The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.

- que:
  - Wood? Ward? Wood. Hey, what do you know. It is Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one. Right?
  ans:
  - So what are you bringing me? Looks like you got some film cans.

- que:
  - Yeah...?
  ans:
  - Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.

- que:
  - Oh! Our church has the money for one film. We just don't have it for all twelve...
  ans:
  - Hmm, so you're in the picture business?

- que:
  - Absolutely! You see this script..?
  ans:
  - \"Graverobbers From Outer Space\"! It's money in the bank.

- que:
  - Graverobbers from what?
  ans:
  - From outer space! It's science- fiction. Very pay my back rent from the profits.

- que:
  - Da pleasure be mine.
  ans:
  - Oh, you wanna talk about the \"big picture\"?! How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night?

- que:
  - Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
  ans:
  - Mm, not good-lookink enough.

- que:
  - I like. When do movie shoot?
  ans:
  - Hopefully, very soon. I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.

- que:
  - Really? Was the third act too intense?
  ans:
  - No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.

- que:
  - Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.

- que:
  - Is there a script?
  ans:
  - Fuck no! But there's a poster.

- que:
  - Are you a fruit?
  ans:
  - No, no, not at all! I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.

- que:
  - So you're not a fruit?
  ans:
  - Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in WW2. 'Course, I was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.

- que:
  - Isn't he dead?
  ans:
  - No, he's not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.

- que:
  - OUR picture?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah. Our picture.

- que:
  - Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
  ans:
  - Because he's my friend.

- que:
  - Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
  ans:
  - Maybe it needs special handling.

- que:
  - What are you making?
  ans:
  - Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.

- que:
  - How long's he been here?
  ans:
  - This is my thirteenth pair.

- que:
  - He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
  ans:
  - Not good...

- que:
  - So have you always lived in L.A.?
  ans:
  - Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.

- que:
  - Did you find it boring?
  ans:
  - Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines. And I listened to the radio dramas...

- que:
  - A few years ago, I actually saw him do \"Dracula\" live. I thought he was much scarier in person.
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
  ans:
  - No! I love sex with girls.

- que:
  - Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
  ans:
  - Okay?

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - The sun.

- que:
  - I don't understand. Do you want my autograph?
  ans:
  - No. I think my film is perfect for you.

- que:
  - It's uncanny.
  ans:
  - Look... would it be possible to make the \"Ghoul's Wife\" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?

- que:
  - So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
  ans:
  - What's uncanny?

- que:
  - The set doesn't look right! It looks too... empty. Clutter it up. Put a skeleton in the corner. And what's that thing over there?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Wow, this lab looks great. Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
  ans:
  - We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.

- que:
  - Nah, it'll work. Where's Bela?
  ans:
  - Ed, you said you were getting permission.

- que:
  - So how long have you known Eddie?
  ans:
  - Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.

- que:
  - ...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
  ans:
  - I suppose. It's very expensive.

- que:
  - What are you, an angora wholesaler?
  ans:
  - No, I work in pictures. I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.

- que:
  - You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
  ans:
  - Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.

- que:
  - ME?! No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
  ans:
  - Who?

- que:
  - No, no! I like girls. So how 'bout Friday?
  ans:
  - No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.

- que:
  - At what point?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I brought you some movies.

- que:
  - Anything good?
  ans:
  - No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.

- que:
  - What do you love her or something?
  ans:
  - Come on...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...

  - Yeah, so... ?
  ans:
  - They celebrated the common person.

- que:
  - Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
  ans:
  - How's your mother?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.

- que:
  - You think she really likes him?
  ans:
  - She doesn't give a shit about him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.

- que:
  - Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
  ans:
  - Ed, can I see you a second.

- que:
  - Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
  ans:
  - What if Shari's the dream?

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I've got this great idea. We put together a video. \"The Network Executives Goofiest Moments.\" And listen, i've really loved working here.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.

- que:
  - Thank you. Can I see her?
  ans:
  - I ... don't know. I ...

  - No. The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
  ans:
  - Who?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...

- que:
  - You know who we are?
  ans:
  - Tell me.

- que:
  - Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Aah, I wanted Shari to come.

- que:
  - Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Honey, if you're watching this is for you.

- que:
  - Eddie? ...
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Are the TV people with you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. The camera guy is here.

- que:
  - Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
  ans:
  - No. It's a mess.

- que:
  - I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
  ans:
  - No. Maybe he's watching. Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.

- que:
  - How's Marcia? She all right?
  ans:
  - I don't know. She's living with that \"entertainer\"...

- que:
  - Yes to me or yes to the coil?
  ans:
  - Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.

- que:
  - But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
  ans:
  - She could've been a nurse.

- que:
  - Could've been a nurse?
  ans:
  - She had white shoes.

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...

- que:
  - Mom?
  ans:
  - I'm at the hospital.

- que:
  - Oh God. What hospital?
  ans:
  - St. Joseph's.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - It was horrible. He called me up.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The doctor said you were having sex.

- que:
  - Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
  ans:
  - Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.

- que:
  - No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is she, at work?
  ans:
  - She left.

- que:
  - Well, when will she be back?
  ans:
  - She won't.

- que:
  - Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
  ans:
  - No, I mean...

- que:
  - What does this mean?
  ans:
  - Never would be plenty.

- que:
  - You batted or you bunted?
  ans:
  - Hey, Lou.

- que:
  - Are you sure about this?
  ans:
  - Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.

- que:
  - Cream rinse?
  ans:
  - Dynamite.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So maybe this is my dynamite.

- que:
  - Oh... how come?
  ans:
  - I mean bad.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Oh God, this is so weird.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I missed you.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.

- que:
  - It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
  ans:
  - Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He could give me some oxygen.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.

- que:
  - ...if this ... ... weren't here... ?
  ans:
  - ... yeah, then, but...

- que:
  - So...?
  ans:
  - Look at this.

- que:
  - Ed?
  ans:
  - I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Somewhere.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.

- que:
  - ...yeah?
  ans:
  - No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Everybody's someone.

- que:
  - What did you do to your hair?
  ans:
  - My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.

- que:
  - What are you drunk?
  ans:
  - What is?!

- que:
  - You're in show business?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I service video equipment.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm doing all right.

- que:
  - You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the \"Ernest\" movies?
  ans:
  - Screw off.

- que:
  - How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - No. What happened?
  ans:
  - That's our sister. She's got a new boyfriend.

- que:
  - Marcia's living with a singer?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.

- que:
  - Oh, Jesus.
  ans:
  - I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?

- que:
  - While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
  ans:
  - Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's me, Ed.

- que:
  - You watching the ballgame?
  ans:
  - Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.

- que:
  - Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
  ans:
  - Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.

- que:
  - ... Ray?
  ans:
  - I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.

- que:
  - Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
  ans:
  - Hi, Shari.

- que:
  - Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
  ans:
  - Who's Shari?

- que:
  - No problema. You want a picture?
  ans:
  - No -- keep it.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's Ed.

- que:
  - It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
  ans:
  - I was in jail.

- que:
  - The whole time? Eighteen years?
  ans:
  - No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.

- que:
  - What?... Why?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - Are you busy tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Can I help with anything?
  ans:
  - No. It's going to be about a half-hour.

- que:
  - Good?
  ans:
  - Mm.

- que:
  - What happened? You described this \"crazy-kooky\" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
  ans:
  - We don't have foibles.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.

- que:
  - What does that have to do with... ?
  ans:
  - If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.

- que:
  - What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
  ans:
  - Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.

- que:
  - In love?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's serious. I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.

- que:
  - What kind of person?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Anything wrong?
  ans:
  - Everything's fine. Just, you know, school.

- que:
  - How'd it go?
  ans:
  - Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.

- que:
  - You guys have fun?
  ans:
  - Yeah. No. I mean, you know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.

- que:
  - Having a problem with your eye there?
  ans:
  - I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.

- que:
  - Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
  ans:
  - You're kidding, right?

- que:
  - Mr. M.?
  ans:
  - Huh. Okay. Well, I guess I'd better do my count.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I think we've got a problem.

- que:
  - Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
  ans:
  - You know what they say about the early bird.

- que:
  - Okay. But we're still missing something key here. What are we missing?
  ans:
  - I know.

- que:
  - 6,30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
  ans:
  - Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we \"interrogate?\"

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium. Be modest. Thank them for this incredible honor.

- que:
  - So what brings you here?
  ans:
  - I'm looking at new cars.

- que:
  - Huh. Right. College. Wow. Where are you going? Where 'd you get into?
  ans:
  - Sporty.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - Anywhere you want. Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.

- que:
  - Handles pretty good, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Coming to see me. Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
  ans:
  - Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - My house.

- que:
  - Would you sign it for me?
  ans:
  - What a surprise.

- que:
  - Jim, where the hell have you been?
  ans:
  - Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - Walt needs to see you.

- que:
  - You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
  ans:
  - Just wait outside. Tammy.

- que:
  - Okay. But is this about the posters?
  ans:
  - Possibly. Please just wait outside.

- que:
  - What is it. Tammy?
  ans:
  - I'm the one. I did it. I tore down Paul's posters.

- que:
  - And when did you do it?
  ans:
  - This weekend.

- que:
  - Exactly when?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Yesterday. Sunday.

- que:
  - And how did you get in the school?
  ans:
  - Door was open.

- que:
  - After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
  ans:
  - Which door?

- que:
  - Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
  ans:
  - Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?

- que:
  - Here?
  ans:
  - More this way.

- que:
  - Should we get a what?
  ans:
  - points at the motel.

- que:
  - Shall we give it a name?
  ans:
  - Dave.

- que:
  - All his life. He's tried everything.
  ans:
  - Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?

- que:
  - Still clear?
  ans:
  - Take me to that motel. Like you wanted.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.

- que:
  - What do you want, Jim?
  ans:
  - You're there.

- que:
  - And she's super-nice
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
  ans:
  - Paul, what's your favorite fruit?

- que:
  - And 290 \"disregards,\" right?
  ans:
  - I'm not like you.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - People can see this.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - These are private -- these are for us.

- que:
  - We can't both run, can we? We're brother and sister. Can we?
  ans:
  - I mean at you.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - I don't know. You're her brother you should know.

- que:
  - Okay, Mr. Popular. You're on.
  ans:
  - Who put you up to this?

- que:
  - Way to go, Tracy! Isn't this exciting?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
  ans:
  - Sure, Tracy.

- que:
  - Yes, Paul?
  ans:
  - Have a great summer. And good luck at college.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Oh. Hi, Tammy. I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.

- que:
  - Now could you leave me alone?
  ans:
  - Sure, Paul. No hard feelings.

- que:
  - What's it to you?
  ans:
  - I saw you fight Kid Gavilan. I like your style.

- que:
  - What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
  ans:
  - You got a brother up in Folsom. I know because I put him there.

- que:
  - You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
  ans:
  - You wanna buy your brother ten years...? You don't have to say anything. Just look at this list and point. Here.

- que:
  - That obvious, huh?
  ans:
  - It's practically stamped on your forehead.

- que:
  - Somebody hit you?
  ans:
  - It's not what you think.

- que:
  - Can I get you a drink?
  ans:
  - Yeah, plain scotch.

- que:
  - No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
  ans:
  - You use words like that, you might make me mad.

- que:
  - Yes. But do you know?
  ans:
  - Yeah I know. Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side. He doesn't want any attention.

- que:
  - Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.

- que:
  - Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
  ans:
  - Like I said we were friendly, not friends.

- que:
  - How'd she meet Patchett?
  ans:
  - Tell me about Patchett.

- que:
  - You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
  ans:
  - It's Lynn.

- que:
  - I remember you from Christmas Eve. You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

- que:
  - There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Do you enjoy it?
  ans:
  - When they deserve it.

- que:
  - Did they deserve it today?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
  ans:
  - No. I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me. And that's all the news that's fit to print.

- que:
  - Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - It doesn't matter. All they get is Veronica Lake. You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... Where'd this come from?
  ans:
  - When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother. I guess I got in the way.

- que:
  - Do you like being a cop, Bud?
  ans:
  - I used to. What I do now is strong-arm. Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it. If I could work Homicide like a real detective...

- que:
  - Did you talk to Exley?
  ans:
  - Come in out of the rain. In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.

- que:
  - How'd you get to know so much about him?
  ans:
  - Come in out of the rain, Bud.

- que:
  - You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
  ans:
  - We talked.

- que:
  - This business, Captain?
  ans:
  - Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.

- que:
  - Does that paper say we've been indicted? Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
  ans:
  - He made his play amd he got what he wanted. They're making him a detective.

- que:
  - Captain, what do you want?
  ans:
  - Call me Dudley.

- que:
  - Dudley, what do you want?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I hate them.

- que:
  - It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him. Why the loyalty, Wendell?
  ans:
  - Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.

- que:
  - Doing what? Mowing your fucking lawn?
  ans:
  - They're yours. Take them.

- que:
  - I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
  ans:
  - Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.

- que:
  - How'd you get them to retract?
  ans:
  - Give me one minute.

- que:
  - What work?
  ans:
  - You lost me, Dudley. I don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - You know him?
  ans:
  - Seen him around. He used to be a cop.

- que:
  - Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory. Want to grab a beer?
  ans:
  - Rain check me, partner. I got something big going on tonight.

- que:
  - What? That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
  ans:
  - No. I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it. But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D. I'd like to ask a couple of questions.

- que:
  - What was that boyfriend's name?
  ans:
  - We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day. She called him by a nickname. Muns or Lunts or something.

- que:
  - Stens? Was it Stens?
  ans:
  - Maybe. I don't know.

- que:
  - Easy. Tell me about the ruckus.
  ans:
  - You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. Was it outside, inside?

- que:
  - Was it... a rat?
  ans:
  - Yeah. A great big one.

- que:
  - It's a surprise. You like surprises, don't you, White?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's Stens.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.

- que:
  - A naked guy with a gun? You expect anyone to believe that?
  ans:
  - Get the fuck away from me.

- que:
  - How's it going to look on your report?
  ans:
  - It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. Justice.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Lynn.

- que:
  - Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to?
  ans:
  - The Nite Owl! Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.

- que:
  - It wasn't the Negroes. The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
  ans:
  - Dudley.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Stay smart, Bud. We build a case. We play by the rules.

- que:
  - With a wrecking ball. You want to help me swing it?
  ans:
  - Let's go see Pierce Patchett. Run a good-cop-bad-cop.

- que:
  - You expecting problems?
  ans:
  - Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.

- que:
  - You wanted to meet here?
  ans:
  - Me? You called it. I got a message that...

- que:
  - You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
  ans:
  - A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.

- que:
  - Are you Pierce Patchett?
  ans:
  - I am. Are you soliciting for police charities? The last time, you people called at my office.

- que:
  - I was here, hosting a party. Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
  ans:
  - Richard Stensland.

- que:
  - You know I do or you wouldn't be here. How did you find me?
  ans:
  - We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve. This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

- que:
  - Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
  ans:
  - I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket. She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.

- que:
  - Wait. Our deal still holds?
  ans:
  - I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.

- que:
  - What little studio?
  ans:
  - That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.

- que:
  - Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
  ans:
  - Officer White. I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.

- que:
  - Wendell White, how's tricks, paesano?
  ans:
  - I ain't your paesano, you wop cocksucker.

- que:
  - What do you want, officer?
  ans:
  - You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks? He works for a guy named Patchett.

- que:
  - Should I?
  ans:
  - His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill.

- que:
  - How 'bout I give you your balls back?
  ans:
  - Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.

- que:
  - Bullshit. Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
  ans:
  - Deuce Perkins. Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant. The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.

- que:
  - Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
  ans:
  - I got a few Nite Owl questions.

- que:
  - What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - Anything off. Anything that didn't make sense.

- que:
  - Whose shoe?
  ans:
  - Susan Lefferts.

- que:
  - If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way. What are these smears in the blood?
  ans:
  - It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.

- que:
  - Dick Stensland. Had to be dumb panic. If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
  ans:
  - Cotton balls. I found them just inside the meat locker door.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...

- que:
  - Ed, your observations have been astute. What's your assessment of this situation?
  ans:
  - I want to know who we give the public in contrast? The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire.

- que:
  - Clean?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
  ans:
  - Say what and so what.

- que:
  - That fucking Larry. I almost believed him.
  ans:
  - Did one of the officers work you over a little?

- que:
  - Nothing, Ray. That Larry, he's a pisser. You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Man, why're you talkin' about Larry? His business is his business.

- que:
  - Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
  ans:
  - You ain't woofin' I did. Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.

- que:
  - Man, what're you saying?
  ans:
  - Ray, we got the shotguns.

- que:
  - Say what?
  ans:
  - I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.

- que:
  - Were you on hop? You were passed out when you got arrested. Were you hopped up, Ray?
  ans:
  - Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.

- que:
  - I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who! Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
  ans:
  - Nobody. At least not yet.

- que:
  - And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
  ans:
  - Gone. Not a trace.

- que:
  - It's for your own safety. Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
  ans:
  - Trashcan Jack. The Big V. I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.

- que:
  - Alright. We'll drop that line for now. Next topic. Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
  ans:
  - But you were business associates?

- que:
  - And what?
  ans:
  - Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.

- que:
  - The youngest applicant by eight years.
  ans:
  - And?

- que:
  - You'll make lieutenant inside a year. Patrol division?
  ans:
  - I was thinking Detective Bureau.

- que:
  - Am I...? Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
  ans:
  - Dudley, we've been over this.

- que:
  - Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
  ans:
  - Yes, Dudley. I am.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We got a call earlier on three Negro youths. Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.

- que:
  - No... Where'd the tip come from?
  ans:
  - Anonymous. Probably nothing.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - And now you'll provide them.

- que:
  - Why not, lad? Absolute justice?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Really? Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
  ans:
  - John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath. Don't start now.

- que:
  - You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
  ans:
  - I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.

- que:
  - What's this all about, lad?
  ans:
  - Part of it has to do with a murder. I've been working with Ed Exley on it.

- que:
  - You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
  ans:
  - It's a private investigation. I fucked something up and I want to make amends.

- que:
  - Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're the key witness?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Yeah, Exley. What's the payoff?
  ans:
  - You're the payoff expert. I'm just doing my duty.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week. Next to you I'm clean. And smart.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Glasses.

- que:
  - Damnit... What?
  ans:
  - I want you to follow Bud White.

- que:
  - Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night?
  ans:
  - Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone.

- que:
  - You make a mistake?
  ans:
  - Yeah. My whole life.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's a simple question.

- que:
  - So what's the point?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one.

- que:
  - What's that for?
  ans:
  - Bud White. He sees us and we're dead.

- que:
  - Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - Movie star hookers. Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.

- que:
  - What's Fleur-de-Lis?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But first I want to brace Stompanato.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She is Lana Turner.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to Lynn Bracken's. I'll meet you at the Dining Car.

- que:
  - What's on the call sheet?
  ans:
  - A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz. Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.

- que:
  - Decorated?
  ans:
  - With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.

- que:
  - Of his penis, sir?
  ans:
  - We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps. All of them reloading twice.

- que:
  - The Nite Owl. Anything bothering you about the case?
  ans:
  - Yeah. The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Bud White grilled me on it this morning. You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.

- que:
  - Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
  ans:
  - A vulgar term, but yes.

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - Lynn Bracken.

- que:
  - Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Really? What did White say?
  ans:
  - He said you were smart. He also said you were competing with your dead father. How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It galls you that I know so much about you. You don't have information to compete.

- que:
  - How was I?
  ans:
  - Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.

- que:
  - I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
  ans:
  - I see Bud because I want to. I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.

- que:
  - Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
  ans:
  - I don't hate White. I really don't. It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.

- que:
  - You cut to the heart of things, don't you? What about Lynn Bracken? She going to be a hooker all her life?
  ans:
  - I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.

- que:
  - Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
  ans:
  - You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.

- que:
  - You, me and White, huh?
  ans:
  - Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.

- que:
  - Forget everything else for a second, Lynn. Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
  ans:
  - A police captain. I think he's behind all of this.

- que:
  - Where will you go?
  ans:
  - Bisbee, Arizona. The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Right now, before I back down.

- que:
  - Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
  ans:
  - Some men get the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.

- que:
  - On what evidence?
  ans:
  - The proof had his throat slit. So far you're not denying it.

- que:
  - What's Dudley's scheme?
  ans:
  - It seems like my Susan, but...

- que:
  - When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
  ans:
  - At Christmas. We had fought. I didn't like her boyfriend. I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.

- que:
  - Officer White?
  ans:
  - A sweet man.

- que:
  - Big V Jack Vincennes! May I have this dance?
  ans:
  - Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine.

- que:
  - You lost me, Sid. Who?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's subtle.

- que:
  - Something good?
  ans:
  - Not a word.

- que:
  - Sid, how are they hanging?
  ans:
  - Down around my ankles.

- que:
  - You tight with the D.A., trash?
  ans:
  - Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.

- que:
  - Where'd you hear that?
  ans:
  - Around.

- que:
  - What happened with the kid and Loew?
  ans:
  - You didn't get my message? It got called off. The kid chickened out at the last minute.

- que:
  - Loew didn't go with him. You're sure?
  ans:
  - I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.

- que:
  - Have we met before?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Was it a party?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
  ans:
  - Oh, I know. A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

- que:
  - Really? How?
  ans:
  - You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.

- que:
  - And no one'll know about this?
  ans:
  - It'll be our secret.

- que:
  - Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Cap. Back in Narcotics.

- que:
  - Oh? Anyplace else?
  ans:
  - Working whores with squad two.

- que:
  - Brill?
  ans:
  - Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field. My name doesn't matter.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - DePinto's dead.

- que:
  - They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
  ans:
  - I don't know anything about Zavitz.

- que:
  - What'd he say to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What'd he give to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.

- que:
  - Someone else?
  ans:
  - Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.

- que:
  - So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
  ans:
  - I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.

- que:
  - You've got it on tape?
  ans:
  - Clear as day.

- que:
  - Who else have you told?
  ans:
  - No one. But I'm a little nervous.

- que:
  - When can you get it here?
  ans:
  - I'm doing a transfer now.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - Tell us about Rachel Banks.

- que:
  - What kind of a question is that?
  ans:
  - A direct one.

- que:
  - Told by whom?
  ans:
  - Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who was that other guy?
  ans:
  - One of many people who would live a word with you.

- que:
  - What do they have to do with this?
  ans:
  - That's who they are.

- que:
  - The NSA?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - It's a SAT-tracker.

- que:
  - Why are they after me?
  ans:
  - If I knew, they'd be after me. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.

- que:
  - Wait. What do I do?
  ans:
  - Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.

- que:
  - Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
  ans:
  - They're spooks.

- que:
  - How many years have you been hiding from them? How many years have you been running? What'd they do to you?
  ans:
  - If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury. And take this.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I didn't use my name.

- que:
  - What'd I tell you?
  ans:
  - You told me no calls.

- que:
  - How do you know so much?
  ans:
  - None of your business.

- que:
  - You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
  ans:
  - I was a traffic analyst.

- que:
  - How'd you get around the tap orders?
  ans:
  - How'd you have the manpower to--

- que:
  - Why'd you leave?
  ans:
  - It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split.

- que:
  - They come after you?
  ans:
  - Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Looks like Detroit.

- que:
  - It really is. Did you find anything?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Take a walk with me.

- que:
  - Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Jesus. Do you have proof?
  ans:
  - Well, actually, you have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - They're here.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Them.

- que:
  - Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
  ans:
  - Where?

- que:
  - Gimme that.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - You're driving.

- que:
  - Think we let out enough air?
  ans:
  - Oh my God...

- que:
  - We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
  ans:
  - Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?

- que:
  - So what do we do now?
  ans:
  - I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.

- que:
  - What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
  ans:
  - The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be looking for those moves.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.

- que:
  - You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
  ans:
  - No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.

- que:
  - How fast can you learn?
  ans:
  - Pretty fast.

- que:
  - Shit.
  ans:
  - What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?

- que:
  - What are you dialing?
  ans:
  - He came in four minutes ago.

- que:
  - Feeling lucky?
  ans:
  - Not particularly, no.

- que:
  - Who's calling?
  ans:
  - It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.

- que:
  - --Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
  ans:
  - A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.

- que:
  - Well then who can?
  ans:
  - Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.

- que:
  - Law enforcement?
  ans:
  - FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.

- que:
  - Are you sure about this?
  ans:
  - I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.

- que:
  - With what?
  ans:
  - With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...

- que:
  - You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
  ans:
  - Is it okay?

- que:
  - Do you see anything you like?
  ans:
  - I'm married.

- que:
  - Is that good?
  ans:
  - Very good.

- que:
  - What size?
  ans:
  - Eight. Size eight.

- que:
  - Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
  ans:
  - Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.

- que:
  - Thanks. Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.

- que:
  - Your stuff?
  ans:
  - The robbery.

- que:
  - A report?
  ans:
  - A police report.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About the accident.

- que:
  - Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
  ans:
  - Somebody took my blender.

- que:
  - Did he give you anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Anything at all?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Was he with anyone?
  ans:
  - Not that I could see.

- que:
  - Nobody gave you anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why'd you go to Harrison's?
  ans:
  - To buy lingerie.

- que:
  - For your wife?
  ans:
  - Yes, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.

- que:
  - I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, way outa line. You understand?
  ans:
  - Just for the criminals.

- que:
  - You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
  ans:
  - Something bad happened tonight.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I saw a man die.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.

- que:
  - What'd you buy at Harrison's?
  ans:
  - A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.

- que:
  - Bobby?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
  ans:
  - How'd you get the information on DePinto?

- que:
  - Have you been working with Rachel?
  ans:
  - There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.

- que:
  - Stacy, don't hang up.
  ans:
  - Stacy?

- que:
  - Was that doctored-up, too?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
  ans:
  - Just reporters.

- que:
  - Does that hurt?
  ans:
  - Well...yeah.

- que:
  - You opened the thing?
  ans:
  - The lingerie.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Oh Christ.

- que:
  - Are you sure you're safe?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is it over?
  ans:
  - It's over.

- que:
  - It's really over?
  ans:
  - Albert's gonna get me my job back.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - My suitcase is gone.

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.

- que:
  - Is this a fuckin' joke?
  ans:
  - I don't believe it is, no.

- que:
  - Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
  ans:
  - It's not?

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' what?
  ans:
  - I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.

- que:
  - You didn't squeeze DePinto?
  ans:
  - No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.

- que:
  - And then what?
  ans:
  - I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.

- que:
  - How's the trout?
  ans:
  - It tastes like fish.

- que:
  - Do you like fish?
  ans:
  - Brill.

- que:
  - Brill?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Good. You're just what I need right now.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - You got a minute?
  ans:
  - It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.

- que:
  - Who's doing this?
  ans:
  - I gotta go.

- que:
  - You being audited?
  ans:
  - For the last four years.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Tell me about Brill.

- que:
  - This conversation's over.
  ans:
  - I've never met him?

- que:
  - What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
  ans:
  - I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.

- que:
  - You're a moron, you know that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Any idea what he looks like?
  ans:
  - My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.

- que:
  - Who are you people?
  ans:
  - I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.

- que:
  - My shoe?
  ans:
  - Gimme the shoe.

- que:
  - And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
  ans:
  - I have to go lingerie shopping.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - Brill.

- que:
  - Who would do that?
  ans:
  - She doesn't want to talk to you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.

- que:
  - Are those my Christmas presents?
  ans:
  - Some of 'em.

- que:
  - Can I open 'em up?
  ans:
  - Sure, go ahead.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - He's kidding.

- que:
  - Where's mom?
  ans:
  - Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.

- que:
  - Are you and mom getting a divorce?
  ans:
  - No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.

- que:
  - Who won the fight?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How long can you stay?
  ans:
  - I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.

- que:
  - Did they take your clothes?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about jewelry?
  ans:
  - They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.

- que:
  - The blender?
  ans:
  - I love my blender.

- que:
  - They didn't take the silverware?
  ans:
  - No, but they took my blender.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They only took electrical appliances.

- que:
  - I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
  ans:
  - The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.

- que:
  - Into what?
  ans:
  - Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.

- que:
  - Rachel's dead?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - To the cops?
  ans:
  - To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Turn yourself in.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Go fuck yourself.

- que:
  - Yeah, what's going on?
  ans:
  - Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.

- que:
  - You remember Daniel Zavitz?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What does that have to do with you?
  ans:
  - I honestly don't know.

- que:
  - Was Zavitz in trouble?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What is it you want?
  ans:
  - Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.

- que:
  - You would?
  ans:
  - Yes. But we can't.

- que:
  - I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Then what's your goddam opinion?
  ans:
  - Get it.

- que:
  - It means who's side are you on?
  ans:
  - You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I said fuck you.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.

- que:
  - What about the tapes?
  ans:
  - We found the originals.

- que:
  - The originals?
  ans:
  - There was a transfer.

- que:
  - Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney. Mr. Reynolds? Sir?
  ans:
  - We'd have to--

- que:
  - Hiding something?
  ans:
  - It was in his bag. Now it's not.

- que:
  - 30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
  ans:
  - He had help.

- que:
  - We believe?
  ans:
  - Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.

- que:
  - What about the tape?
  ans:
  - We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.

- que:
  - And if it wasn't?
  ans:
  - Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.

- que:
  - Do you have visual?
  ans:
  - Not yet. He's near \"M\" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.

- que:
  - What's your ETA?
  ans:
  - Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.

- que:
  - Federal Express?
  ans:
  - For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.

- que:
  - How'd you get in the building?
  ans:
  - The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.

- que:
  - It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
  ans:
  - The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?

- que:
  - Puffed cheese?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Now is that clear?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - How much did you pay?
  ans:
  - Hello! Good morning.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.

- que:
  - I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
  ans:
  - Excuse me.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - After the market, you followed me to the hotel.

- que:
  - What do you mean, poetry?
  ans:
  - A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.

- que:
  - What is he saying? Come on, what did he say?
  ans:
  - He said - be careful.

- que:
  - Her or me?
  ans:
  - Actually, you sing.

- que:
  - Pardon?
  ans:
  - You sing. All the time.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - I thought you might paste them into your book.

- que:
  - What am I looking at?
  ans:
  - See what's happening to them - the stars.

- que:
  - This is not very good, is it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Shall we be all right?
  ans:
  - Yes. Absolutely.

- que:
  - Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
  ans:
  - Find that plant. Cut out its heart.

- que:
  - And the marriage - is that a fiction?
  ans:
  - No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

- que:
  - Do they know them?
  ans:
  - No, but I think I do.

- que:
  - Will you not come in?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Will you please come in?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.

- que:
  - When were you most happy?
  ans:
  - Now.

- que:
  - When were you least happy?
  ans:
  - Now.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Almsy nods.

- que:
  - A lie. What do you hate most?
  ans:
  - Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.

- que:
  - This is - what is this?
  ans:
  - It's a folk song.

- que:
  - Arabic?
  ans:
  - No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.

- que:
  - I don't care to bargain. It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
  ans:
  - It's beautiful. What's it about?

- que:
  - That day, had you followed me to the market?
  ans:
  - Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.

- que:
  - Shall we be all right?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

- que:
  - Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it?
  ans:
  - Don't do this.

- que:
  - Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
  ans:
  - You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists

- que:
  - Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I can't move. I can't get out.

- que:
  - Why did he bring you?
  ans:
  - A surprise, he said.

- que:
  - Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
  ans:
  - Don't talk.

- que:
  - Shall we be all right?
  ans:
  - Yes. Absolutely.

- que:
  - A broken car?
  ans:
  - Still a car.

- que:
  - What kind of photographs?
  ans:
  - It's Geoffrey under this.

- que:
  - Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
  ans:
  - I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If I could just see some identification.

- que:
  - Right. And what's your name, sir?
  ans:
  - Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal.

- que:
  - What did you think you were doing in his tent?
  ans:
  - Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.

- que:
  - And where are the Expedition Maps?
  ans:
  - In my room.

- que:
  - Why do they care about our maps?
  ans:
  - What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.

- que:
  - When's Clifton picking you up?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Is this you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Well, you must know. You were brought up Libya, yes?
  ans:
  - Don't cut me.

- que:
  - Or was it Toronto?
  ans:
  - Don't cut me. Come on.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Bonjour.

- que:
  - You were in Africa?
  ans:
  - Yeah, for a while.

- que:
  - So you can shoot a pistol?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where've you been?
  ans:
  - Rabbit hunting.

- que:
  - You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
  ans:
  - Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?

- que:
  - Hana? Hana? Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.

- que:
  - Who are his ghosts?
  ans:
  - Ask him.

- que:
  - What? How could he have? When?
  ans:
  - I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.

- que:
  - Where did you find that?
  ans:
  - I liberated it.

- que:
  - Hello.
  ans:
  - No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song?

- que:
  - Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
  ans:
  - Thief, I think, is more accurate.

- que:
  - I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
  ans:
  - Oh, all over.

- que:
  - Are you planning to be the exception?
  ans:
  - Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.

- que:
  - Is it you? If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
  ans:
  - Moose.

- que:
  - First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.

- que:
  - For?
  ans:
  - Top Hat.

- que:
  - Is there a song you don't know?
  ans:
  - Hana tells me you're leaving.

- que:
  - There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
  ans:
  - We shall miss you.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.

- que:
  - And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
  ans:
  - You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - The rest meant nothing to me.

- que:
  - But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
  ans:
  - Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me.

- que:
  - And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
  ans:
  - Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.

- que:
  - Oh.
  ans:
  - Oh really?

- que:
  - Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. I got hot.

- que:
  - Aren't you?
  ans:
  - Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.

- que:
  - Marvelous plane. Did you look?
  ans:
  - Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.

- que:
  - Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
  ans:
  - I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful.

- que:
  - I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
  ans:
  - Yes. Dropping off.

- que:
  - How? How can you see anything?
  ans:
  - Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.

- que:
  - Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
  ans:
  - Because I'm a nurse.

- que:
  - Why? Can he lay eggs?
  ans:
  - He's Canadian.

- que:
  - He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
  ans:
  - Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits.

- que:
  - Why? Is he staying?
  ans:
  - With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.

- que:
  - We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
  ans:
  - In that case, I suppose we can't charge.

- que:
  - Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing?
  ans:
  - I've been told that before.

- que:
  - Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
  ans:
  - Never heard of it.

- que:
  - Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door.

- que:
  - Is something funny?
  ans:
  - I've met you before.

- que:
  - For my hair?
  ans:
  - Yes, for your hair.

- que:
  - So I follow the wires?
  ans:
  - You get Hardy.

- que:
  - Why would anyone do this?
  ans:
  - I've done this. I've had to do this.

- que:
  - What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
  ans:
  - I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.

- que:
  - If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
  ans:
  - I try not to expect you.

- que:
  - But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
  ans:
  - Then I'd think there must be a reason.

- que:
  - What are you up to?
  ans:
  - I mean home. India.

- que:
  - Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
  ans:
  - It's what I've learned.

- que:
  - The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
  ans:
  - It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.

- que:
  - And what if he really is a spy?
  ans:
  - He can't even move.

- que:
  - He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
  ans:
  - Third Canadian Fusiliers.

- que:
  - He's gone, hasn't he?
  ans:
  - No. He's - no.

- que:
  - I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
  ans:
  - A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - What if you couldn't find him? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.

- que:
  - I thought that was for when we were very very old?
  ans:
  - I'm feeling old.

- que:
  - What's happening? Am I needed?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.

- que:
  - How awful. What will you do?
  ans:
  - Certainly not.

- que:
  - You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never!

- que:
  - What about your rank or serial number?
  ans:
  - No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.

- que:
  - Why? Are you German?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - This was your garden?
  ans:
  - Or my wife's.

- que:
  - I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
  ans:
  - Where were you? I called at 4,30 this morning.

- que:
  - I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
  ans:
  - I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.

- que:
  - So he popped the pane?
  ans:
  - Bingo.

- que:
  - You ordering chop suey again?
  ans:
  - Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.

- que:
  - You got a better idea?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Me.

- que:
  - Why didn't I think of that?
  ans:
  - It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.

- que:
  - How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
  ans:
  - I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.

- que:
  - Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
  ans:
  - We're getting close.

- que:
  - How close?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but close.

- que:
  - Where are you at least?
  ans:
  - I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.

- que:
  - Gin? Where the hell are you?
  ans:
  - I'm in the middle.

- que:
  - In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
  ans:
  - He's on to something bigger.

- que:
  - Who am I?
  ans:
  - That is of no interest.

- que:
  - Why are we speaking Chinese?
  ans:
  - Uh. I'm showing off.

- que:
  - I can't?
  ans:
  - It's sold.

- que:
  - You have a car?
  ans:
  - Uh, yes.

- que:
  - Are you...okay?
  ans:
  - It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.

- que:
  - Yes. But they don't have a clue. Why would anyone steal my luggage?
  ans:
  - Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I've got something...

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - So alive.

- que:
  - Do you mind?
  ans:
  - You...you can't.

- que:
  - No. Why would I be?
  ans:
  - Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.

- que:
  - Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
  ans:
  - Well, no...but...

- que:
  - We going somewhere?
  ans:
  - Possibly.

- que:
  - You want me to pick up a painting?
  ans:
  - Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.

- que:
  - If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
  ans:
  - It's a test.

- que:
  - Fine. What do I do?
  ans:
  - It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.

- que:
  - How much am I paying?
  ans:
  - I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.

- que:
  - Look on the back. What do you see?
  ans:
  - A film case.

- que:
  - What the hell do I do now?
  ans:
  - Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.

- que:
  - What the hell was that?
  ans:
  - Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.

- que:
  - You what--?
  ans:
  - Motorcycle.

- que:
  - What about your bags?
  ans:
  - I never carry...baggage.

- que:
  - Where's my bag?
  ans:
  - That's entrapment.

- que:
  - Lose something?
  ans:
  - I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.

- que:
  - Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
  ans:
  - I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.

- que:
  - Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
  ans:
  - My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.

- que:
  - Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
  ans:
  - In a week.

- que:
  - Only a week?
  ans:
  - They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.

- que:
  - We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
  ans:
  - We're doing this together. We're partners.

- que:
  - Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
  ans:
  - No. It's a down payment.

- que:
  - On what? Another job?
  ans:
  - We get the Mask I'll tell you.

- que:
  - So you're testing me now?
  ans:
  - Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.

- que:
  - Why don't we take oxygen?
  ans:
  - We are...for the tools.

- que:
  - Did I hear a car?
  ans:
  - Our equipment has arrived.

- que:
  - So how long to pop the floor?
  ans:
  - Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.

- que:
  - The lipstick thermal camera?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - Charged. Receiver?
  ans:
  - That's it. We're ready.

- que:
  - You bought this for me?
  ans:
  - Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.

- que:
  - Aren't we early?
  ans:
  - Little celebration before we set off.

- que:
  - You were afraid of heights?
  ans:
  - Terrified. Still am.

- que:
  - How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
  ans:
  - I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.

- que:
  - Let's mingle a little, shall we?
  ans:
  - One, two, three...

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Ready.

- que:
  - Can you see the other PIRs?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A billion dollars.

- que:
  - Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
  ans:
  - If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.

- que:
  - Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
  ans:
  - Hold the record. Alone.

- que:
  - The Mask. Where is it?
  ans:
  - You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.

- que:
  - What about the rules?
  ans:
  - My job, my rules.

- que:
  - Well...What are we doing?
  ans:
  - You're being useless. I'm making us rich.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.

- que:
  - So how long till we do this?
  ans:
  - We're doing it tonight.

- que:
  - How do I look?
  ans:
  - Like a woman of mystery.

- que:
  - Done. And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
  ans:
  - Surgically attached.

- que:
  - No way to take another day or two?
  ans:
  - No. You'll see when we get inside.

- que:
  - You have something in mind?
  ans:
  - Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.

- que:
  - So what are you going to do with your share?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't care about the money.

- que:
  - What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
  ans:
  - I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.

- que:
  - You mean the seven billion.
  ans:
  - What about you?

- que:
  - A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
  ans:
  - We need to make the trade tomorrow.

- que:
  - The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
  ans:
  - Had to get a liquid plasma screen.

- que:
  - You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
  ans:
  - We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.

- que:
  - Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
  ans:
  - It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.

- que:
  - How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
  ans:
  - You look like George Washington.

- que:
  - Suspicious, after all these years?
  ans:
  - You change partners, you change the rules.

- que:
  - Tonight your league night?
  ans:
  - Check out my ball.

- que:
  - Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
  ans:
  - It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.

- que:
  - You're impressed with her, aren't you?
  ans:
  - She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.

- que:
  - It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
  ans:
  - You know where my loyalties lie.

- que:
  - You're giving them to me?
  ans:
  - Call it an expression of trust.

- que:
  - You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
  ans:
  - I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.

- que:
  - Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
  ans:
  - My friend, you always surprise me.

- que:
  - That's a joke, right?
  ans:
  - Anna? With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.

- que:
  - I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
  ans:
  - Where've you been?

- que:
  - 250,000?
  ans:
  - In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.

- que:
  - What do you think? What's this?
  ans:
  - Tequila. From your drug dealer friend.

- que:
  - Erin Brockovich. Car accident. Not her fault, she says. And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't judge, Brenda.

- que:
  - What the hell is this doing here?
  ans:
  - It's those files you asked for.

- que:
  - I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
  ans:
  - Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

- que:
  - All of 'em?
  ans:
  - All of them.

- que:
  - Yeah. There's two. Why?
  ans:
  - So. You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.

- que:
  - What's your point?
  ans:
  - It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.

- que:
  - How does someone get meningitis?
  ans:
  - Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...

- que:
  - Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for them. You got a minute?
  ans:
  - This is a real nice place you got here.

- que:
  - Wow. Why would they do that?
  ans:
  - Cause of the chromium.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.

- que:
  - What's chromium?
  ans:
  - It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.

- que:
  - And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea. You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
  ans:
  - Sure you are. You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now. I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...

- que:
  - A number for the whole group, or for us?
  ans:
  - Both.

- que:
  - Five million dollars?
  ans:
  - Five million dollars.

- que:
  - ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen. Just wanna take good care of my kids. You know?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I know.

- que:
  - Okay, look. If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does. Send in a rsum, make an --
  ans:
  - Open and shut? Open and fucking shut?

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Out to lunch with the girls.

- que:
  - You do know how to do that, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I got it. No problem.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.

- que:
  - Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun.

- que:
  - Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.

- que:
  - So what's the story on this thing? This cancer stuff?
  ans:
  - You wanna know, you gotta hire me back. I got a lot of bills to pay.

- que:
  - But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
  ans:
  - They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.

- que:
  - So what made you think it was?
  ans:
  - It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.

- que:
  - The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office?
  ans:
  - I didn't see any medical records in there.

- que:
  - That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
  ans:
  - Course I did.

- que:
  - Lemme see it, will you?
  ans:
  - I want a raise. And benefits. Including dental.

- que:
  - This is the only thing you found?
  ans:
  - So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

- que:
  - So you think we got 'em scared?
  ans:
  - It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.

- que:
  - What, you think I'm made of money?
  ans:
  - Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom. They'll be driving around the valley for hours.

- que:
  - Hunh-uh. Absolutely not.
  ans:
  - Yeah. Isn't that a shame?

- que:
  - That's crazy -- why not?
  ans:
  - It's not about working hard --

- que:
  - How many families we talking about here?
  ans:
  - Four more. Eleven people. So far.

- que:
  - You think there's more?
  ans:
  - This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.

- que:
  - Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
  ans:
  - You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.

- que:
  - Is that what I think it is?
  ans:
  - She lived on the plume. You never know.

- que:
  - And that's what caused the contamination?
  ans:
  - It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

- que:
  - You didn't care about my case?
  ans:
  - I would now.

- que:
  - Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
  ans:
  - Someone's following me.

- que:
  - What? Who?
  ans:
  - Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer.

- que:
  - What kind of truck?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Big. Dark.

- que:
  - I was just asking. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - I want my paycheck. By the end of the day.

- que:
  - What kind of things come up?
  ans:
  - Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it or leave it.

- que:
  - So what are you thinking?
  ans:
  - ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.

- que:
  - Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
  ans:
  - Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.

- que:
  - Holy shit. Who do they represent, God?
  ans:
  - Don't joke. They might. So do me a favor and behave yourself for once. Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

- que:
  - Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
  ans:
  - What's a demur?

- que:
  - Perks? Jesus -- perks?
  ans:
  - If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.

- que:
  - Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
  ans:
  - Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal.

- que:
  - When? Where?
  ans:
  - Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance.

- que:
  - You see your office?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Yours is nicer.

- que:
  - Here what comes?
  ans:
  - The extortion, the threats ...

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Take it.

- que:
  - Two million dollars?
  ans:
  - The firm took in sixty. That's three percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me.

- que:
  - When'd they file the demur?
  ans:
  - Yesterday.

- que:
  - How many counts?
  ans:
  - Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all of 'em.

- que:
  - Who's the judge?
  ans:
  - Corey.

- que:
  - Did he say why?
  ans:
  - Nope. And I didn't ask.

- que:
  - Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
  ans:
  - Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind. So yeah, I took a look.

- que:
  - And you were told to destroy those?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well. There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding. That I kept instead.

- que:
  - How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
  ans:
  - Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.

- que:
  - Erin. Cool. What can I do for you, Erin?
  ans:
  - Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.

- que:
  - Pattee? That your middle name?
  ans:
  - Nope. Maiden.

- que:
  - Hey, Ross. Tell me something. Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
  ans:
  - So that stuff -- it kills people.

- que:
  - Hunh-uh. What's that?
  ans:
  - Every county has one. They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction. You should be able to find something there.

- que:
  - Mommy, can I get a flower?
  ans:
  - Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.

- que:
  - What are you doing? Where's George?
  ans:
  - You've been reading for hours.

- que:
  - What's going on in there?
  ans:
  - Some meeting. With PG&E people.

- que:
  - PG& -- Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yup. They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.

- que:
  - Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here. Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it. Does anyone know anything about these phones?
  ans:
  - There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town. It's impossible.

- que:
  - Can I play roller hockey?
  ans:
  - We'll see.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Randy's mom said yes right away.

- que:
  - God damn it, Matthew. What the hell are you doing out here?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna go live with George.

- que:
  - She's one of the sick people?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She is. But you know what? That's why I'm helping her. So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.

- que:
  - How come her own mom isn't helping her?
  ans:
  - Cause her own mom's real sick, too.

- que:
  - Whose number do you need?
  ans:
  - Everyone's. This is a lawsuit. We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.

- que:
  - I said, whose number do you need?
  ans:
  - You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.

- que:
  - What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
  ans:
  - Just introducing myself to the neighbors.

- que:
  - You want my number?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - You got more than one?
  ans:
  - Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten.

- que:
  - Ten?
  ans:
  - Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is.

- que:
  - You got a little girl?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Cause I don't even know you.

- que:
  - Yeah, and whose fault is that?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm probably ruining them.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.

- que:
  - Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
  ans:
  - I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.

- que:
  - Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
  ans:
  - It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice.

- que:
  - Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
  ans:
  - Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.

- que:
  - You're around every afternoon?
  ans:
  - Yup. Usually working on my bike. No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - Better safe than sorry.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Fixing a leak under your sink.

- que:
  - What kind of person lives like this? Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
  ans:
  - You're not nothing, Erin.

- que:
  - George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off. Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
  ans:
  - One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.

- que:
  - Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
  ans:
  - It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there.

- que:
  - You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?
  ans:
  - Keep your voice down.

- que:
  - No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there?
  ans:
  - Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.

- que:
  - I'm bored, and so are the kids.
  ans:
  - What? Beth? My Beth?

- que:
  - I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
  ans:
  - Cause it's my office party. If you had an office, I'd go to your party.

- que:
  - What's going on? What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Thinking.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About this.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I'm just working so hard --

- que:
  - You already packed up your stuff?
  ans:
  - I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you.

- que:
  - They up?
  ans:
  - Hunh-uh. Not yet. Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay? Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.

- que:
  - How long's this whole thing gonna take?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Few days. Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it.

- que:
  - Think you could learn?
  ans:
  - You know me. I pick things up real fast.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Real early. We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.

- que:
  - What do I look like, Erin? A library?
  ans:
  - Someone stole my stuff.

- que:
  - What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's called accountability.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I moved payroll onto the computer. It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.

- que:
  - Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
  ans:
  - You're clever. I'm sure you'll think of something.

- que:
  - Yeah. Who are you?
  ans:
  - When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I know. It's an awful lot.

- que:
  - Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?
  ans:
  - My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. I'm going to move in with her.

- que:
  - You're moving away? When?
  ans:
  - Next week.

- que:
  - ... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too. So I went and asked.
  ans:
  - Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this?

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.

- que:
  - The Emperor?
  ans:
  - Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....

- que:
  - Will he finish what he begins?
  ans:
  - We've come this far ... He is our only hope.

- que:
  - How you doing, Chewbacca? Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
  ans:
  - Growls a reserved greeting.

- que:
  - What's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - Three patrol ships are heading our way.

- que:
  - Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
  ans:
  - Barks at Han.

- que:
  - Not now, Chewie. Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
  ans:
  - Barks his concern.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Howls.

- que:
  - Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek, Yoda.
  ans:
  - Can't get your ship out? Have you tried? Have you tried?

- que:
  - You know the Jedi Master?
  ans:
  - Of course, yes. But now eat we must. Good food, I have good food. Come, come.

- que:
  - Not far, not far. Be patient. Soon you will see him. Why wish you become a Jedi?
  ans:
  - Because of my father, I guess.

- que:
  - Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
  ans:
  - I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance.

- que:
  - Not likely! Where are the speeders?
  ans:
  - We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...

- que:
  - What is thy bidding, My Master?
  ans:
  - There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

- que:
  - Our destruction? Who?
  ans:
  - The son of Skywalker. You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.

- que:
  - Captain Solo. What's the situation?
  ans:
  - There isn't a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.

- que:
  - Good, and Commander Skywalker?
  ans:
  - He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.

- que:
  - I shut it off. What's her royal holiness want?
  ans:
  - She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you. No one seems to know ...

- que:
  - I don't know, Artoo. Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
  ans:
  - You, too, golden rod.

- que:
  - You said you were going to stay. What happened?
  ans:
  - That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

- que:
  - Does Luke know?
  ans:
  - Han, we need you here.

- que:
  - We?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Not you?
  ans:
  - Me? I don't know what you mean.

- que:
  - And what are they, pray tell?
  ans:
  - You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.

- que:
  - And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
  ans:
  - Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct ....

- que:
  - Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
  ans:
  - Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.

- que:
  - Would it help if I got out and pushed?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.

- que:
  - I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
  ans:
  - Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.

- que:
  - To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
  ans:
  - Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - That should do nicely.

- que:
  - How do I look?
  ans:
  - Beautiful.

- que:
  - Where have I heard that before?
  ans:
  - Easy, your worship. Only trying to help.

- que:
  - Would you please stop calling me that?
  ans:
  - Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes.

- que:
  - What are you afraid of?
  ans:
  - Outside, in the cave.

- que:
  - You could have warned him before you shut him off.
  ans:
  - No lightspeed?

- que:
  - Oh, so sorry! Didn't mean to offend your droid. You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
  ans:
  - I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.

- que:
  - That depends. Where are we?
  ans:
  - Here ... near the Anoat system.

- que:
  - Can you trust him?
  ans:
  - No. But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...

- que:
  - Who's staring?
  ans:
  - You look silly.

- que:
  - Has Threepio turned up yet?
  ans:
  - I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.

- que:
  - Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
  ans:
  - I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.

- que:
  - Probe? What probe?
  ans:
  - That makes a good story. But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.

- que:
  - Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - I always said you were a gentleman.

- que:
  - That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
  ans:
  - Repairs ...

- que:
  - That ship saved my life a few times. It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy. What's wrong with her?
  ans:
  - Hyperdrive.

- que:
  - How's your mining operation going?
  ans:
  - Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.

- que:
  - All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
  ans:
  - Don't ask me, but he's on his way.

- que:
  - What about Leia and the Wookiee?
  ans:
  - You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

- que:
  - Hello! What have we here? Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
  ans:
  - You may call me Leia.

- que:
  - Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
  ans:
  - .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.

- que:
  - You're part of the mining guild then?
  ans:
  - It's a lovely outpost.

- que:
  - What about Han?
  ans:
  - I didn't know you had a price on your head. Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm coming over to your side, that's what. And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.

- que:
  - And when do you betray us again?
  ans:
  - Look, I stand to lose everything by this.

- que:
  - I didn't say anything?
  ans:
  - Luke needs help. We must go back.

- que:
  - Are the coordinates set?
  ans:
  - I'm sure my men fixed it. We've got nothing to worry about.

- que:
  - Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
  ans:
  - Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter. It's not much, but ...

- que:
  - Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
  ans:
  - Not yet. They're working on it now.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Two transports at a time is awfully risky.

- que:
  - Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Well, what now?
  ans:
  - Rather touchy, aren't they.

- que:
  - The Bacta are growing well. The scars should be gone in a day or so. Does it still hurt?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. Really. Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - First Han, now you. When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...

- que:
  - Han's leaving?
  ans:
  - Calm down, will ya? Tell me about Han.

- que:
  - Jabba the Hutt?
  ans:
  - I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.

- que:
  - Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there? How's Luke?
  ans:
  - He'll survive.

- que:
  - Why not me?
  ans:
  - To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.

- que:
  - Size has no meaning. It matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you?
  ans:
  - I don't believe it.

- que:
  - Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
  ans:
  - No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive.

- que:
  - But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
  ans:
  - You will know. When you are at peace ... calm ... passive. A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack.

- que:
  - What's in there?
  ans:
  - Only what you take with you.

- que:
  - Ben? Ben?
  ans:
  - Free your mind and return he will.

- que:
  - Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too. You have far to go in your training.
  ans:
  - Will they die?

- que:
  - Yes, yes. To Obi-wan you listen young one. The tree. Remember your failure at the tree! Heh?
  ans:
  - I've learned so much since then. And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.

- que:
  - And sacrifice Han and Leia?
  ans:
  - If it must be. Yes.

- que:
  - The Hoth System?
  ans:
  - Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

- que:
  - Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
  ans:
  - It won't get through the blockade.

- que:
  - Me, too. Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse. Have we fed them? Like raw steak or something?
  ans:
  - The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.

- que:
  - Excuse me. I didn't mean to disturb.... What am I saying?
  ans:
  - They're...pretending to dress.

- que:
  - What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing. Where'd they get those clothes?
  ans:
  - So am I. And I mean you no harm.

- que:
  - Do you have a name?
  ans:
  - My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira -- my wife.

- que:
  - Believe what?
  ans:
  - That primitive apes can talk.

- que:
  - Zira, are you mad?
  ans:
  - Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.

- que:
  - What, Lewis?
  ans:
  - There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.

- que:
  - With food?
  ans:
  - No -- clothes. Stevie, they changed into them.

- que:
  - What are they doing here?
  ans:
  - Security. Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...

- que:
  - Humans?
  ans:
  - I'm a psychiatrist.

- que:
  - C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
  ans:
  - May I say something personal?

- que:
  - You never heard of Snake Plissken?
  ans:
  - He doesn't look like his picture. I bet he's fake.

- que:
  - Cuervo...?
  ans:
  - You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.

- que:
  - Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. Understand? Understand?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE He jumped. Down there. He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE Oh Cuervo...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE It's so good to see you again.

- que:
  - Where's Plissken?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE He's... near.

- que:
  - Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
  ans:
  - I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.

- que:
  - My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
  ans:
  - I need a favor.

- que:
  - What's in it for me?
  ans:
  - Wait a minute. I know that voice. You're Carjack Malone.

- que:
  - I see your point. What's the favor?
  ans:
  - Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.

- que:
  - So what's the deal, gorgeous?
  ans:
  - We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.

- que:
  - No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet.

- que:
  - You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
  ans:
  - Shut up, Plissken.

- que:
  - What's the little black box do?
  ans:
  - Top secret. Only on a need to know.

- que:
  - So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
  ans:
  - That's the deal.

- que:
  - Having second thoughts?
  ans:
  - Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.

- que:
  - So what does this thing do?
  ans:
  - All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.

- que:
  - So you want me to take her out? Is that an order from the President?
  ans:
  - Let's just say it's what's best for the country.

- que:
  - By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
  ans:
  - A medical team will be standing by.

- que:
  - Not you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Plissken...?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I got it.

- que:
  - Got a smoke?
  ans:
  - The name's Plissken.

- que:
  - Does he know how to activate it?
  ans:
  - Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.

- que:
  - Where'd they go?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - Location.

- que:
  - Delgado?
  ans:
  - Stop the damn car.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE Right over there.

- que:
  - Where are they going?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.

- que:
  - THE STARS EDDIE Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me?
  ans:
  - Later.

- que:
  - How do you know all this?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.

- que:
  - THE STARS EDDIE Me too?
  ans:
  - We'll see.

- que:
  - THE STARS EDDIE I got an idea, Snake. This looks like the prototype, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, kinda.

- que:
  - Is that what I think it is?
  ans:
  - THE STARS EDDIE Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.

- que:
  - What're you doing in here?
  ans:
  - Looking to get out.

- que:
  - Which way?
  ans:
  - Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.

- que:
  - Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
  ans:
  - All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.

- que:
  - Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
  ans:
  - Down that way.

- que:
  - Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
  ans:
  - Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.

- que:
  - Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - No screamin' shit.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.

- que:
  - How do we get out of here?
  ans:
  - Sewers. Come on.

- que:
  - Snake - what is it?
  ans:
  - How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.

- que:
  - Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.

- que:
  - What the hell is this?
  ans:
  - The freeway.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do in Venice?
  ans:
  - Find Cuervo Jones.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.

- que:
  - Where's the anti-toxin...?
  ans:
  - Give me the prototype.

- que:
  - Hey, what's going down, Snake?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for somebody.

- que:
  - Who ain't?
  ans:
  - You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.

- que:
  - Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
  ans:
  - Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.

- que:
  - All of us?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is he coming?
  ans:
  - He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.

- que:
  - When you threw it in, what did you see?
  ans:
  - ...I saw nothing.

- que:
  - I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
  ans:
  - --That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.

- que:
  - Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
  ans:
  - We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...

- que:
  - Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
  ans:
  - It is deep...

- que:
  - Of Merlin?
  ans:
  - Speak of the devil!...

- que:
  - Whose son am I?
  ans:
  - In the great book.

- que:
  - What book is that?
  ans:
  - What?!

- que:
  - Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
  ans:
  - You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.

- que:
  - At your service, sir.
  ans:
  - Excalibur! Is it true?

- que:
  - Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
  ans:
  - Never where you expect it, that's all I know.

- que:
  - What is it my child?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
  ans:
  - That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...

- que:
  - I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
  ans:
  - I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.

- que:
  - What is this place, Merlin?
  ans:
  - But, I'm here.

- que:
  - Your mother told you that?
  ans:
  - I cannot offer you the land, only my love...

- que:
  - You freed it, son?
  ans:
  - I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.

- que:
  - Who is, then?
  ans:
  - He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.

- que:
  - It didn't hurt too much, did it?
  ans:
  - Ye...

- que:
  - --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
  ans:
  - I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.

- que:
  - Why can't you be my champion?
  ans:
  - If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.

- que:
  - Who does it serve?
  ans:
  - You, my lord.

- que:
  - I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
  ans:
  - Because you and the land are one.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.

- que:
  - And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
  ans:
  - There is one.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yes. I would swear my love to you.

- que:
  - To me? But why?
  ans:
  - He has given up.

- que:
  - Twenty days!? The world is that big?
  ans:
  - I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...

- que:
  - Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
  ans:
  - It is.

- que:
  - Can it truly be used for magic?
  ans:
  - No, no, of course not. You are young...

- que:
  - People make you laugh?
  ans:
  - They do.

- que:
  - Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
  ans:
  - Just show the sword.

- que:
  - I?
  ans:
  - The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.

- que:
  - To kill and be king, is that all?
  ans:
  - You strike me with words as hard as steel.

- que:
  - Well why are they tearing the building down?
  ans:
  - Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.

- que:
  - What honey?
  ans:
  - Fuck it.

- que:
  - And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
  ans:
  - How about Lankaster Merrin.

- que:
  - What's he doing there? Teaching?
  ans:
  - No, he's working on another book.

- que:
  - Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
  ans:
  - It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.

- que:
  - You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hi, how'd your day go?
  ans:
  - Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.

- que:
  - Oh great, anything else?
  ans:
  - And you got an invitation.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Dinner at the White House.

- que:
  - Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
  ans:
  - Just five or six people.

- que:
  - Why don't you let me?
  ans:
  - What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...

- que:
  - Didn't who tell me?
  ans:
  - Burke.

- que:
  - What's Burke got to do with it?
  ans:
  - Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.

- que:
  - What did the doctor say?
  ans:
  - We have to start looking for a shrink.

- que:
  - This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
  ans:
  - Of course I didn't.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Phonograph.

- que:
  - Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
  ans:
  - No, she was heavily sedated.

- que:
  - It's serious?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm affraid it is.

- que:
  - May I ask...?
  ans:
  - We still don't know.

- que:
  - You were expecting a deliver y that day?
  ans:
  - Not that I know of.

- que:
  - Groceries maybe? A package?
  ans:
  - I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.

- que:
  - Want to ask him?
  ans:
  - Never mind.

- que:
  - Would you like some more coffee?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked \"What's this fungus?\" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
  ans:
  - When she's well enough, I'll ask.

- que:
  - Of course. Have you got a pen?
  ans:
  - Oh, she'd love it.

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.

- que:
  - Rats?
  ans:
  - Uh huh. 'Fraid so.

- que:
  - But it's clean?
  ans:
  - No. It wasn't me. I didn't.

- que:
  - A man to see you.
  ans:
  - Excuse me Miss?

- que:
  - Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
  ans:
  - No thanks Karl.

- que:
  - How are you today?
  ans:
  - Fine thank you.

- que:
  - Is it coming out Willie?
  ans:
  - Yes, I think so.

- que:
  - Why the math?
  ans:
  - It affects concentration.

- que:
  - What is it? A tranquilizer?
  ans:
  - A stimulant.

- que:
  - Depression?
  ans:
  - Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.

- que:
  - Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
  ans:
  - Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.

- que:
  - Lies?
  ans:
  - Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.

- que:
  - Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
  ans:
  - Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.

- que:
  - You're kidding! Like what?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.

- que:
  - She used those words?
  ans:
  - She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.

- que:
  - Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
  ans:
  - The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.

- que:
  - Convulsion?
  ans:
  - The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.

- que:
  - So, what causes this?
  ans:
  - Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.

- que:
  - What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
  ans:
  - We still think the temporal lobe...

- que:
  - Do you keep any drugs in your house?
  ans:
  - No. Of course not, nothing like that.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

- que:
  - Chris MacNeil?
  ans:
  - Please go away.

- que:
  - So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
  ans:
  - It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.

- que:
  - You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
  ans:
  - Yes am.

- que:
  - Pretty close?
  ans:
  - Pretty close.

- que:
  - Did he tell you about my party?
  ans:
  - Sure did.

- que:
  - About my daughter?
  ans:
  - No I didn't know you had one.

- que:
  - He didn't mention?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Didn't tell you of what she did?
  ans:
  - He didn't mention her.

- que:
  - Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
  ans:
  - That depends.

- que:
  - On what?
  ans:
  - The priest.

- que:
  - If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
  ans:
  - Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.

- que:
  - I didn't get you?
  ans:
  - Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, since when?
  ans:
  - Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.

- que:
  - Why, I don't understand?
  ans:
  - To begin with it could make things worse.

- que:
  - But how?
  ans:
  - Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you know my mother died recently?
  ans:
  - Yes I did, I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Not at all. Why d'you ask?
  ans:
  - It's not important good night.

- que:
  - What do you drink?
  ans:
  - No it's alright I'll take it straight.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - It's fine really, sit.

- que:
  - Where's Regan's father?
  ans:
  - In Europe.

- que:
  - I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
  ans:
  - Have you told him what's happening?

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.

- que:
  - Is she gonna die?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What did you do today?
  ans:
  - Um........Stuff.

- que:
  - What kind of stuff?
  ans:
  - Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.

- que:
  - Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
  ans:
  - Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.

- que:
  - Your kidding?
  ans:
  - Well, not while we're in Washington.

- que:
  - When can I have one?
  ans:
  - We'll see Regan. Now about those party invitations.......

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  - Oh it's so funny.

- que:

  - You'd like that?
  ans:
  - Intensely.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - There's only one.

- que:
  - Why this girl it makes no sense?
  ans:
  - I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Her heart.

- que:
  - Can you give her something?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.

- que:
  - And Dennings, you read how he died?
  ans:
  - Yeah, a fall.

- que:
  - You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
  ans:
  - Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.

- que:
  - Sick priest, is that it?
  ans:
  - I don't know anyone who fits the description.

- que:
  - Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
  ans:

  - No.

- que:
  - If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You wanted to see me, Charlie?
  ans:

  - Five's my guess. Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there. Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.

- que:
  - How will he eat?
  ans:
  - Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes. Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.

- que:
  - No bones?
  ans:
  - No bones.

- que:
  - What do you do to him?

  - Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.

  - Hey, you weren't there. Right?
  ans:
  - Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.

- que:
  - We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
  ans:
  - I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You, Frank. All these years you been telling me we're different. We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.

  ans:
  - We were just having a little discussion about morality.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - He's with the hotel. I called him.

  - It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
  ans:
  - It was just a can of beer, Frank.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I can't make the tenth.

  - What disease?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - It's a disease, Jack. We're against it. It's not a moral decision.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Jack, you're on television.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.

  - Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance?
  ans:
  - Don't take it personally.

  ans:
  - We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed.

- que:
  - Am I missing something?
  ans:

  - Give me that.

- que:
  - Jack, you with us?
  ans:

  - What do you say we send a bottle over?
  ans:
  - I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank.

  - What's with you two?
  ans:
  - Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.

- que:
  - Got another song for us?
  ans:
  - Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.

  ans:
  - I just saw a man walk out of your room.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.

- que:
  - I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
  ans:
  - Susie. It's one more show. One more time. That's all.

- que:
  - Is that important?
  ans:
  - Uh, well ...

- que:
  - Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
  ans:
  - I'll call you.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. That's quite a girl you boys latched onto. She a local?
  ans:
  - Born and bred.

- que:
  - Lucky for you. Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
  ans:
  - We trust you, Lloyd. You know that.

- que:
  - Whatcha doin' over there?
  ans:
  - Gotta go.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Job.

- que:
  - Will I see you again?
  ans:
  - Brought it.

- que:
  - So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here. What d'ya say?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - Barker. Jock Barker?
  ans:
  - Baker. Jack Baker.

- que:
  - You want to know if he's okay. Right?
  ans:
  - Black. Labrador.

- que:
  - Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
  ans:
  - Downstairs.

- que:
  - And you don't?
  ans:
  - He leads, I follow.

- que:
  - Is that the way it is?
  ans:
  - Pretty much.

- que:
  - You miss him, don't you?
  ans:
  - It's been a long time, Ma.

- que:
  - Hey, he's not sore, is he?
  ans:
  - He'll come around.

- que:
  - You never sang before?
  ans:
  - Not for money. With my mother.

- que:
  - The Park? It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
  ans:
  - Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.

- que:
  - Where's egghead?
  ans:
  - His kid's sick.

- que:
  - Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again?
  ans:
  - The Stratford.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir.

- que:
  - Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes.

- que:
  - You want me to walk you?
  ans:
  - Every year.

- que:
  - Aren't the kids asleep?
  ans:
  - Every year.

- que:
  - So why's he do it?
  ans:
  - I guess in case one year they're not.

- que:
  - Can't sleep?
  ans:
  - In and out.

- que:
  - Like a baby. You?
  ans:
  - In and out.

- que:
  - Just dinner and dance, right?
  ans:
  - Relax. We'll drop the song.

- que:
  - How do you do it? Every night?
  ans:
  - Practice. There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What'd I say?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.

- que:
  - Who's Nina?
  ans:
  - Friend.

- que:
  - I have to make him some chili. Okay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How come you didn't close your eyes?
  ans:
  - You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. At the Roosevelt.

- que:
  - Soap?
  ans:
  - History.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - My father proposed to my mother in there.

- que:
  - The both of them? In there?
  ans:
  - He called her.

- que:
  - Oh. So what's it doing here?
  ans:
  - Long story.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - You're kidding.

- que:
  - So, what happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.

- que:
  - Coffee?
  ans:
  - Yeah... No.

- que:
  - Saw the sign outside. Got your own sign, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Got my own sign.

- que:
  - So ... ?
  ans:
  - We outgrew each other.

- que:
  - So how's the cat food business?
  ans:
  - Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Vegetables.

- que:
  - Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
  ans:
  - Losing his teeth.

- que:
  - Another five years, huh?
  ans:
  - Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie.

- que:
  - It ain't always a blessing. My brother here?
  ans:
  - He's got blood in his eye.

- que:
  - Did you break a cup, Jack?
  ans:
  - Eddie did.

- que:
  - What happened to the donut king?
  ans:
  - Married.

- que:
  - Is that what you used to do?
  ans:
  - My days are not the old days, genius.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - The recent past.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I saw his stuff in the bathroom.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - I guess it's getting serious.

- que:
  - I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this?
  ans:
  - Ivory.

- que:
  - Ever go to church?
  ans:
  - I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.

- que:
  - Okay. How'd yours go?
  ans:
  - Not so good.

- que:
  - Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
  ans:
  - Jack.

- que:
  - Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here?
  ans:
  - Merry Christmas, Jack.

- que:
  - Fine. You?
  ans:
  - Oh, fine.

- que:
  - Big piece or little?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, no.

- que:
  - None?
  ans:
  - I'm not much for sweets.

- que:
  - How's that dog of yours? What was his name?
  ans:
  - Eddie.

- que:
  - Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
  ans:
  - He's losing his teeth.

- que:
  - Waxy Wright. Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
  ans:
  - They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags. We heard you got wasted.

- que:
  - Do I look wasted -- asshole?
  ans:
  - You look great, Castor. Really. Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal. Even has the worm.

- que:
  - What did he do?
  ans:
  - He hit a guard.

- que:
  - I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say \"thanks\"?
  ans:
  - ... Thanks.

- que:
  - What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
  ans:
  - Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - My place.

- que:
  - How old is he?
  ans:
  - Five. No one knows you're his father. I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.

- que:
  - And this thing can grow it?
  ans:
  - Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.

- que:
  - Why would he need more?
  ans:
  - He's your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.

- que:
  - A few blanks? Like what?
  ans:
  - Like ...

- que:
  - Uh -- to kill the doctors?
  ans:
  - After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.

- que:
  - What's worse than losing five million bucks?
  ans:
  - Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows. Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - We need to talk.

- que:
  - Something good?
  ans:
  - We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.

- que:
  - Were you there to catch me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - I don't know ... Maybe because you've never needed my help.

- que:
  - You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?
  ans:
  - Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is your husband -- isn't.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Never mind that! Just take Jamie and get out of that house. Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.

- que:
  - How did he expect to do that?
  ans:
  - I took it from my fake husband.

- que:
  - What more proof do you need?
  ans:
  - Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.

- que:
  - Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
  ans:
  - Christ, Jon! How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us? Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.

- que:
  - Jon, what is it?
  ans:
  - The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.

- que:
  - Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
  ans:
  - I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is \"me.\" We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - No life signs at all. He's a turnip.

- que:
  - Would it?
  ans:
  - Damn right.

- que:
  - How's Loomis?
  ans:
  - Apparently, fine. He's coming into work. That's the good news ...

- que:
  - Which ear was it?
  ans:
  - The left, I think. Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.

- que:
  - Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it. What about Eve?
  ans:
  - She doesn't know -- and she never will.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Call Lazarro. Castor just came out of his coma.

- que:
  - How is the \"date night\" idea going over with Eve?
  ans:
  - Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.

- que:
  - You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her? When was the last time you two had sex?
  ans:
  - One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.

- que:
  - You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
  ans:
  - Mention my family once more and you're dead.

- que:
  - -- Castor?
  ans:
  - Not anymore.

- que:
  - Too late, your kid worships me. And your wife -- she's an animal. Even I can't keep up with her.
  ans:
  - What are you going to do, Castor?

- que:
  - What -- what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.

- que:
  - I don't know. How long before it kills us?
  ans:
  - Five seconds.

- que:
  - You'll what?
  ans:
  - I'm going to have you fired.

- que:
  - Pollux is -- what?
  ans:
  - SFPD? Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.

- que:
  - What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
  ans:
  - I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.

- que:
  - Castor Troy almost strangled me to death. Where the hell were you?
  ans:
  - Screw your boundaries, Janie. You have something I want.

- que:
  - Janie?
  ans:
  - Clarissa left those here.

- que:
  - When did you start smoking?
  ans:
  - You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.

- que:
  - You mean like ... condoms?
  ans:
  - I mean like protection.

- que:
  - That's your name, isn't it?
  ans:
  - You always call me Miss Brewster.

- que:
  - Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
  ans:
  - You've got someone in your office.

- que:
  - Escaped? From Erewhon? I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
  ans:
  - The Admiral?

- que:
  - I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
  ans:
  - What happened?

- que:
  - No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you! But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
  ans:
  - Trust me. You're gonna love it ...

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - A lot of people think you're a snitch. It's dangerous ...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Me. I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.

- que:
  - I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
  ans:
  - What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.

- que:
  - What do you know about it?
  ans:
  - As much as ever. Nothing.

- que:
  - It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
  ans:
  - The hospital.

- que:
  - Don't I usually kiss my wife?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
  ans:
  - I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.

- que:
  - Isn't that what all this is about? Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
  ans:
  - I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.

- que:
  - What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - Jon, it's the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - -- Studying.

- que:
  - Where's Jamie?
  ans:
  - That's what I'd like to know. She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.

- que:
  - Wait a second -- you hated Madonna. Didn't you?
  ans:
  - You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.

- que:
  - Her assistant?
  ans:
  - Yeah Jack, her assistant...

- que:
  - You? Married?
  ans:
  - Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.

- que:
  - So you left her? Just like that?
  ans:
  - God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...

- que:
  - No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants?
  ans:
  - She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.

- que:
  - Adelle?
  ans:
  - You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...

- que:
  - You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe...

- que:
  - Why Jack?
  ans:
  - Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...

- que:
  - You have kids, Jack?
  ans:
  - Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.

- que:
  - A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
  ans:
  - Thats right. And auto supply...

- que:
  - Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
  ans:
  - Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - ...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - But I think I like you better this way...

- que:
  - Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Youre jumping, sweetheart...
  ans:
  - So what are we gonna do, Jack?

- que:
  - Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
  ans:
  - Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...

- que:
  - Fightings a part of it, Annie. You know that, right?
  ans:
  - Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...

- que:
  - Wheres my real dad?
  ans:
  - I dont know...

- que:
  - Who did?
  ans:
  - The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.

- que:
  - Do you like kids?
  ans:
  - On a case by case basis...

- que:
  - You know how to make chocolate milk?
  ans:
  - I think I could figure it out.

- que:
  - You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Where do I go now?
  ans:
  - Big Eds.

- que:
  - Big Eds? Big Eds Tires? Why...?
  ans:
  - Thats where you work.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - One year he had a solar system named after her...

- que:
  - Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
  ans:
  - Mom liked it.

- que:
  - Very nice. What is it?
  ans:
  - Mary Had A Little Lamb.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Ringing my bell...

- que:
  - Is it morning yet?
  ans:
  - No, honey. Go back to sleep.

- que:
  - I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner. Its throwin everybody off. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Great room...

- que:
  - Were friends, arent we?
  ans:
  - Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...

- que:
  - Trouble at work?
  ans:
  - I dont think so.

- que:
  - Its not Kate, is it?
  ans:
  - You see, its like were in each others heads...

- que:
  - Its just two kids, right?
  ans:
  - Hey, Im doing the best I can... Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...

- que:
  - She said that?
  ans:
  - Pretty much.

- que:
  - Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
  ans:
  - It wouldnt really be cheating... Its complicated.

- que:
  - Hey, is that really necessary?
  ans:
  - All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...

- que:
  - Its your birthday? Today? Whats your name? Where were you born?
  ans:
  - Hey, you cant park that thing here.

- que:
  - Howd you know my name?
  ans:
  - We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.

- que:
  - Got a minute, Jack?
  ans:
  - Ive got all the time in the world...

- que:
  - There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
  ans:
  - How'd you know my name was Jack?

- que:
  - A lucky streak, huh?
  ans:
  - I don't do that. That's just not for me...

- que:
  - Everyone needs something.
  ans:
  - Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - You just said everyone needs something.

- que:
  - You still think this is about me, don't you?
  ans:
  - Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.

- que:
  - As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
  ans:
  - Miss me, Jack?

- que:
  - Look, I just want my life back. Now whats it gonna take? You wanna talk turkey? Lets talk turkey! How much money...?
  ans:
  - Do I look like I need your money. It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.

- que:
  - Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - But what do I do?
  ans:
  - Look Jack Im late. Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business... Happy trails.

- que:
  - Like the dress...?
  ans:
  - Its lovely...

- que:
  - Finger food...?
  ans:
  - I dont think so, thank you...

- que:
  - Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Are we finally being honest?
  ans:
  - It would help me if we were.

- que:
  - Frank. Wheres Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
  ans:
  - Mr. Mintz? I dont think so...buildings closed pal. Youll have to come back tomorrow.

- que:
  - Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
  ans:
  - Uh...sure Jack... Right back there...

- que:
  - ...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988. Did you know that?
  ans:
  - No, I didnt...thats great.

- que:
  - Here we are, mag wheels... Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
  ans:
  - Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...

- que:
  - Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
  ans:
  - Okay, chief.

- que:
  - Howd you do this year, Tony?
  ans:
  - Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...

- que:
  - All in one tape?
  ans:
  - I also put side two of London Calling on there...

- que:
  - You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
  ans:
  - Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go. Im sorry, you should just go...

- que:
  - No, youre right. What are we doing?
  ans:
  - We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah...fine.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - I was in the city.

- que:
  - The city? New York City? Why?
  ans:
  - Because thats where I live.

- que:
  - You look forward to this party all year. Whats with you today?
  ans:
  - Trust me on this Kate. I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because youll be here.

- que:
  - Christ... Where the hell is the bathroom?
  ans:
  - Funny, Jack. Im laughing on the inside.

- que:
  - And...?
  ans:
  - Jack. I said the kids are asleep...

- que:
  - Wait a second. You want me, dont you?
  ans:
  - That is the general idea, yes...

- que:
  - Shouldnt we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...?
  ans:
  - Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...

- que:
  - $2,400?! Are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - She got those shoes...

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.

- que:
  - Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
  ans:
  - Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.

- que:
  - I think it worked out okay, dont you?
  ans:
  - Sure. I really like Annie.

- que:
  - Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Whyd we ever leave?
  ans:
  - You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...

- que:
  - You had a heart attack?
  ans:
  - Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.

- que:
  - Thats why I work for Big Ed?
  ans:
  - Our life in a nutshell...

- que:
  - You mean this chocolate cake?
  ans:
  - Thats my piece. I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.

- que:
  - You want the cake!?
  ans:
  - I want it...

- que:
  - Its good, right?
  ans:
  - Say it, Jack...

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - Cmon, you know what I like to hear...

- que:
  - Not it...?
  ans:
  - Nice, Jack. Youre sweeping me off my feet.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. Youre my wife?
  ans:
  - Maybe I should wait...

- que:
  - Jack...can we afford all this?
  ans:
  - Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...

- que:
  - How do you even know about this place?
  ans:
  - You are so not off the hook yet, slick.

- que:
  - But Im gettin close, right?
  ans:
  - I need to tell you something.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Worse, you mean...

- que:
  - And now...?
  ans:
  - Now...I dont...

- que:
  - What are you sure about?
  ans:
  - You know champagne makes me do crazy things.

- que:
  - Im out of the doghouse?
  ans:
  - Way out...

- que:
  - Pretty incredible, isnt it?
  ans:
  - Its like a museum.

- que:
  - So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
  ans:
  - Think bigger.

- que:
  - For the week?
  ans:
  - This place is a perk, Kate.

- que:
  - A perk for what?
  ans:
  - A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...

- que:
  - Are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...

- que:
  - I cant believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
  ans:
  - Jack.

- que:
  - But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
  ans:
  - Youve been Jack Campbell. And thats always a good thing...

- que:
  - Are you okay, Jack?
  ans:
  - I promise, Jack...

- que:
  - Whats going on?
  ans:
  - Im moving to Paris...it was right here... Its a box marked Jack. I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...

- que:
  - Paris?
  ans:
  - Youre moving...

- que:
  - So youre not at a non- profit firm?
  ans:
  - Not with what they pay me...

- que:
  - Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
  ans:
  - Youre not married, are you?

- que:
  - What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
  ans:
  - Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...

- que:
  - Its because Im shy, Betty. So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
  ans:
  - You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...

- que:
  - Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
  ans:
  - I need you, tiger..

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Aspen.

- que:
  - You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
  ans:
  - Not by a long shot.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real life...

- que:
  - Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate. Is that good enough for you?
  ans:
  - Damn...damn...damn...

- que:
  - Hey, are you okay?
  ans:
  - No...Im not...

- que:
  - Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
  ans:
  - Im sorry, no...

- que:
  - Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
  ans:
  - Of course I did.

- que:
  - Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
  ans:
  - I'm taking the train...

- que:
  - Don't you have anywhere to go?
  ans:
  - I've got plenty of places to go.

- que:
  - Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning... Okay?
  ans:
  - If it's something you feel strongly about.

- que:
  - Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
  ans:
  - You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.

- que:
  - I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
  ans:
  - I'm not really dressed for a party.

- que:
  - Those yours too?
  ans:
  - My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.

- que:
  - What about his first born?
  ans:
  - Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.

- que:
  - When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
  ans:
  - Five times.

- que:
  - Isn't that your speech?
  ans:
  - He's made a few changes.

- que:
  - Should?
  ans:
  - I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.

- que:
  - Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Solid.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.

- que:
  - You got a chisel round here?
  ans:
  - If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

- que:
  - Where...where am I?
  ans:
  - Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.

- que:
  - Reed? ... Sue?
  ans:
  - They're fine. Everybody else...is fine.

- que:
  - Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
  ans:
  - What's wrong with me?

- que:
  - Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said \"together forever no matter what\"?
  ans:
  - Baby, you're scaring me.

- que:
  - Oh my G-g-g. What did you...do to Ben?
  ans:
  - Deb, it's me. It's still me.

- que:
  - What did you wish for, honey?
  ans:
  - I already got it. Everything I want.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm worried about you.

- que:
  - What is this? Where's Reed?
  ans:
  - Where do you think.

- que:
  - What do you want, Vic?
  ans:
  - I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

- que:
  - Is it safe?
  ans:
  - I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.

- que:
  - Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
  ans:
  - You look like an eighties rock band.

- que:
  - Where is Reed?
  ans:
  - Victor must've taken him.

- que:
  - Now what is up with that?
  ans:
  - The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.

- que:
  - Ben, are you there?
  ans:
  - This is wrong in so many ways.

- que:
  - This place is deluxe. You got cable?
  ans:
  - ...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

- que:
  - A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
  ans:
  - Johnny. SUPERNOVA.

- que:
  - I mean, you feel a little feverish.
  ans:
  - And where do we think we're going?

- que:
  - What is that thing?
  ans:
  - I think that thing is Ben.

- que:
  - Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
  ans:
  - Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.

- que:
  - Is that what you call it? \"Real\"?
  ans:
  - At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

- que:
  - And if he's not...?
  ans:
  - Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...

- que:
  - Leonard, how's the feed?
  ans:
  - Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.

- que:
  - Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar \"humanizes\" you.
  ans:
  - How's the IPO?

- que:
  - Front page?
  ans:
  - Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.

- que:
  - This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Hilarious.

- que:
  - Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
  ans:
  - Ben did this.

- que:
  - Ben did this?
  ans:
  - He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.

- que:
  - I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
  ans:
  - What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.

- que:
  - Feeling better?
  ans:
  - Passion.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We need to get past them.

- que:
  - How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
  ans:
  - That's what we're here to find out.

- que:
  - Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - No, I distinctly remember, you door. Ergo...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

- que:
  - But we're...?
  ans:
  - Of course. Of course.

- que:
  - Reed. How close are we to a cure?
  ans:
  - No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.

- que:
  - You were?
  ans:
  - Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

- que:
  - You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
  ans:
  - I gave him twenty.

- que:
  - Why didn't you say something?
  ans:
  - That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.

- que:
  - Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
  ans:
  - I understand the business reasons.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Raising the shields.

- que:
  - Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
  ans:
  - If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.

- que:
  - Skeptical...?
  ans:
  - Medical's ready.

- que:
  - Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
  ans:
  - The less time, the better.

- que:
  - I know that. But what's the maximum?
  ans:
  - In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.

- que:
  - What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
  ans:
  - That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...

- que:
  - What're you getting at?
  ans:
  - Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.

- que:
  - Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
  ans:
  - I'd hold that off awhile.

- que:
  - Benes... What the devil happened?
  ans:
  - The Other Side got to him.

- que:
  - How bad off is he?
  ans:
  - Brain injury.

- que:
  - -- and why we need you.
  ans:
  - Before or after what he wanted to tell you?

- que:
  - What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
  ans:
  - Wish I knew why.

- que:
  - But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
  ans:
  - We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.

- que:
  - His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
  ans:
  - No question of her loyalty.

- que:
  - I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this ?
  ans:
  - .

- que:
  - Say that again?
  ans:
  - General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.

- que:
  - You mean  going along?
  ans:
  - As part of the Crew.

- que:
  - Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
  ans:
  - Just one, General...

- que:
  - Where can I get a cab back to town?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.

- que:
  - Can't remember?... What do you mean?
  ans:
  - He's blanked out on that one particular point.

- que:
  - And no matter what happens, you're to take orders  from Dr. Michaels, understand?
  ans:
  - Listen...the Heart.

- que:
  - But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
  ans:
  - We'll know -- in the next breath...

- que:
  - Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
  ans:
  - Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.

- que:
  - What is it? Anything wrong?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.

- que:
  - Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.

- que:
  - Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
  ans:
  - We're pushing oxygen today.

- que:
  - Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - A great deal more than that, I believe...
  ans:
  - Shouldn't you answer that?

- que:
  - Such as?
  ans:
  - Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...

- que:
  - What gives you that idea?
  ans:
  - That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.

- que:
  - As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy. I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
  ans:
  - You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing -- against all that force.

- que:
  - Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
  ans:
  - I've done all I could with the laser.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - The Breath of God...

- que:
  - You mean Inner Space is endless?
  ans:
  - Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.

- que:
  - Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me they're refueling...

- que:
  - Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
  ans:
  - No, there's no other way.

- que:
  - Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
  ans:
  - Yes... We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.

- que:
  - How does it look, Doctor?
  ans:
  - If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...

- que:
  - The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
  ans:
  - We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.

- que:
  - At an operation?
  ans:
  - Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --

- que:
  - How are you, Miss Peterson?
  ans:
  - About forty miles an hour.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.

- que:
  - If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
  ans:
  - Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.

- que:
  - Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
  ans:
  - Well, we better get on with it.

- que:
  - Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
  ans:
  - Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.

- que:
  - Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
  ans:
  - Send the following message...

- que:
  - I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
  ans:
  - You have no right to blame Duval --

- que:
  - No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
  ans:
  - Two in a row?

- que:
  - Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
  ans:
  - How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?

- que:
  - I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you.

- que:
  - Where we going?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.

- que:
  - May I?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - What'd you do that for?
  ans:
  - I'm married.

- que:
  - Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - Atomic fuel?
  ans:
  - Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.

- que:
  - If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
  ans:
  - That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.

- que:
  - Any reserve air?
  ans:
  - Enough to breathe, but that's all.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...

- que:
  - What is it, Skipper?
  ans:
  - We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.

- que:
  - Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
  ans:
  - I could use a lawnmower...

- que:
  - Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts -- --from up there?
  ans:
  - On the Repeater.

- que:
  - Was there any damage?
  ans:
  - Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.

- que:
  - ...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
  ans:
  - Unghh... oh, geez...

- que:
  - Can I see your license and registration please?
  ans:
  - Certainly.

- que:
  - What's this, sir?
  ans:
  - That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.

- que:
  - Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Few munce.

- que:
  - ...What're you talking about?
  ans:
  - Or your fucking wife, you know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We stop at Pancakes Hause.

- que:
  - ...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
  ans:
  - I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - ...Would it kill you to say something?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.

- que:
  - You want your own wife kidnapped?
  ans:
  - Personal matters.

- que:
  - ...Blood has been shed.
  ans:
  - ...Who's Jean?

- que:
  - What the heck d'ya mean?
  ans:
  - Three people. In Brainerd.

- que:
  - ...The heck d'ya mean?
  ans:
  - End a April.

- que:
  - Any others?
  ans:
  - This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.

- que:
  - You have children?
  ans:
  - Both of these.

- que:
  - Mr. Mohra?
  ans:
  - Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.

- que:
  - What'd this guy look like anyways?
  ans:
  - Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.

- que:
  - Uh-huh - in what way?
  ans:
  - Just a general way.

- que:
  - No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
  ans:
  - The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.

- que:
  - Uh-huh... A what?
  ans:
  - Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.

- que:
  - Where you girls from?
  ans:
  - Chaska.

- que:
  - In what way?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Just funny-looking.

- que:
  - Can you be any more specific?
  ans:
  - I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.

- que:
  - Was he funny-looking apart from that?
  ans:
  - Yah.

- que:
  - So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
  ans:
  - No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.

- que:
  - Oh, yah?
  ans:
  - LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.

- que:
  - Yah?
  ans:
  - Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.

- que:
  - The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
  ans:
  - You know what a disparity is?

- que:
  - ...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.

- que:
  - Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
  ans:
  - No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.

- que:
  - Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
  ans:
  - You bet.

- que:
  - Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
  ans:
  - It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see.

- que:
  - What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
  ans:
  - No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.

- que:
  - What... What is it all about?
  ans:
  - Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.

- que:
  - ...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
  ans:
  - Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.

- que:
  - ...Brainerd?
  ans:
  - Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.

- que:
  - Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
  ans:
  - No. No, ma'am.

- que:
  - So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
  ans:
  - The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

- que:
  - ... I'm sorry, sir?
  ans:
  - Ma'am, I answered your question. I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...

- que:
  - Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
  ans:
  - Yah, real good.

- que:
  - Yah, real good. How you doin'?
  ans:
  - Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.

- que:
  - All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
  ans:
  - Well... yah.

- que:
  - Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
  ans:
  - Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

- que:
  - Well, what do ya mean?
  ans:
  - Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..

- que:
  - ...Yah.
  ans:
  - What the - how's Jean?

- que:
  - ...Dad?
  ans:
  - It's okay, Scotty.

- que:
  - Shep said you'd be here at 7,30. What gives, man?
  ans:
  - Shep said 8,30.

- que:
  - Ya got the car?
  ans:
  - Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.

- que:
  - Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
  ans:
  - Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.

- que:
  - ...Dad?
  ans:
  - Yah.

- que:
  - ...Is everything okay?
  ans:
  - Yah.

- que:
  - Are you calling Stan?
  ans:
  - Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.

- que:
  - Whatcha watchin' there?
  ans:
  - Norstars.

- que:
  - ...Who they playin'?
  ans:
  - OOOoooh! His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.

- que:
  - Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
  ans:
  - You told me about it.

- que:
  - Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
  ans:
  - Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.

- que:
  - No kiddin'?
  ans:
  - Stan and I're okay.

- que:
  - It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
  ans:
  - All the more reason! I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.

- que:

  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - Oh...

- que:
  - Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
  ans:
  - Yah, that's a good one.

- que:
  - Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
  ans:
  - Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.

- que:
  - Oh, yah?
  ans:
  - ...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.

- que:
  - Gotta go?
  ans:
  - Yah.

- que:
  - Yah, yah, course I remember. How are ya? What time is it?
  ans:
  - Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven. I hope I dint wake you.

- que:
  - Well, how the heck are ya?
  ans:
  - Okay, ya know. Okay.

- que:
  - Yah - how are you doon?
  ans:
  - Just a Diet Coke.

- que:
  - Oh, yah, a long time ago.
  ans:
  - You're livin' in Edina, then?

- que:
  - Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda? She was a year behind us.
  ans:
  - Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?

- que:
  - I think I remember Linda, yah. She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
  ans:
  - And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.

  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Norm?
  ans:
  - Linda.

- que:
  - Linda Cooksey?
  ans:
  - No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year. Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.

- que:
  - Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.

- que:
  - Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
  ans:
  - Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.

- que:
  - Yah?
  ans:
  - Prowler needs a jump.

- que:
  - You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - ...How's the paintin' goin'?
  ans:
  - Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.

- que:
  - Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
  ans:
  - Oh, fine.

- que:
  - Not on your feet too much?
  ans:
  - No, no.

- que:
  - You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
  ans:
  - Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.

- que:
  - Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
  ans:
  - Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.

- que:
  - They announced it?
  ans:
  - Yah.

- que:
  - ...So?
  ans:
  - Three-cent stamp.

- que:
  - Your mallard?
  ans:
  - Yah.

- que:
  - And his wife?
  ans:
  - She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.

- que:
  - Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
  ans:
  - His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.

- que:
  - Right, right.
  ans:
  - Where's Tyler?

- que:
  - He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
  ans:
  - What... ?

- que:
  - I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me?
  ans:
  - Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.

- que:
  - Bob. I'm okay. How are you?
  ans:
  - Better than I've ever been in my life.

- que:
  - Really, what's that?
  ans:
  - The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...

- que:
  - After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything.
  ans:
  - You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?

- que:
  - Have you finished those reports?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is that your blood?
  ans:
  - Some of it, yes.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.

- que:
  - Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do?
  ans:
  - We need to talk.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - No, I wasn't aware...

- que:
  - Does this sound strange to you?
  ans:
  - Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - It means it was homemade.

- que:
  - Who do you think could've done this?
  ans:
  - I'll ask the questions, son.

- que:
  - Can't you give me something?
  ans:
  - Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.

- que:
  - Go ahead. I'll expose you.
  ans:
  - Practicing what?

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.

- que:
  - A year? How'd you manage that?
  ans:
  - Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Look, I can't cry with a faker present.

- que:
  - You're kidding.
  ans:
  - Please. Can't we do something... ?

- que:
  - I don't know -- am I?
  ans:
  - I'll take the parasites.

- que:
  - That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?
  ans:
  - We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.

- que:
  - Should we?
  ans:
  - In case we want to switch nights.

- que:
  - How did you find me?
  ans:
  - The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - It's for men.

- que:
  - Like testicular cancer?
  ans:
  - Look, this is a bad time...

- que:
  - I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
  ans:
  - I'm just on my way out...

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.

- que:
  - Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any?
  ans:
  - No, thanks.

- que:
  - Where? Here?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - There?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - Feel anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You feel nothing?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups?
  ans:
  - Chloe's dead.

- que:
  - Do you care?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Hear what?
  ans:
  - That... sawing and hammering.

- que:
  - Have we been talking too long? Must we change the subject?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is this? Who did this?
  ans:
  - ... A person.

- que:
  - Why would you get bent if I asked?
  ans:
  - Let go of me... Leave me alone.

- que:
  - Can I come in?
  ans:
  - He's not here.

- que:
  - Answer the question!
  ans:
  - We've just lost cabin pressure.

- que:
  - What is wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Say my name.

- que:
  - Say my name! What's my name!?
  ans:
  - Whatever. I'll take my food to go...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city...

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - I can't let myself see where you're going. Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...

- que:
  - What happened... ?
  ans:
  - Don't ask.

- que:
  - Who did this to you?
  ans:
  - I did, I think. But, I'm okay... I'm fine...

- que:
  - Who's this?
  ans:
  - Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.

- que:
  - I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick up my phone. What's up?
  ans:
  - Yes... it's a test.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.

- que:
  - Is this part of the test?
  ans:
  - You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir. Tyler Durden.

- que:
  - Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
  ans:
  - My suitcase was vibrating?

- que:
  - Tyler Durden.
  ans:
  - Pardon me?

- que:
  - No, supply oxygen?
  ans:
  - Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - I mean -- for a living.

- que:
  - Thank you.
  ans:
  - Why? So you can say, \"Oh, that's what you do.\" -- And be a smug little shit about it?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Being clever.

- que:
  - I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
  ans:
  - But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.

- que:
  - What list?
  ans:
  - The \"now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again\" list. That list.

- que:
  - Don't I?
  ans:
  - Do what you like.

- que:
  - A hotel?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
  ans:
  - I don't follow...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - You called me so you could have a place to stay.

- que:
  - Can I stay at your place?
  ans:
  - Yes, you can.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

- que:
  - Why would anyone want this shitty job?
  ans:
  - It affords him other interesting opportunities.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.

- que:
  - Where do you want it? In the face?
  ans:
  - Surprise me.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - Strange.

- que:
  - Call what off?
  ans:
  - The fight.

- que:
  - What fight?
  ans:
  - This fight, pussy.

- que:
  - Anyone?
  ans:
  - Anyone.

- que:
  - My boss, probably. Who would you fight?
  ans:
  - My dad. No question.

- que:
  - What car?
  ans:
  - I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.

- que:
  - What are you reading?
  ans:
  - Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.

- que:
  - Alive or dead?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter.

- que:
  - Hemingway. You?
  ans:
  - Shatner. William Shatner.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

- que:
  - Unbelievable, huh?
  ans:
  - He was obviously able to handle it.

- que:
  - I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
  ans:
  - No. Not at all.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm sure.

- que:
  - You're okay with this?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - That was three times you promised.
  ans:
  - Promise?

- que:
  - You want to finish her off?
  ans:
  - Uh... nah...

- que:
  - Don't mention me.
  ans:
  - Huh?

- que:
  - What is this place?
  ans:
  - A liposuction clinic.

- que:
  - Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - It isn't... ?
  ans:
  - We don't need him...

- que:
  - ... Marla ... ?
  ans:
  - Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.

- que:
  - Yeah. Where you headed?
  ans:
  - Work. Going to work.

- que:
  - What... ?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Do what you like.

- que:
  - Newcastle? Did you start that one?
  ans:
  - I thought you did.

- que:
  - What are we doing?
  ans:
  - Homework assignment.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Tyler...

- que:
  - An expired community college student ID card. What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
  ans:
  - I asked you what you studied.

- que:
  - Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
  ans:
  - I felt like destroying something beautiful.

- que:
  - Something on your mind?
  ans:
  - Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.

- que:
  - Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean.

- que:
  - What do you want? A statement of purpose... ?
  ans:
  - This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What's this all about, Tyler?
  ans:
  - And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.

- que:
  - Why do people think I'm you?
  ans:
  - You broke your promise. You talked to her about me.

- que:
  - Why did you do that?
  ans:
  - Answer me, Tyler.

- que:
  - People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
  ans:
  - Why do people think anything?

- que:
  - What are you talking about... ?
  ans:
  - Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...

- que:
  - What... what are you saying?
  ans:
  - It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...

- que:
  - Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
  ans:
  - What about them? They're lunatics.

- que:
  - What about Marla?
  ans:
  - She's... you... you're fucking her.

- que:
  - ...go through with this? What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to...

- que:
  - ...stop me?
  ans:
  - I'm not going...

- que:
  - Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
  ans:
  - The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.

- que:
  - Green? Did you say green?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Fuck your struggle. I want out.
  ans:
  - Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan?

- que:
  - You want out?
  ans:
  - I quit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Defuse the bomb.

- que:
  - Defuse the bomb?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can't you call it off... ?
  ans:
  - It's out of our hands. This is it.

- que:
  - What the fuck -- ?
  ans:
  - Paraffin.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb.

- que:
  - Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
  ans:
  - You need me.

- que:
  - Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
  ans:
  - Not my mouth. Our mouth.

- que:
  - Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
  ans:
  - It's the only way to get rid of you...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Appreciate something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look at me...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My eyes are open.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Maintenance.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

- que:
  - Robert Paulson?
  ans:
  - We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

- que:
  - He don't own this place, I do. How much money's he getting for this?
  ans:
  - There is no money.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - It's free to all.

- que:
  - Ain't that something?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - How'd you know?
  ans:
  - They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die.

- que:
  - Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
  ans:
  - Yesssss...

- que:
  - \"Stuff.\" Were the mid-terms hard?
  ans:
  - Biology, mostly.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I... I don't know...

- que:
  - What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
  ans:
  - Animals.

- que:
  - Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
  ans:
  - I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.

- que:
  - Yeah, how?
  ans:
  - I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.

- que:
  - It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
  ans:
  - Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.

- que:
  - What list?
  ans:
  - Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.

- que:
  - The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
  ans:
  - That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...

- que:
  - How can you say that? What kind of monster are you?
  ans:
  - The second one just dies. A 16 year old kid.

- que:
  - You were there?
  ans:
  - I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...

- que:
  - Please, what else could it mean?
  ans:
  - So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.

- que:
  - No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
  ans:
  - What about that?

- que:
  - What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
  ans:
  - Six duds in a row.

- que:
  - This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.

- que:
  - What did you see? What am I looking for?
  ans:
  - No, it's not here. This one was different. More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Speed up.

- que:
  - I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
  ans:
  - No! It can't be.

- que:
  - Should we knock?
  ans:
  - He probably already knows we're coming.

- que:
  - She had the baby?
  ans:
  - Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers.

- que:
  - What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice?
  ans:
  - I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.

- que:
  - Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
  ans:
  - Blow me.

- que:
  - Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
  ans:
  - Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimberly.

- que:
  - Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
  ans:
  - Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimmy.

- que:
  - Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. Did you?
  ans:
  - Of course not. That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.

- que:
  - No. What's this about?
  ans:
  - We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going.

- que:
  - What was the fight about?
  ans:
  - Take a guess.

- que:
  - Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
  ans:
  - She did.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.

- que:
  - Yeah, so what happened?
  ans:
  - I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.

- que:
  - What's going on here?
  ans:
  - There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.

- que:
  - Do you remember what triggered it all?
  ans:
  - Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling \"pile up\" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - You mean Alex Browning.

- que:
  - Then you believe all this? That Death is working off a list?
  ans:
  - I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.

- que:
  - New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.

- que:
  - It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
  ans:
  - Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.

- que:
  - Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
  ans:
  - Guys, let's not panic. Isabella's safe.

- que:
  - I wasn't worried about us.
  ans:
  - How do you know?

- que:
  - Shouldn't we pull over?
  ans:
  - No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.

- que:
  - I don't...what if I made a mistake?
  ans:
  - Impossible. She was on the onramp.

- que:
  - Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.

- que:
  - Want me to drive?
  ans:
  - No, I'm good.

- que:
  - This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
  ans:
  - Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
  ans:
  - I...I don't know.

- que:
  - And you're gonna die after me, right?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
  ans:
  - Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia.

- que:
  - Fix-A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace?
  ans:
  - I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.

- que:
  - Hey, Dad. What's up?
  ans:
  - Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.

- que:
  - What feeling?
  ans:
  - That it's not over yet.

- que:
  - Who am I, David Blane?
  ans:
  - You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside.

- que:
  - You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
  ans:
  - You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.

- que:
  - I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
  ans:
  - He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.

- que:
  - How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
  ans:
  - Thirty-nine.

- que:
  - Remember the gate number?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Remember the departure time?
  ans:
  - Like... 4,25.

- que:
  - I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
  ans:
  - No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.

- que:
  - Why do you think I was hiding?
  ans:
  - Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.

- que:
  - Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
  ans:
  - No!

- que:
  - And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
  ans:
  - C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?

- que:
  - Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
  ans:
  - Me, too. But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.

- que:
  - Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
  ans:
  - Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?

- que:
  - Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
  ans:
  - No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.

- que:
  - Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
  ans:
  - His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.

- que:
  - Design?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry we broke in.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Terry's name should be on this wall.

- que:
  - So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
  ans:
  - That's right, buddy.

- que:
  - I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did. They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week. Got a smoke?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You mean the snake?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's not hard once you get the hang of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.

- que:
  - Really? How come he didn't take me?
  ans:
  - Maybe because you're shot in the leg.

- que:
  - Star Wars?
  ans:
  - ... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...

- que:
  - Ever do this from a jet?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Gettin' old, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Second set. Let's go.

- que:
  - Yeah. Why not?
  ans:
  - You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.

- que:
  - You read me, Brewer?
  ans:
  - Read you.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Keep it down, man. I got problems.

- que:
  - What do you call that?
  ans:
  - Batteries not included.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.

- que:
  - That's it? Some C-4, a map and a knife?
  ans:
  - There's a compass in the handle.

- que:
  - You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's this stuff on the rice?
  ans:
  - Fermented fish sauce.

- que:
  - Who cares? Let's just do it and get out. Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok. Know what I mean?
  ans:
  - We'll check it out.

- que:
  - Brewer. Does a jet make noise?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - What's she saying?
  ans:
  - She likes you. Says you're dinky- dau.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Powerful warrior.

- que:
  - Yeah. Dinky-dau, that's me. Hey, Co. You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
  ans:
  - These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.

- que:
  - How you doing, Brewer?
  ans:
  - I need a vacation.

- que:
  - American?
  ans:
  - Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing.

- que:
  - Are they going to torture us?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What... whattaya do?
  ans:
  - Gawd, you look awful.

- que:
  - You comin'?
  ans:
  - Hold your pantyhose. Here, gimme a hand.

- que:
  - Can you handle the door gun?
  ans:
  - Duck soup.

- que:
  - Brewer! You know what that thing's packing?
  ans:
  - It's a Soviet MIL MI-24. Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...

- que:
  - How much we got left in that minigun?
  ans:
  - I'm Rambo. This is Brewer. Her name is Co.

- que:
  - You really got a Masters Degree?
  ans:
  - Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.

- que:
  - How do we get upriver?
  ans:
  - I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there. Empty for years.

- que:
  - Where did you find this clown?
  ans:
  - I thought he was with you.

- que:
  - Spooks?
  ans:
  - Intelligence work.

- que:
  - Where's Nguyen now? What city?
  ans:
  - Huntington Beach, California.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad.

- que:
  - Why'd they want us?
  ans:
  - They heard about escaped prisoner on radio. Make deal. More than we pay.

- que:
  - Christ. How'd you get here?
  ans:
  - Took bus, most of way. I knew you would come here.

- que:
  - And how'd you sneak up like that?
  ans:
  - Carefully. Don't want to get shot by you. Bad karma. Anyway, you need me.

- que:
  - I do?
  ans:
  - You think you are... .

- que:
  - Yes you can.
  ans:
  - You try get across Laos? Get to Thailand?

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Minigun. Come on. Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.

- que:
  - I'm authorized to get you out of here. I thought that's what you wanted.
  ans:
  - It doesn't hurt. Why doesn't it hurt?

- que:
  - What's the job?
  ans:
  - Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - We like you. At least the computer at Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service record. Area familiarity.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
  ans:
  - Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two assault team will get them out.

- que:
  - We just take pictures?
  ans:
  - Don't look so disappointed. It should be hairy enough... even for you.

- que:
  - All this is for us?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Um... actually, no. It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He... took it.

- que:
  - How long have you been setting up?
  ans:
  - About 22 hours on site.

- que:
  - How long before you're fully on line?
  ans:
  - Couple hours. Let me buy you a coffee.

- que:
  - POWs? I don't know. But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?
  ans:
  - It's not necessary.

- que:
  - This mission was a scam from the word go?
  ans:
  - Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.

- que:
  - So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
  ans:
  - Of course not. You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.

- que:
  - Who're you?
  ans:
  - I could a couple of days ago. Gonna be... stiff.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - De Fravio. Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.

- que:
  - Mind if I sit down?
  ans:
  - I hear you're not enjoying it here.

- que:
  - Am I out of here?
  ans:
  - There were treating me like a headcase.

- que:
  - This your stuff?
  ans:
  - That's it. My life.

- que:
  - What did you want?
  ans:
  - You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.

- que:
  - This just occurred to somebody, now?
  ans:
  - Listen up. You two are married as of now. Get used to it.

- que:
  - But now it's free, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well did you or didn't you?
  ans:
  - Yes! They'll be in soon.

- que:
  - I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
  ans:
  - Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.

- que:
  - Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - You threw him out?
  ans:
  - My parents were divorced.

- que:
  - Do I look like I have someone special?
  ans:
  - Well, there's nobody special!

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Meeting ... people.

- que:
  - I don't understand you. What is the problem?
  ans:
  - I'm paying you.

- que:
  - Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... She didn't even look at him.
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - Got any more bread crust?
  ans:
  - I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous. It's the only reason to go out with a bum.

- que:
  - Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
  ans:
  - You're surprised!... But I guess I just never met the right guy. Whatta gonna do?

- que:
  - Well, it's funny! Whatta want from me?
  ans:
  - It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.

- que:
  - Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.

- que:
  - I can't tell you how distraught I was. All night long. What the hell happened?
  ans:
  - I was attacked.

- que:
  - Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
  ans:
  - ... So... where did you sleep last night?

- que:
  - You still believe in God?
  ans:
  - ... You have a little... uh... something on your face...

- que:
  - I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
  ans:
  - You didn't kill anybody. Stop.

- que:
  - Lydia?! Lydia who!?
  ans:
  - I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.

- que:
  - The moron?
  ans:
  - He's not a moron.

- que:
  - And who's Lydia?
  ans:
  - Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...

- que:
  - Well, what the hell does that mean?
  ans:
  - Hello....congratulations.

- que:
  - He just needs some clothes?
  ans:
  - Well talk back. He won't bite you.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.

- que:
  - You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
  ans:
  - Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, \"some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores\".

- que:
  - So what's going on? Who's Lou again?
  ans:
  - My agent. I called my agent.

- que:
  - Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin...
  ans:
  - You're kidding! What did he say?

- que:
  - ... What?... You don't want to commute?
  ans:
  - No, it's not... Come here...

- que:
  - \"I'm an incredible woman?\" What is this, a death sentence?
  ans:
  - No, I... I think we should talk about this.

- que:
  - You want to talk? Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
  ans:
  - No... it's just...

- que:
  - Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
  ans:
  - Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.

- que:
  - So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
  ans:
  - I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - I'm... just looking for Parry...

- que:
  - Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
  ans:
  - A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.

- que:
  - Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
  ans:
  - Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME......Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...

- que:
  - Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day. Are you going to be all right?
  ans:
  - Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine... ....Thanks...You're a gem.

- que:
  - Good. You believe this drunk?
  ans:
  - .....Me neither.

- que:
  - About dinner as a concept or about dinner with... Raoul?
  ans:
  - You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.

- que:
  - ... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?
  ans:
  - Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.

- que:
  - I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some?
  ans:
  - No, I have to work.

- que:
  - Yeah? Who is this?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
  ans:
  - Huh-huh.

- que:
  - Which ones?
  ans:
  - All of them... Which means you have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.

- que:
  - Well, I don't understand. What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
  ans:
  - A list.

- que:
  - Well there.... What's the difference?
  ans:
  - Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.

- que:
  - Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
  ans:

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...

- que:
  - Free?
  ans:
  - Yes. They're free.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Well, since you're a member, we could...

- que:
  - Tonight! How's tonight?
  ans:
  - God, I have no idea. She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea. I'll call her.

- que:
  - This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
  ans:
  - Please don't hurt me?

- que:
  - Have I died?
  ans:
  - Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...

- que:
  - My name is Parry.
  ans:
  - Where am I?

- que:
  - The Little People?
  ans:
  - They said you're The One.

- que:
  - I'm not... Now, where are those shoes...
  ans:
  - I'm the one what?

- que:
  - ... Do you know who I am?
  ans:
  - Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.

- que:
  - A quest?
  ans:
  - But I need help and they sent you.

- que:
  - Him...?
  ans:
  - God... I'm the janitor of God.

- que:
  - The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
  ans:
  - Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why did you do that?
  ans:
  - Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.

- que:
  - That's O.K.
  ans:
  - Fifty dollars?

- que:
  - Can I take you to lunch?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.

- que:
  - You really want to help me?
  ans:
  - Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.

- que:
  - So what? You going to help me?
  ans:
  - Parry...

- que:
  - Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do...do you want to stay here?
  ans:
  - It's such a great song.

- que:
  - .....What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.

- que:
  - Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
  ans:
  - In a bar called Hellfire.

- que:
  - What are the other reasons?
  ans:
  - ...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - OWW...MAN...

- que:
  - Parry Parry?
  ans:
  - No just Parry.

  - Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
  ans:
  - How about the \"Hell Merchants\"?

- que:
  - Got any Ethel Merman?
  ans:
  - ... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.

- que:
  - How do you know him?
  ans:
  - We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.

- que:
  - What do you do - for a living I mean?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.

- que:
  - What are we about to do?
  ans:
  - Well... you're walking me home. I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...

- que:
  - Oh no, I want to. I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make?
  ans:
  - You're married.

- que:
  - See, I told you it was him... Your name's Donnie something, right?
  ans:
  - I leave it to you.

- que:
  - Twinky?
  ans:
  - Yeah, 'cause she's so \"twinky\"...

- que:
  - A wig?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.

- que:
  - Out where?
  ans:
  - You can sing the song.

- que:
  - Is it my turn again?
  ans:
  - Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...

- que:
  - I did, didn' I, El?
  ans:
  - You got another ball comin'.

- que:
  - You just going to sit there?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you love me, Bobby?
  ans:
  - I'll be gone two or three weeks.

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is what you?
  ans:
  - You're depressed that I come along.

- que:
  - Well, is that a happy face I see?
  ans:
  - Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.

- que:
  - So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
  ans:
  - If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.

- que:
  - Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
  ans:
  - Sure...

- que:
  - This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Just finish eating.

- que:
  - Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
  ans:
  - It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.

- que:
  - I don't, huh?
  ans:
  - Bobby...

- que:
  - I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
  ans:
  - No.

  - Sure you don't want anything?
  ans:
  - Fill it up.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Palm Apodaca.

  ans:
  - Washington.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Alaska.

- que:
  - Alaska? Are you on vacation?
  ans:
  - You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.

- que:
  - I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
  ans:
  - Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.

- que:
  - I didn't get it, did I?
  ans:
  - No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.

- que:
  - No. How much do I owe you?
  ans:
  - Five'll do it.

- que:
  - What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
  ans:
  - No. We have tomatoes.

  ans:
  - I don't make the rules.

- que:
  - One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
  ans:
  - Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.

- que:
  - Am I on TV?
  ans:
  - She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.

- que:
  - Would you tell her Bobby's here?
  ans:
  - Oh my goodness... Bobby...

- que:
  - You know who it once belonged to?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Everybody still up on the Island?
  ans:
  - Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.

- que:
  - Who's Van Oost?
  ans:
  - Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.

- que:
  - Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
  ans:
  - Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Daddy's very ill.

- que:
  - I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
  ans:
  - Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...

- que:
  - How long have you been staying here?
  ans:
  - A couple of months.

- que:
  - I mean, you think I'm that happy?
  ans:
  - No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.

- que:
  - Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
  ans:
  - No, I don't really think you're a freak.

- que:
  - What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
  ans:
  - Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...

- que:
  - Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - With applesauce?
  ans:
  - No, thanks...

- que:
  - I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
  ans:
  - I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.

- que:
  - Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
  ans:
  - Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

- que:
  - Where is she, anyway?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...

- que:
  - You were going without saying goodbye?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.

- que:
  - But what about me?
  ans:
  - I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.

- que:
  - What have you been doing since then?
  ans:
  - What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.

- que:
  - And you no longer play at all?
  ans:
  - Hello...

- que:
  - Swimming?
  ans:
  - Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.

- que:
  - Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Let me give it some thought.

- que:
  - Then after that?
  ans:
  - After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.

- que:
  - Is that funny?
  ans:
  - It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.

- que:
  - You had no inner feeling?
  ans:
  - None.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - At being a fake.

- que:
  - It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...

- que:
  - Some bath oil?
  ans:
  - I don't find your language that charming.

- que:
  - Serious, that's what's important to you?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's what's important to me...

- que:
  - That's what you said?
  ans:
  - Something witty and devastating like that.

- que:
  - As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... How are you?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Is he?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think I could.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.

- que:
  - I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - I have to talk to you.

- que:
  - Will you let me talk to you, please?
  ans:
  - I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.

- que:
  - And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She's tremendously gifted, this girl.

- que:
  - Is she?
  ans:
  - I hope you feel at home, Robert. I'm really glad you're here.

- que:
  - You sure you should be playing, Carl?
  ans:
  - What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.

- que:
  - I'm not aware of it. Like what?
  ans:
  - Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.

- que:
  - See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
  ans:
  - At game, Carl.

- que:
  - I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
  ans:
  - Oh, for chrissakes...

- que:
  - Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
  ans:
  - Robert, I think you better just...

- que:
  - Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
  ans:
  - No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...

- que:
  - You've been staying in a motel all this time?
  ans:
  - I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.

- que:
  - What kind of doggy is that?
  ans:
  - It's a Borzoi.

- que:
  - What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
  ans:
  - No, I wouldn't.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.

- que:
  - Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
  ans:
  - If you want to call it that.

- que:
  - Aaron, how you doin'?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Just get the fuck outta here.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
  ans:
  - There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.

- que:
  - Is it true?
  ans:
  - I told you, no. I'm not that type.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:

  - Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
  ans:
  - I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.

- que:
  - Whadja wanna see me about?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to see you.

- que:
  - So you got a girl?

  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - I think by Twenty-two.

- que:
  - Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
  ans:
  - For real?

  ans:
  - Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.

  ans:
  - Positive.

- que:
  - So what do you want with her anyway?
  ans:
  - I'm a good friend of hers.

  ans:
  - Nothing.

  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You gotta girLfrLend?
  ans:
  - I know how ta get him back if you want.

- que:
  - I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
  ans:
  - God I admire you.

- que:
  - By the way, what kind of name is Poon?
  ans:
  - Comanche Indian.

- que:
  - So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
  ans:
  - We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.

- que:
  - Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
  ans:
  - Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.

- que:
  - Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
  ans:
  - That's what he said.

- que:
  - He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
  ans:
  - I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.

- que:
  - Creasy, how old are you?
  ans:
  - Nineteen.

- que:
  - Hey, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Hey you're really nuts.

- que:
  - What? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I busted their window, they didn't do anything.

- que:
  - You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve. So what's your name?
  ans:
  - I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
  ans:
  - Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.

- que:
  - We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
  ans:
  - I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.

- que:
  - Can I ask anybody now?
  ans:
  - Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.

- que:
  - What'll it be Fletch?
  ans:
  - Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.

- que:
  - Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
  ans:
  - Not a prayer.

- que:
  - Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
  ans:
  - Greetings, everyone.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.

- que:
  - So where do you know Alan from?
  ans:
  - We play tennis at the club.

- que:
  - Really. The California Racquet Club?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
  ans:
  - That's Babar.

- que:
  - Two bs?
  ans:
  - One. B-a-b-a-r.

- que:
  - Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't have any.

- que:
  - No children?
  ans:
  - No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.

- que:
  - Your aunt?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Smith.

- que:
  - Well, which one?
  ans:
  - Margaret.

- que:
  - Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- Ever serve time?
  ans:
  - Breathe easy...

- que:
  - Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
  ans:
  - Just relax.

- que:
  - Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
  ans:
  - I can't discuss another patient. You know that. Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.

- que:
  - I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.

- que:
  - I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
  ans:
  - Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.

- que:
  - So what do you figure?
  ans:
  - No idea.

- que:
  - No idea at all?
  ans:
  - Okay. Some idea.

- que:
  - Like when?
  ans:
  - Like tonight.

- que:
  - No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
  ans:
  - I think Id rather have drugs.

- que:
  - Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?
  ans:
  - Jesus.

- que:
  - What, the heat here?
  ans:
  - Affirmative.

- que:
  - The two surfer boys?
  ans:
  - Affirmative.

- que:
  - Thought so. What for?
  ans:
  - For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.

- que:
  - I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
  ans:
  - You gonna nail the chief?

- que:
  - You don't have a piece of the action?
  ans:
  - Noooo. Free snort. That's it.

- que:
  - You find the source?
  ans:
  - Gum thought Brazil.

- que:
  - It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
  ans:
  - Nothing. They're still there.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - You're in the Records Room.

- que:
  - Can I get you something?
  ans:
  - Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.

- que:
  - Is there anything particular you're looking for?
  ans:
  - Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - What about breaking and entering? Are you wearing anything under that?
  ans:
  - I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.

- que:
  - I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
  ans:
  - Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Read this, please.

- que:
  - And what was that?
  ans:
  - How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.

- que:
  - I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
  ans:
  - Whoops.

- que:
  - Harry S. Truman?
  ans:
  - My parents were great fans of the former President.

- que:
  - Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
  ans:
  - Come on in.

- que:
  - Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
  ans:
  - Check.

- que:
  - Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
  ans:
  - Oh, about ten days ago.

- que:
  - Ten days ago?
  ans:
  - That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.

- que:
  - Isn't that nice. Since when?
  ans:
  - Since he moved to L.A.

- que:
  - What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
  ans:
  - Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.

- que:
  - Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Then he has.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around. Don't go back in there.

- que:
  - I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
  ans:
  - You sure did.

- que:
  - John Ultramalensky, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - No problem.

- que:
  - Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
  ans:
  - Its okay. The cops did it.

- que:
  - Fletch?
  ans:
  - Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.

- que:
  - Why are they after you?
  ans:
  - Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.

- que:
  - Where does the Chief get the drugs?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.

- que:
  - Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
  ans:
  - That's Brazil.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because we can't.

- que:
  - Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
  ans:
  - I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.

- que:
  - Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
  ans:
  - It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.

- que:
  - Why don't you try suicide?
  ans:
  - My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.

- que:
  - So why pick me?
  ans:
  - You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.

- que:
  - Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
  ans:
  - I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.

- que:
  - Wouldn't they normally be locked?
  ans:
  - Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.

- que:
  - Precisely. Are you a good shot?
  ans:
  - What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.

- que:
  - Do you have a passport?
  ans:
  - Sure, all drifters do.

- que:
  - Take it where?
  ans:
  - LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.

- que:
  - Where am I going?
  ans:
  - Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.

- que:
  - They serve dinner on the flight?
  ans:
  - It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.

- que:
  - You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
  ans:
  - I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.

- que:
  - You sure those doors will be open?
  ans:
  - Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.

- que:
  - Will you kill me?
  ans:
  - Only if you promise not to return me.

- que:
  - Magic' today, huh?
  ans:
  - Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.

- que:
  - Did you hear something?
  ans:
  - Not me.

- que:
  - You doing a story on this guy?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Did you say cops?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I'm sorry?
  ans:
  - His bride. Cute as a button.

- que:
  - Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
  ans:
  - Cute thing.

- que:
  - Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
  ans:
  - Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.

- que:
  - Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
  ans:
  - I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.

- que:
  - Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
  ans:
  - John Ultrarelamensky.

- que:
  - You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
  ans:
  - What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.

- que:
  - Why do you keep doing this?
  ans:
  - I love the outfits.

- que:
  - Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
  ans:
  - Alan's in Utah.

- que:
  - I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
  ans:
  - If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.

- que:
  - What's he doing in Utah?
  ans:
  - None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's John. John... Znhcneelsky.

- que:
  - John Ultramalensky?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
  ans:
  - I ordered lunch.

- que:
  - You ordered it here?
  ans:
  - Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.

- que:
  - Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - All this goes on Underhill's bill?
  ans:
  - I saved his life during the war.

- que:
  - You were in the war?
  ans:
  - No. He was. I got him out.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Depends on the question.

- que:
  - Are you still in love with Alan?
  ans:
  - No. I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.

- que:
  - Why'd you let me in?
  ans:
  - Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.

- que:
  - Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
  ans:
  - Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.

- que:
  - What about his parents?
  ans:
  - He never sees them and I never met them.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Thanks for the great time.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Long story.

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - Why did you do it?

- que:
  - I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
  ans:
  - Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - That's what I want to know.

- que:
  - How do you know about that?
  ans:
  - He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.

- que:
  - Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
  ans:
  - What does all this mean?

- que:
  - Stop it. Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
  ans:
  - I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

- que:
  - Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
  ans:
  - Act natural.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Gail?
  ans:
  - I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.

- que:
  - Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm with the Underhills.

- que:
  - Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
  ans:
  - In her cabana, sir.

- que:
  - Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
  ans:
  - Cabana one.

- que:
  - Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
  ans:
  - I would, actually.

- que:
  - Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.

- que:
  - I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
  ans:
  - I recommend it.

- que:
  - You want I set up?
  ans:
  - No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The door was unlocked.

- que:
  - I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Moved out.

- que:
  - She moved out?
  ans:
  - I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.

- que:
  - What did you want under the bed?
  ans:
  - Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.

- que:
  - No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
  ans:
  - I never read the paper.

- que:
  - Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
  ans:
  - What's the spread on the game tonight?

- que:
  - Why not? Oh shit... really?
  ans:
  - Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.

- que:
  - You broke it? You know the source?
  ans:
  - Practically.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Well, there we're in a gray area.

- que:
  - How gray?
  ans:
  - I'd say charcoal.

- que:
  - I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
  ans:
  - Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God. I hope.

- que:
  - Just give me a hint, all right?
  ans:
  - All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.

- que:
  - Utah?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.

- que:
  - What about finding the source?
  ans:
  - I have some ideas.

- que:
  - Who? Donnie and Marie?
  ans:
  - Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.

- que:
  - How could you call him?
  ans:
  - It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.

- que:
  - What? Who the hell are they?
  ans:
  - This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.

- que:
  - You were going to can me, right?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Not really?
  ans:
  - I was upset.

- que:
  - Jim Swarthout?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
  ans:
  - Frieda's boss.

- que:
  - Who's Frieda?
  ans:
  - My secretary.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.

- que:
  - I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Don't say it. Orange juice?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke?
  ans:
  - Poor taste. I know. Listen, I respect homosexuals. When I was young, my maid was a homosexual. My maid was a homosexual.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Nuthin'.

- que:
  - Did she tell you anything?
  ans:
  - Lots of things. Her favorite yogurt. The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...

- que:
  - Hold that thought. Are we being shot at?
  ans:
  - That was close...

- que:
  - Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
  ans:
  - What did these Vancouver factories do?

- que:
  - G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
  ans:
  - Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?

- que:
  - Fucking Australians! I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
  ans:
  - Let's just declare war on the hellhole. Before they make Crocodile Dundee three.

- que:
  - I love you, too, baby. He wants to meet at six. What time is it now?
  ans:
  - That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...

- que:
  - So what about this watch?
  ans:
  - Keep it. It's your paycheck this month.

- que:
  - You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...

- que:
  - Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
  ans:
  - You going to be okay?

- que:
  - How'd you get this from her?
  ans:
  - You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...

- que:
  - What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
  ans:
  - Contacts.

- que:
  - I don't know, what was the case?
  ans:
  - Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Ah, an obvious choice.

- que:
  - Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
  ans:
  - Johnny's C.D.?

- que:
  - Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?
  ans:
  - C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Three hundred.

- que:
  - Zuzu Petals! Zuzu Petals! Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit? Who killed Johnny Crunch? Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm so scared. Help me.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Give me your gum and grab the wheel.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Peachy.

- que:
  - Why are all these people after me?
  ans:
  - I'm so sure! I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...

- que:
  - Because I know rock-n-roll.
  ans:
  - You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?

- que:
  - No. Who's Art Mooney?
  ans:
  - He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life. Here's our stop...

- que:
  - You didn't ask. Have you ever thought about mousse?
  ans:
  - Zuzu, wake up...

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.

- que:
  - I'm afraid so, you want her?
  ans:
  - Ye-ah.

- que:
  - Why have you come to my planet?
  ans:
  - Ick.

- que:
  - I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job. Shall we?
  ans:
  - Hey. God. You're an asshole.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - There's that question...

- que:
  - So, Zuzu. Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Ford. I'm okay.

- que:
  - Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
  ans:
  - Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

- que:
  - When you going to let me work with you? Why you always fucking with me?
  ans:
  - Why am I what? Excuse me? I catch you saying the F-word again. I'll kill you. That's a fucking promise. Now get the fuck out of here.

- que:
  - Twelve pack?
  ans:
  - This ain't no social call. One hundred bucks. To find my father.

- que:
  - Did he just say what I think he said?
  ans:
  - I've got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.

- que:
  - Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
  ans:
  - Run to the nearest phone and call the police.

- que:
  - Where's my father? Have you even looked?
  ans:
  - Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...

- que:
  - So, did you find my dad?
  ans:
  - Well, I got some good news and some bad news.

- que:
  - What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
  ans:
  - Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk. Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.

- que:
  - Who's my real father, man?
  ans:
  - He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.

- que:
  - What are you running from?
  ans:
  - Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Let me go out like a man.

- que:
  - I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney. Do you know him?
  ans:
  - Well, hello, Ford.

- que:
  - Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
  ans:
  - Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...

- que:
  - And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
  ans:
  - Golly, I'd probably faint.

- que:
  - It's 7,30. You really should get a watch.
  ans:
  - It doesn't have to be like this?

- que:
  - What about Don?
  ans:
  - Kill them. Not quickly.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - When I say 'no,' run for the door.

- que:
  - What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
  ans:
  - Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.

- que:
  - Do you really know everybody in the industry?
  ans:
  - Only on a first name basis.

- que:
  - You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right? Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - So...

- que:
  - What's my name?
  ans:
  - Doyle.

  - What?
  ans:

- que:
  - What about you? Can you stand a toss?
  ans:
  - I'm clean.

  - You don't use shit?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
  ans:
  - No - no.

- que:
  - How's everything?
  ans:
  - Everything is everything.

- que:
  - Boca?
  ans:
  - B.O.C.A.

- que:
  - Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're talkin' about.

- que:
  - Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
  ans:
  - No... yeah...

- que:
  - Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
  ans:
  - Man, I'm clean.

- que:
  - You made three sales to your roaches back there. We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
  ans:
  - Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu. Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli. Henri Devereaux.

- que:
  - Did you pick up the car?
  ans:
  - It is waiting for you in the garage.

- que:
  - Did they follow you?
  ans:
  - I wasn't looking.

- que:
  - Are you having trouble raising the half million?
  ans:
  - Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.

- que:
  - Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
  ans:
  - Si tu veux.

- que:
  - What happens to the schedule?
  ans:
  - We must follow it.

  - But will they?
  ans:

  ans:
  - If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.

- que:
  - What's your story?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.

  - Monica? Who's Monica?
  ans:
  - A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

  - Makin' wine in the basement. He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed. With my own cuffs.

  ans:
  - This is what the tough guys are wearin'. You know I only steal from the best. It's Bonwit Teller.

- que:
  - Just for mistakes of parking?
  ans:
  - No. Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

- que:
  - Why is it called Hellgate?
  ans:
  - The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast. Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.

  ans:
  - Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - It was a crematorium.

  ans:
  - You know what I'm saying.

- que:
  - So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North. You mind I take a shot at him?
  ans:
  - That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.

- que:
  - They around?
  ans:
  - Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad.

- que:
  - Where's the collar, in the cells?
  ans:
  - No, I think he's up in interrogation.

- que:
  - Why haven't they killed the juice?
  ans:
  - Switches are shorted out.

- que:
  - How do we get to the vault door?
  ans:
  - There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.

- que:
  - The game, Graham. The Series?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. Damn. My watch is busted.

- que:
  - I seem nervous, huh?
  ans:
  - Frank. We gotta go back. Frank...

- que:
  - Frank. Hey, man. You alright?
  ans:
  - I'm alright, Gibby.

  - Well, why not a little of the King?
  ans:
  - Damn.

- que:
  - You alright?
  ans:
  - I think I ruined the sauce...again.

- que:
  - What's the matter, Jules? Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
  ans:
  - You didn't marry Donna Reed.

- que:
  - How was your tour?
  ans:
  - The usual.

- que:
  - Did he?
  ans:
  - He did.

- que:
  - Frank...what's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I just wanted to see you.

- que:
  - Where's Johnny?
  ans:
  - I tucked him in at Gordo's.

- que:
  - One in each ear. What would you do without me?
  ans:
  - Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...

- que:
  - Do you know how much I love you?
  ans:
  - There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.

- que:
  - The future guy?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...

- que:
  - What is going on here, Satch? What are those guys doing out there?
  ans:
  - I think you know, Frank.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Let's go. Do us both a favor.

- que:
  - Do you know where I found this?
  ans:
  - 415 Greenwich St. 302. Under the body of a murdered woman.

- que:
  - Uh, huh... Uh, huh. And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
  ans:
  - As nuts as that sounds, yes.

- que:
  - Satch, would you listen to me here. Just you and me. Can I talk to you here, alone?
  ans:
  - Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Frank, please...

- que:
  - You ready?
  ans:
  - Name's John.

- que:
  - Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
  ans:
  - Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.

- que:
  - Where are you transmitting from?
  ans:
  - Queens, New York.

- que:
  - Sorry 'bout that. So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
  ans:
  - I don't really follow baseball anymore.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I got fed up with all the bullshit.

- que:
  - I'm right with you, man. He's got the heart of a lion. Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - The World Series. You called Buford's homer.

- que:
  - This afternoon?

  ans:

  - What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
  ans:

- que:
  - 29 years...?
  ans:
  - What the hell...

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Nothing...I just spilled something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You just burned the desk.

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - That's impossible.

- que:
  - How could this be happening?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Sun spot?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's how Hams work.

  - You sound...ground up...?
  ans:
  - I'm thirty-five years old.

- que:
  - It's really you, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yeah...I think so.

- que:
  - Too busy playin' ball, huh?
  ans:
  - Nah, I gave it up.

- que:
  - You're still my Little Chief, right?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to be, Dad. I'm tyrin'. It's good to hear your voice. I missed you...so much.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I think I'm losing you.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I lost you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I never knew you, Dad.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Fire.

- que:
  - On the job?
  ans:
  - That can't be...that's not gonna happen.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - October 12, 1969.

  - Chief?! Is that you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's me.

- que:

  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm okay. What about you? I want to know. About you. And your mom.

- que:
  - What, Johnny? What is it?
  ans:
  - What it was like when you died in the fire...

- que:
  - Are you alright\"?
  ans:
  - Something happened, something...

- que:
  - What? Johnny, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - It's Mom.

- que:
  - What? What is it?
  ans:
  - She's not here.

- que:
  - Whatta you mean she's not here?
  ans:
  - She...she died. It's like it just happened.

- que:
  - She just died, your mother just died?
  ans:
  - No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - October 22, 1969.

- que:
  - Murdered? Why?
  ans:
  - What kinda twisted animal.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I gotta take her away, John. I'm gonna take your mother away. He can't hurt her if I take her away.

- que:
  - I don't know... What about the other women?
  ans:
  - I'll warn them.

- que:
  - So what should I do? Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
  ans:
  - They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad. You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.

- que:
  - What do I tell them?
  ans:
  - Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.

- que:
  - Did you see him? Do you know who he is?
  ans:
  - No. I just kept talking to her. There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.

- que:
  - Whatta we do now?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - All right, I'm with you. I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.

- que:
  - What else, John. It must be different, huh? Are people living on the moon?
  ans:
  - Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.

- que:
  - What are we like in...1998?
  ans:
  - We're okay...we're good, Dad.

- que:
  - You really wanna know?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you betcha.

- que:
  - You there?
  ans:
  - John, say hello to my wife...Julia.

- que:
  - John, you still there?
  ans:
  - I'm right here, Dad.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think so...

- que:
  - But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
  ans:
  - Johnny, I know, but...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.

- que:
  - He took your wallet?
  ans:
  - No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.

- que:
  - He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet?
  ans:
  - His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet.

- que:
  - How the hell am I gonna do that?
  ans:
  - Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him.

- que:
  - Dad, what the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - Just a minute, John...okay? Don't go away.

- que:
  - Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John...

- que:
  - Sully! Is that you?
  ans:
  - Hey, Sull. My cable's out again.

- que:
  - Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
  ans:
  - I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.

- que:
  - Go in where?
  ans:
  - The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.

- que:
  - How you feeling?
  ans:
  - Better.

- que:
  - My father didn't die in a fire?
  ans:
  - Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.

- que:
  - Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
  ans:
  - Yeah, lung cancer. Ten years ago.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - The Ham radio. That's how come he didn't die in the fire.

- que:
  - How'd you know my name, mister?
  ans:
  - I better give you my address then.

- que:
  - Another rough night, huh? That it?
  ans:
  - Yeah. That's it.

- que:
  - So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
  ans:
  - Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm just trying to figure what interests me more, the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.

- que:
  - Got a minute?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sure.

- que:
  - Close.
  ans:
  - So how are things at the hospital?

- que:
  - So how'd you like LION KING?
  ans:
  - Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.

- que:
  - Hey, future boy. Frank tells me you're a cop?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's right.

- que:
  - Are you a good cop, John?
  ans:
  - I try to be.

- que:
  - Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
  ans:
  - No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.

- que:
  - No. What house you work?
  ans:
  - The 2-3. Homicide.

- que:
  - A hot shot, huh?
  ans:
  - Nah, just working the job.

- que:
  - No kiddin'?
  ans:
  - Huh.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet.

- que:
  - Who the fuck is this?
  ans:
  - Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

- que:
  - My name is Abel. And I am my brother's keeper.
  ans:
  - Sullivan?

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - I found this today. There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe \"he\" wanted me to have this...

- que:
  - ... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
  ans:
  - According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.

- que:
  - What're you gonna do?
  ans:
  - Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

- que:
  - So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
  ans:
  - Cool it, Andy.

- que:
  - Why don't we go take a swim?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look.

- que:
  - How about a roll in the hay?
  ans:
  - You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.

- que:
  - How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
  ans:
  - If you insist.

- que:
  - How do we do it?
  ans:
  - First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...

- que:
  - Think you can figure it out?
  ans:
  - I'll think of something.

- que:
  - That was the best yet. Was it you... me... or the hammock?
  ans:
  - I vote for me.

- que:
  - What're you doin'?
  ans:
  - I think it's called \"a shower\". You might try it sometime.

- que:
  - Hey Deb... can you hear me?
  ans:
  - Barely.

- que:
  - Do you want a beer or not?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
  ans:
  - I can't even remember what day it is, man.

- que:
  - Will you come with me?
  ans:
  - Be a man, man.

- que:
  - Which one is it?
  ans:
  - It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.

- que:
  - What are they saying?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I flunked Spanish.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Your bed.

- que:
  - Have you ever made love in a hammock?
  ans:
  - Derek... stop.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
  ans:
  - You can say... \"Hello, how are you?\"... for starters.

- que:
  - Hello. How are you?
  ans:
  - You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.

- que:
  - Is that so bad?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Did you stay here last night?
  ans:
  - No. I got here just before you did.

- que:
  - Are you all right, Shelly?
  ans:
  - Let's spread out and check all the rooms. Outside, too. You stay with me.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can never be sure of what's out there.

- que:
  - Why did you come back here?
  ans:
  - ... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.

- que:
  - I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through?
  ans:
  - I'm trying. I'm really trying.

- que:
  - What happened that night?
  ans:
  - You promised you'd never ask me.

- que:
  - Could we move a little faster?
  ans:
  - Sure, just watch where you're going.

- que:
  - You know him?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - You're Shelly?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - What d'ya got in there?
  ans:
  - My whole world.

- que:
  - In that little thing?
  ans:
  - Stick around and you'll see.

- que:
  - Why don't you help us?
  ans:
  - Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.

- que:
  - Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift?
  ans:
  - Not us! He's really creepy.

- que:
  - Is... is everything all right?
  ans:
  - Everything's gonna be fine.

- que:
  - Are they following us?
  ans:
  - Just a dirty window. Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that. Let's just hope that \"next time\" isn't too soon.

- que:
  - Got any good ideas?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell \"stop,\" you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay?
  ans:
  - You're the boss.

- que:
  - Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
  ans:
  - We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang... ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.

- que:
  - Who's Horace?
  ans:
  - My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go out and plug the cord back in.

- que:
  - Well, who told me to take this cow path?
  ans:
  - You admit the sign did say \"Camp Forest Green,\" with an arrow pointing this way.

- que:
  - He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
  ans:
  - But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.

- que:
  - Is that all you found?
  ans:
  - I wish it was.

- que:
  - Whaddya mean?
  ans:
  - Happy Friday the 13th.

- que:
  - Jason who?
  ans:
  - Megan, get away from him. He's dangerous.

- que:
  - How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
  ans:
  - You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.

- que:
  - What it is?
  ans:
  - Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.

- que:
  - I thought Jason was only a legend?
  ans:
  - He is. Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true... ...You stay put. And I'm not kidding.

- que:
  - Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
  ans:
  - We have! Trying to track you down. The phone there is disconnected.

- que:
  - Daddy, what is going on?
  ans:
  - And make sure my daughter stays put... ...She's grounded.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.

- que:
  - Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
  ans:
  - Uh...yes. But...

- que:
  - There...Ya happy?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause it stinks.

- que:
  - Lake Forest Green?
  ans:
  - Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.

- que:
  - They did show up. Isn't that great?
  ans:
  - I hope so.

- que:
  - So what happened?
  ans:
  - There was this monster. He was after me. He wanted to kill me.

- que:
  - Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
  ans:
  - Nancy.

- que:
  - ...Good. So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
  ans:
  - No more.

- que:
  - Where'd you get this?
  ans:
  - I found it outside.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.

- que:
  - Are they grown-ups?
  ans:
  - That's debatable.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I can't believe no one called back. I better...

- que:
  - But what if they try and scare us?
  ans:
  - We'll scare 'em right back.

- que:
  - Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
  ans:
  - It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.

- que:
  - So where's Cort gone off to?
  ans:
  - Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.

- que:
  - Which is?
  ans:
  - Boy scouting.

- que:
  - No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
  ans:
  - Hi. Everything's all right now. We're here.

- que:
  - What's goin' on?
  ans:
  - I think somebody's messin' around out there.

- que:
  - Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son?
  ans:
  - Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He's even more powerful now that...

- que:
  - And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, but they released me because...

- que:
  - -- yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have your hundred grand ready. For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
  ans:
  - Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?

- que:
  - Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - Save your...

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - You know what I want. You know why I need you.

- que:
  - Everything going okay?
  ans:
  - It's going.

- que:
  - Legs giving you trouble?
  ans:
  - Not so bad, today.

- que:
  - Do you have to ask?
  ans:
  - Ed...

- que:
  - Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.

- que:
  - What's the problem here?
  ans:
  - N...nothing.

- que:
  - Why did you want her body?
  ans:
  - For a good reason.

- que:
  - Does he know about what happened?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sit down a second. There's something I need to tell you about Steven...

- que:
  - I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
  ans:
  - Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...

- que:
  - Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
  ans:
  - Oh my God, Steven.

- que:
  - Wanna know how I did that?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - How many times do you want to hear this?
  ans:
  - Until I hear the truth.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About Jessica.

- que:
  - What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
  ans:
  - I mean really never.

- que:
  - Have you seen Tamara?
  ans:
  - No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.

- que:
  - He bought you that?
  ans:
  - More or less. It's part of my college fund.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Improvise, of course.

- que:
  - You're joking, right?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
  ans:
  - I guess not.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - That was truly excellent.

- que:
  - Well...how do you feel?
  ans:
  - Ask me in about five minutes.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What murders?
  ans:
  - Never mind, you don't want to know about it.

- que:
  - I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Hear what?
  ans:
  - All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.

- que:
  - And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
  ans:
  - Rennie's not coming.

- que:
  - Where's the radio?
  ans:
  - It's...dead.

- que:
  - Christ...where's Rennie?
  ans:
  - She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Perfectly.

- que:
  - What are you doing in here?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Where did you get that alcohol?
  ans:
  - I packed it. Just for us.

- que:
  - DEUSEN Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
  ans:
  - Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.

- que:
  - DEUSEN Where is she?
  ans:
  - I demand to know what is going on...

- que:
  - DEUSEN What are you doing?
  ans:
  - DEUSEN He's doing the best he can, Charles.

- que:
  - What did you do with Rennie?
  ans:
  - DEUSEN Nothing! I went to her cabin and...

- que:
  - Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
  ans:
  - You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this to yourself?
  ans:
  - Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.

- que:
  - Can't we at least talk about it?
  ans:
  - I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.

- que:
  - But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
  ans:
  - Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.

- que:
  - DEUSEN Everything okay?
  ans:
  - Just felt a little chill.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - DEUSEN Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.

- que:
  - That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
  ans:
  - Yeah...a lot.

- que:
  - DEUSEN Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
  ans:
  - Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.

- que:
  - DEUSEN When did this start?
  ans:
  - About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.

- que:
  - DEUSEN Did you have an accident in the lake?
  ans:
  - No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.

- que:
  - What is your location?
  ans:
  - I...I don't know...

- que:
  - Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Can he really take us home?
  ans:
  - Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - I don't know...we've gone off course or something...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...

- que:
  - Rennie...?
  ans:
  - The window...

- que:
  - Is the ship going to sink?
  ans:
  - Drugs... Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

- que:
  - Where you're going, mister?
  ans:
  - I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.

- que:
  - What did you find?
  ans:
  - Big mess every time.

- que:
  - You are going where?
  ans:
  - Crosstown.

- que:
  - What do you mean, we must abandon?
  ans:
  - Ruptured steam pipe.

- que:
  - Guys ready to order?
  ans:
  - Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.

- que:
  - Elliot?
  ans:
  - This is a great young out-of-work actress.

- que:
  - That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
  ans:
  - I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.

- que:
  - But didn't we know it would happen?
  ans:
  - Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.

- que:
  - Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
  ans:
  - Very dangerous.

- que:
  - What do I exude?
  ans:
  - Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.

- que:
  - Tonight. What's tonight?
  ans:
  - Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.

- que:
  - And he was there?
  ans:
  - Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.

- que:
  - What was it like?
  ans:
  - I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.

- que:
  - Do we care?
  ans:
  - I think we Nought to wait.

- que:
  - You say we go?
  ans:
  - Do not inhale.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Don't wait Efor me.

- que:
  - What about the haircut?
  ans:
  - He carries a gun.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.

- que:
  - We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
  ans:
  - In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There are things that speak to us from the past.

- que:
  - Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
  ans:
  - Keep going west. Last building before the river.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.

- que:
  - Yes. What are you implying?
  ans:
  - Of course I saw it.

- que:
  - Did you see the winning run score?
  ans:
  - You're not making sense. Make sense.

- que:
  - Does what feel comfortable?
  ans:
  - This could be it.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - She's dying.

- que:
  - Can he get through it?
  ans:
  - They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.

- que:
  - Because we're completely mismatched.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
  ans:
  - It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.

- que:
  - I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
  ans:
  - I go to college. I thought you knew.

- que:
  - Do you want to get some coffee?
  ans:
  - I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.

- que:
  - So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
  ans:
  - That's completely crazy.

- que:
  - If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
  ans:
  - Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.

- que:
  - Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
  ans:
  - I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.

- que:
  - I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
  ans:
  - Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.

- que:
  - Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - What will we talk about?
  ans:
  - Everything.

- que:
  - Will I believe you when you tell me something?
  ans:
  - There's nothing left for me to lie about.

- que:
  - Why won't you tell me your name?
  ans:
  - It's only our first date.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - Packs an emotional wallop.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - A flat-out hit.

- que:
  - What do we want?
  ans:
  - Mystery. Deception.

- que:
  - What's sexy?
  ans:
  - Knowing who a person is. Down deep.

- que:
  - Am I really so deeply repugnant?
  ans:
  - Yes. And no more evasive tactics.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.

- que:
  - All right. What's been going on?
  ans:
  - I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.

- que:
  - How prominent?
  ans:
  - He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.

- que:
  - Who the hell cares?
  ans:
  - The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.

- que:
  - I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
  ans:
  - Joanne Bourne.

- que:
  - Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
  ans:
  - I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.

- que:
  - What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
  ans:
  - This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.

- que:
  - What's it like to shoot somebody?
  ans:
  - I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.

- que:
  - What did it say?
  ans:
  - A thousand things.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - I'm at the door.

- que:
  - Where the hell are you?
  ans:
  - Right here. At the door.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - It's me. Nicky.

- que:
  - If it's you, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm on my way to get a haircut.

- que:
  - Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
  ans:
  - It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.

- que:
  - Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
  ans:
  - The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.

- que:
  - Since when did that matter?
  ans:
  - Let's not start that again.

- que:
  - Where's your elastic brace?
  ans:
  - I can't find it.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Show him who we are.

- que:
  - Everybody else does. Why not you?
  ans:
  - You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Some little kid stole the hubcaps.

- que:
  - The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
  ans:
  - Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.

- que:
  - How come you got the kid with you?
  ans:
  - Matthew's my grandson.

- que:
  - What am I doing?
  ans:
  - You're charming the boy.

- que:
  - I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
  ans:
  - If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.

- que:
  - Why do you care?
  ans:
  - The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.

- que:
  - And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
  ans:
  - You're out of bullets.

- que:
  - So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
  ans:
  - m not worried about this kid.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Have to hurry back.

- que:
  - Eleventh inning. What else?
  ans:
  - Game six is history,pal.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.

- que:
  - What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
  ans:
  - Burnt sienna.

- que:
  - And the Father replies?
  ans:
  - That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.

- que:
  - What's good?
  ans:
  - We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.

- que:
  - I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
  ans:
  - There was a review.

- que:
  - A little drastic maybe?
  ans:
  - Say it again.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know what.

- que:
  - You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
  ans:
  - I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.

- que:
  - Would you like to meet him?
  ans:
  - He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.

- que:
  - Is what true?
  ans:
  - He wears a disguise.

- que:
  - Do you think he can do it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where are you going now?
  ans:
  - Home.

- que:
  - Someone waiting for you?
  ans:
  - No one's waiting.

- que:
  - If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
  ans:
  - So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.

- que:
  - Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
  ans:
  - No. That is what you get for distracting me.

- que:
  - What do you expect when you talk like that?
  ans:
  - I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.

- que:
  - Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
  ans:
  - That was lucky.

- que:
  - Not quite. They're only \"holding me\" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
  ans:
  - What are you doing?

- que:
  - Did they take your clothes?
  ans:
  - If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.

- que:
  - How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
  ans:
  - Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.

- que:
  - You mean Gandhi?
  ans:
  - Back in South Africa... long time ago.

- que:
  - What was he like?
  ans:
  - Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - He said he's in charge...

- que:
  - Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
  ans:
  - A -- a week.

- que:
  - What can we do?
  ans:
  - We must end the campaign.

- que:
  - And Jinnah?
  ans:
  - He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.

- que:
  - There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
  ans:
  - Hm. And what should an \"important professional\" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?

- que:
  - Well, it's quite a place, your \"ashram\" -- is that right?
  ans:
  - That's right. The word only means \"community.\" But it could stand for \"village\"... or the world.

- que:
  - Hm. Is it?
  ans:
  - Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.

- que:
  - Do you remember much of South Africa?
  ans:
  - A great deal.

- que:
  - Is it over if they arrest you now?
  ans:
  - Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand. It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.

- que:
  - Are you going to walk all the way?
  ans:
  - My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.

- que:
  - Do you find me stubborn?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.

- que:
  - You mean a general strike?
  ans:
  - After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.

- que:
  - Who is that young man?
  ans:
  - I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.

- que:
  - You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
  ans:
  - I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less \"holy\" than Mr. Baker.

- que:
  - Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
  ans:
  - I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England. And I will use the courts.

- que:
  - I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
  ans:
  - Thank you. No.

- que:
  - Perhaps some tea?
  ans:
  - I dined at the prison.

- que:
  - Assuming we are in agreement?
  ans:
  - Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.

- que:
  - And that's the basis of this \"Declaration of Independence\"?
  ans:
  - OFFICER ...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest. And it still goes on.

- que:
  - He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
  ans:
  - Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.

- que:
  - Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
  ans:
  - He's \"discovering\" India.

- que:
  - Have you read his magazine?
  ans:
  - No -- but I think I'm going to.

- que:
  - Have you found him?
  ans:
  - ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.

- que:
  - Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
  ans:
  - It's for the best.

- que:
  - Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
  ans:
  - You didn't beat me that day. I beat myself.

- que:
  - Who are you trying to convince?
  ans:
  - I will prove it to you. Come swim with me now, Vincent. Now--tonight.

- que:
  - How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done any of this?
  ans:
  - Now is your chance to find out.

- que:
  - Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
  ans:
  - Er, no...

- que:
  - How much extra?
  ans:
  - It would be five thousand more.

- que:
  - No? What's keeping you?
  ans:
  - I guess I'm a slow learner.

- que:
  - Grudges?
  ans:
  - So there's a 20 percent chance he's not dead.

- que:
  - Even if this Vincent Luca is alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
  ans:
  - Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.

- que:
  - Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do you need any more than that?
  ans:
  - With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky.

- que:
  - A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
  ans:
  - No. But one or two \"borrowed ladders\" have shown up there in the past.

- que:
  - Where do we start?
  ans:
  - We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.

- que:
  - How often do you test, Director?
  ans:
  - Often.

- que:
  - Would you care to look--in the telescope?
  ans:
  - Thank you, no.

- que:
  - Jerome--?
  ans:
  - Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.

- que:
  - Now you're here. Who are your \"friends\"?
  ans:
  - It's about the Director.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.

- que:
  - I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
  ans:
  - He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.

- que:
  - What's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - You have more in common than you know.

- que:
  - Okay, how tall did you used to be?
  ans:
  - Six one.

- que:
  - What's wrong with it?
  ans:
  - I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be you.

- que:
  - Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
  ans:
  - German.

- que:
  - What about this?
  ans:
  - Wrong color. It's silver. It's not easy living up to this.

- que:
  - You really need that much?
  ans:
  - More than that. You'll get used to it.

- que:
  - God, you're serious, aren't you?
  ans:
  - It's not too late to back out.

- que:
  - What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
  ans:
  - Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent.

- que:
  - Who died?
  ans:
  - The Mission Director.

- que:
  - This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
  ans:
  - The place is crawling with Hoovers.

- que:
  - So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
  ans:
  - And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.

- que:
  - What is that one?
  ans:
  - 11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.

- que:
  - How long do you stay up there before you go?
  ans:
  - A day or so.

- que:
  - Any particular reason?
  ans:
  - We can't stay here.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - They think I offed the Director.

- que:
  - What makes them think that?
  ans:
  - They found my eyelash.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In a corridor.

- que:
  - And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I think I was crying.

- que:
  - You really had other offers?
  ans:
  - I'm sure I could have.

- que:
  - Is that all?
  ans:
  - I've got enough on my mind without that.

- que:
  - How was your evening?
  ans:
  - Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.

- que:
  - You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
  ans:
  - Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I've got plans.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.

- que:
  - Where are you taking her?
  ans:
  - Michael's.

- que:
  - Will you be okay?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.

- que:
  - I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
  ans:
  - How long?

- que:
  - How are you, Jerome?
  ans:
  - Not bad, Jerome.

- que:
  - Why have you done this?
  ans:
  - In case you get back before I do.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm travelling too.

- que:
  - First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
  ans:
  - We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.

- que:
  - Anything I've forgotten?
  ans:
  - We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children. We'd like grandchildren.

- que:
  - What will happen to the others?
  ans:
  - They are not babies, Maria, merely \"human possibilities\".

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think I could do something provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.

- que:
  - German, is that you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How tall are you?
  ans:
  - You can wear lifts.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - These new personality corrections I've been reading about.

- que:
  - You worried about the cost?
  ans:
  - Not that.

- que:
  - A fingerprint. There's something to be said for nostalgia. What did you find?
  ans:
  - No bother.

- que:
  - Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
  ans:
  - No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.

- que:
  - Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about you? Where were you last night?
  ans:
  - I was at home.

- que:
  - Were you alone?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.

- que:
  - Friend?
  ans:
  - It was a mercy-killing after all.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In the South Wing.

- que:
  - Does it have a name?
  ans:
  - Just some In-Valid. Vincent-- --somebody.

- que:
  - You didn't know?
  ans:
  - Yes...yes...

- que:
  - What exactly is wrong?
  ans:
  - Of course I think about it every day.

- que:
  - What is this place?
  ans:
  - You've never been here? Let me order for you.

- que:
  - Why are we leaving?
  ans:
  - Those checks take forever.

- que:
  - What about the car?
  ans:
  - Let's walk.

- que:
  - Who are they?
  ans:
  - It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.

- que:
  - But \"if it came to it\" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be?
  ans:
  - That's precisely what scares--worth a Goddamn.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.

- que:
  - Jerome...never shy. Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock. I ever told you that, Jerome?
  ans:
  - Only every time I'm in here.

- que:
  - What's this, Lamar?
  ans:
  - New policy.

- que:
  - Flight got you nervous?
  ans:
  - There's a problem, Lamar.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I can't do this.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.

- que:
  - Sure, You're working on the passports... ... and visas?
  ans:
  - They will be ready. You guys do your job.

- que:
  - What about your wife?
  ans:
  - What about her? Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.

- que:
  - What do you add up to here?
  ans:
  - One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.

- que:
  - You want to drive?
  ans:
  - My license expired, let's get out of here.

- que:
  - Feel good?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - Where do you want to go?
  ans:
  - I want to take a walk.

  - What's Beynon got set up?
  ans:
  - Small town, small bank, big money.

- que:
  - Where did you get those?
  ans:
  - I've been doing my homework.

- que:
  - Just like old times?
  ans:
  - Better than old times.

- que:
  - Where did you get them developed?
  ans:
  - Assumed name... Houston.

- que:
  - What do you want for dinner?
  ans:
  - Whisky and a peach.

- que:
  - How does it taste?
  ans:
  - Just the way I remembered.

- que:
  - You been okay?
  ans:
  - Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.

- que:
  - How's Estelle?
  ans:
  - Fatter... some things never change.

- que:

  ans:
  - Yes, I am.

  - That was easy, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - It was his idea.

  - Was it?
  ans:
  - I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.

- que:
  - Uh-huh?
  ans:
  - He told me my share was twenty-five.

  - Did I...?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do I...?
  ans:
  - Yes.

  ans:
  - I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...

- que:
  - Why did she do that, Jim?
  ans:
  - I don't know. They said we have three days. They said we have three days.

  ans:
  - If we wait till Mon...

  - When did you write the check?
  ans:
  - Yest...

- que:
  - What was yesterday?
  ans:
  - Tuesday.

  - And when was that check cashed?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
  ans:
  - Today. Today. Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.

- que:
  - The check wasn't cashed?
  ans:
  - I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - I told you.

- que:
  - What's going on here?
  ans:
  - Tell me again. Your wife.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - That...

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - I...

- que:
  - What power?
  ans:
  - The power to negotiate.

- que:
  - To negotiate what? To negotiate what?
  ans:
  - This.

- que:
  - What, \"this\"?
  ans:
  - The deal.

- que:
  - The \"deal,\" forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
  ans:
  - I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - And the check is...

- que:
  - What are the police doing?
  ans:
  - It's nothing.

- que:
  - You cashed the check?
  ans:
  - Not to my knowledge, no...

- que:
  - What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
  ans:
  - Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map. Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...

- que:
  - Guess what the Machine did?
  ans:
  - Fuck the Machine.

- que:
  - You hear what I said?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He closed a deal.

- que:
  - You did that?
  ans:
  - Fuck you.

- que:
  - Guess who?
  ans:
  - When...

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - They took 'em...

  ans:
  - I'm going home.

- que:
  - Your farewell to the troops?
  ans:
  - I'm not going home. I'm going to Wisconsin.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Aren't you going out today?
  ans:
  - With what? With what, John, they took the leads...

- que:
  - Patel? Ravidam Patel? How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs? Where did you get this, from the morgue?
  ans:
  - If you don't want it, give it back.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you like your party?
  ans:
  - I got lots of presents.

- que:
  - Do you like them?
  ans:
  - I didn't know the people who gave them to me.

- que:
  - No, where is it?
  ans:
  - On your pillow.

- que:
  - I know. How long will you be gone?
  ans:
  - Just a few days.

- que:
  - Will you take me?
  ans:
  - I can't.

- que:
  - Why do you have to go?
  ans:
  - At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.

- que:
  - What? You read it in the papers?
  ans:
  - This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.

- que:
  - Who is the greatest man you can think of?
  ans:
  - Go on, answer him when he talks to you. Tell him, Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.

- que:
  - What took so long?
  ans:
  - She couldn't decide.

- que:
  - What can we do?
  ans:
  - Vitone! Our driver has drunk too much wine.

- que:
  - I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late. This is for my Mama. You remember Merle?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you.

- que:
  - How are the kids?
  ans:
  - Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.

- que:
  - Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
  ans:
  - How are you, honey? You've met Merle, haven't you. He was with me in Vegas.

- que:
  - Why do you come to me? Why don't you go to a travel agent?
  ans:
  - Michael...

- que:
  - Is Kay coming?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
  ans:
  - I want to talk to you, Michael.

- que:
  - I hate to see you cringe in front of him. How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
  ans:
  - He's the head of the family.

- que:
  - I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
  ans:
  - Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.

- que:
  - Would you like some?
  ans:
  - No, Dad.

- que:
  - Now what is this talk about joining the army? Eh?
  ans:
  - It's not talk; I'm doing it.

- que:
  - You would risk your life for strangers?
  ans:
  - Not for strangers; for my country.

- que:
  - 1 Why'd you do it, Frankie? After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
  ans:
  - I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.

- que:
  - That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about. What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
  ans:
  - C'mon, I see what I can do.

- que:
  - Hey Mike, what can I say?
  ans:
  - Forget it, just go take care of her.

- que:
  - Great, Havana's great. Lots of activity in Havana! Anybody I know here. Five-Angels? Anybody?
  ans:
  - Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

- que:
  - Pentangeli's dead. He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers. Didn't you know that?
  ans:
  - It was hard to have him killed.

- que:
  - You know otherwise, Freddie?
  ans:
  - Me? NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas! You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.

- que:
  - How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
  ans:
  - Yo soy un hombre sincero... I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...

- que:
  - The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
  ans:
  - Sincere. What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.

- que:
  - ...Who?
  ans:
  - The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing. I've already made my move.

- que:
  - What is it? Can I help?
  ans:
  - The old man will never bring in the New Year.

- que:
  - Nowhere, Mike. I wanted to get a refill. How about you?
  ans:
  - I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

- que:
  - What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
  ans:
  - I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.

- que:
  - There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
  ans:
  - The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.

- que:
  - He's an Italian?
  ans:
  - A pig of a Neaponitan.

- que:
  - Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone? What do you think of my angel?
  ans:
  - Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.

- que:
  - No, I didn't know. Is he dead?
  ans:
  - Nah. Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all. Make him look bad.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because he's what we say... connected... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.

- que:
  - And he agreed?
  ans:
  - He took the money. Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.

- que:
  - I'm going to see my parents.
  ans:
  - Chi?

- que:
  - How long does this go on?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...

- que:
  - Am I a prisoner?
  ans:
  - That's not the way we look at it.

- que:
  - Where's my wife?
  ans:
  - He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - She's gone, Tom.

- que:
  - What do you mean gone?
  ans:
  - Why didn't someone tell me!

- que:
  - Will you tell him?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Goddamn it, where were you?
  ans:
  - I was in my house. Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.

- que:
  - Me too, Tom?
  ans:
  - Yeah, give me a minute.

- que:
  - Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles specific areas of the family business. Tom?
  ans:
  - Sure, Mikey.

- que:
  - Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
  ans:
  - But if you're wrong...

- que:
  - Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
  ans:
  - No. But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.

- que:
  - Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
  ans:
  - I took care of it.

- que:
  - Where's my brother?
  ans:
  - Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami. Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.

- que:
  - I asked about Fredo?
  ans:
  - My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping. Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.

- que:
  - Was it a boy or a girl?
  ans:
  - Mike, at three and a half...

- que:
  - And Kay...she's all right?
  ans:
  - She took the Senate Investigation worse.

- que:
  - Does she blame it on me? The baby?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
  ans:
  - He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him. Roth played this one beautifully.

- que:
  - Sit down, Tom. Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
  ans:
  - I know he's in Israel.

- que:
  - I'm staying. Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that. Now, explain everything to me.
  ans:
  - Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?

- que:
  - Fifteen percent skim?
  ans:
  - Twenty-five this time.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - No questions.

- que:
  - How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
  ans:
  - He's going to try Panama...

- que:
  - Did my brother go back?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but don't worry.

- que:
  - Tom, what do I do now?
  ans:
  - Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history. I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43. We were young then.

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did. No strings.

- que:
  - Do you owe markers?
  ans:
  - Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

- que:
  - Is he related to the witness?
  ans:
  - He is, I believe, a brother.

- que:
  - Whose orders are these?
  ans:
  - Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, Michael. Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left. Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
  ans:
  - Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.

- que:
  - How's the baby?
  ans:
  - Sleeping inside me.

- que:
  - Does it feel like a boy?
  ans:
  - Yes, Michael, it does.

- que:
  - Why don't you sit down?
  ans:
  - I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

- que:
  - Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
  ans:
  - His brother came to help him.

- que:
  - I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
  ans:
  - On a plane back to Sicily.

- que:
  - You would have killed his brother?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - Who do you think you're talking to?
  ans:
  - You said you were Klingman.

- que:
  - I'm alright. Will you stay home for awhile?
  ans:
  - There are still things I have to do.

- que:
  - Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight. How are your eyes?
  ans:
  - You talk about the baby. She can have another baby.

- que:
  - Your family? How can you ever lose your family?
  ans:
  - But times are different...

- que:
  - Sit down, this is almost over. You follow the baseball games?
  ans:
  - Not for a few years.

- que:
  - Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
  ans:
  - It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.

- que:
  - I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well. As a heavy investor, I'm pleased. How did the doctor find you?
  ans:
  - Terrible. I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.

- que:
  - Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
  ans:
  - Why...the Rosato Brothers.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, that occurred to me.

- que:
  - How is his health?
  ans:
  - Not good.

- que:
  - Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
  ans:
  - He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.

- que:
  - Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
  ans:
  - That is not true. I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts. I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.

- que:
  - Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
  ans:
  - I do not.

- que:
  - When do we talk?
  ans:
  - After dinner.

- que:
  - Says who?
  ans:
  - Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.

- que:
  - I didn't want you to know I was coming. You heard what happened in my home?
  ans:
  - Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

- que:
  - Michael, anything. What is it I can do for you?
  ans:
  - I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.

- que:
  - Frankie...do you respect me? Do I have your loyalty?
  ans:
  - I know.

- que:
  - Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
  ans:
  - Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed. I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.

- que:
  - On the phone?
  ans:
  - No, she's here.

- que:
  - Rosato, where's your brother?
  ans:
  - Sitting right behind you.

- que:
  - He don't want to talk?
  ans:
  - We worked it all out beforehand.

- que:
  - Are we going to eat or what?
  ans:
  - Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club.

- que:
  - You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
  ans:
  - We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.

- que:
  - Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
  ans:
  - My lawyer went over this beforehand.

- que:
  - What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
  ans:
  - The same assurance we got from you.

- que:
  - What if I say shove it?
  ans:
  - Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.

- que:
  - You want a war?
  ans:
  - He supports me.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - That's a lucky C note for our new deal.

- que:
  - How much more a month?
  ans:
  - Eh... Five dollars more.

- que:
  - I say let loverboy watch his movie. And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
  ans:
  - What was that?

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - Just thinking out loud.

- que:
  - So what did you think?
  ans:
  - Weird.

- que:
  - What's to be jealous of?
  ans:
  - I've gotten to know someone who's famous.

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water.

- que:
  - Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
  ans:
  - It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.

- que:
  - It never crossed your mind?
  ans:
  - I'm not a kid.

- que:
  - What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
  ans:
  - I like my life. I'm a free man.

- que:
  - Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
  ans:
  - Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games.

- que:
  - Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him?
  ans:
  - No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say. Here. I will take the tray.

- que:
  - Something I can do for you?
  ans:
  - The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.

- que:
  - How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
  ans:
  - Long enough. Fifteen years.

- que:
  - No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have people, Boone?
  ans:
  - You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri.

- que:
  - Your wife?
  ans:
  - I'm not married.

- que:
  - Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
  ans:
  - A man who is not married has nothing. He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.

- que:
  - You ever been married, Hanna?
  ans:
  - Of course. I am married still.

- que:
  - Yeah? What's your husband do?
  ans:
  - He is dead now, twenty years.

- que:
  - You're sure of that?
  ans:
  - This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.

- que:
  - No. His is the worse. The unspeakable. The deed no man can name without shame?
  ans:
  - What is the good English? All I know is bugger. He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.

- que:
  - Yes! You know?
  ans:
  - That is why he must go to hell. I do not think it fair. But God's law is not for us to judge.

- que:
  - There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
  ans:
  - You did not know?

- que:
  - Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
  ans:
  - I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late. I only hope you did not get him excited. It could give him a new stroke.

- que:
  - What do I do?
  ans:
  - Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.

- que:
  - I put him to bed. He's not there?
  ans:
  - I didn't do it. This wasn't me.

- que:
  - But how're you going to explain this? How did you get him out of the pool?
  ans:
  - You are right. Yes. We must put him back.

- que:
  - And your name is --?
  ans:
  - Boone. Clayton Boone.

- que:
  - I couldn't help but notice your tattoo. That phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean?
  ans:
  - Just that I was in the Marines.

- que:
  - Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
  ans:
  - Just got away from me. Sorry to disturb you.

- que:
  - Or would you prefer a beer?
  ans:
  - No. Iced tea's fine.

- que:
  - These are your paintings?
  ans:
  - What? Oh yes.

- que:
  - They're just copies then. Gotcha.
  ans:
  - Excuse me, but -- are you famous?

- que:
  - Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something?
  ans:
  - In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here.

- que:
  - Yeah? What were some of your movies?
  ans:
  - This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the \"Frankenstein\" pictures.

- que:
  - \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of\" and \"Son of\" and all the rest?
  ans:
  - I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.

- que:
  - Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna with our refreshments. Can you get the door?
  ans:
  - When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you. Please, Mr. Boone. Help yourself.

- que:
  - What did she mean by going flooey?
  ans:
  - I returned recently from a stay in hospital.

- que:
  - What was wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing serious. A touch of stroke.

- que:
  - You mean, like posed for pictures?
  ans:
  - Sat for an artist. Been sketched.

- que:
  - What's to sketch?
  ans:
  - You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive.

- que:
  - But expressively broken. How did it happen?
  ans:
  - Football in college.

- que:
  - You went to university?
  ans:
  - Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines.

- que:
  - You mean -- you really want to draw me?
  ans:
  - Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.

- que:
  - But why?
  ans:
  - Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.

- que:
  - And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
  ans:
  - What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.

- que:
  - You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
  ans:
  - I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that.

- que:
  - Hmmm. I much prefer \"Show Boat\" or \"The Invisible Man.\" Shall we begin?
  ans:
  - That shirt, Mr. Boone.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
  ans:
  - I'm not wearing an undershirt.

- que:
  - We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
  ans:
  - All right already. I'll take it off. Kind of warm in here anyway.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
  ans:
  - Your family ate dripping?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me.

- que:
  - Do you mind?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - This David's a friend?
  ans:
  - Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.

- que:
  - Did you now?
  ans:
  - I liked it. We all did.

- que:
  - Did anyone laugh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you kill anyone?
  ans:
  - I don't like to talk about that.

- que:
  - Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
  ans:
  - No. I could have, though.

- que:
  - Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon?
  ans:
  - Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.

- que:
  - What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?
  ans:
  - Can't today.

- que:
  - You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
  ans:
  - No. At least not in the legal sense.

- que:
  - So you had a wife?
  ans:
  - Or a husband. Depending on which of us you asked. My friend David. He lived here for many years.

- que:
  - Does that surprise you?
  ans:
  - No, I -- you're a homosexual.

- que:
  - What way might that be?
  ans:
  - You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women.

- que:
  - So we understand each other?
  ans:
  - What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.

- que:
  - Can I see what you did so far?
  ans:
  - It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.

- que:
  - Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion?
  ans:
  - Not at the moment.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.

- que:
  - Is that why you and your friend split up? Because you wanted to be free?
  ans:
  - In a way, yes. I suppose so. I know it's why I stopped making pictures.

- que:
  - Better work.
  ans:
  - Do you miss it?

- que:
  - How long were you...?
  ans:
  - You first.

- que:
  - I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to come back?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I guess I like your stories.

- que:
  - And the fear you showed at our last session? How did you overcome that?
  ans:
  - Not fear. More like disgust.

- que:
  - No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea?
  ans:
  - You must think the whole world is queer. Well it's not. War sure isn't.

- que:
  - You were a soldier?
  ans:
  - I was an officer.

- que:
  - No, my dear. The Crimean War. What do you think? The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
  ans:
  - This was World War I?

- que:
  - Something happened to him?
  ans:
  - You will not set me on another walk down memory lane. Not this lane. Not today.

- que:
  - Just go. Please. Why don't you go?
  ans:
  - I want -- I want...

- que:
  - You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
  ans:
  - If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest. There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.

- que:
  - Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
  ans:
  - Clayton is fine.

- que:
  - Do I look okay?
  ans:
  - I suppose you'd like the top down.

- que:
  - If that's okay?
  ans:
  - Nothing would please me more.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - David. The friend I thought was in New York.

- que:
  - Is that really her?
  ans:
  - David produced her last picture.

- que:
  - Are you enjoying yourself?
  ans:
  - Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.

- que:
  - Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
  ans:
  - Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it?

- que:
  - Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
  ans:
  - Good. Let's get dry.

- que:
  - Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes.

- que:
  - You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
  ans:
  - Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know.

- que:
  - Do I have any other choice?
  ans:
  - Very sporting of you, Clayton.

- que:
  - Is that --?
  ans:
  - The only memento I ever kept. My original sketch for the Monster.

- que:
  - After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd given up on my picture.

- que:
  - Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing?
  ans:
  - Never gave it much thought.

- que:
  - The Great War?
  ans:
  - By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I didn't have the guts for it.

- que:
  - Do you mind?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - You're planning a trip?
  ans:
  - Barnett. Barnett on the wire.

- que:
  - Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
  ans:
  - You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - No. It won't do.

- que:
  - What won't do?
  ans:
  - You are much too human.

- que:
  - What did you expect? Bronze?
  ans:
  - Don't move.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking.

- que:
  - It's from the first World War, isn't it?
  ans:
  - There are straps in back.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - It's too tight.

- que:
  - Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with yourself?
  ans:
  - You're crazy.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Oh Clayton.

- que:
  - Did I hurt you?
  ans:
  - Nothing I didn't deserve.

- que:
  - Need some help?
  ans:
  - Pray you, undo this button.

- que:
  - You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
  ans:
  - This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.

- que:
  - You coming, Boone?
  ans:
  - I think I'll hang around.

- que:
  - Have a drink?
  ans:
  - Can't say that I have. Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.

- que:
  - If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
  ans:
  - I told you. I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.

- que:
  - I just want to watch it, okay?
  ans:
  - Sick stuff. Necrophilia. I wonder if they knew how sick they were.

- que:
  - The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
  ans:
  - Go home, Clay. We're closing up.

- que:
  - Where's Betty?
  ans:
  - She took the night off. Heavy date. Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.

- que:
  - Should you be drinking in your condition?
  ans:
  - Oh, David, stop being a nanny.

- que:
  - Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean. Your reputation.

- que:
  - Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?
  ans:
  - No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent.

- que:
  - Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
  ans:
  - Yes. Perfectly.

- que:
  - Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm trying to explain.

- que:
  - You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
  ans:
  - That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.

- que:
  - So what do I do?
  ans:
  - Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.

- que:
  - Uh-oh. The way you look at me, James. What have you done this time?
  ans:
  - Bring a mirror. Let the Bride feast upon her visage.

- que:
  - Boris? Do I look a fright?
  ans:
  - And you said there'd be some of me left. Nobody's going to know me in this getup.

- que:
  - Elsa?
  ans:
  - I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.

- que:
  - What's our pesky friend up to now?
  ans:
  - Is that Boris? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.

- que:
  - Hanna? Who's the new yardman?
  ans:
  - Bone? Boom? Something Bee. I hire him while you were in the hospital. He came cheap.

- que:
  - There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber sandwiches?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Which ones? I bring them all.

- que:
  - My mind's lovely. And yours?
  ans:
  - You remember what the doctor tells us.

- que:
  - Oh, that monster. How could you be working with him?
  ans:
  - Don't be silly, Hanna. He's a very proper actor. And the dullest fellow imaginable.

- que:
  - He is not going to kill the old man?
  ans:
  - No, Hanna. My heart isn't that black.

- que:
  - You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
  ans:
  - I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.

- que:
  - Does the yardman come today?
  ans:
  - Of course. This afternoon.

- que:
  - Who was that at the door?
  ans:
  - A visitor.

- que:
  - Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
  ans:
  - I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.

- que:
  - Of course. How is the old boy these days?
  ans:
  - It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...

- que:
  - Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - Everything. Start at the beginning.

- que:
  - No. I never said you were. Or will be soon.
  ans:
  - How much longer before we get to \"Frankenstein\"?

- que:
  - I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I don't mind.

- que:
  - It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
  ans:
  - You're serious.

- que:
  - What rumors might those be?
  ans:
  - That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.

- que:
  - Can that count as one question?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Just like going swimming, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.

- que:
  - Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
  ans:
  - I just need to -- lie down. Studio. Daybed in studio.

- que:
  - Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your heart?
  ans:
  - Head. Not heart.

- que:
  - Mr....Kay?
  ans:
  - Bet you thought you'd never see me again. I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.

- que:
  - You didn't?
  ans:
  - I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.

- que:
  - You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor?
  ans:
  - I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.

- que:
  - My monsters?
  ans:
  - Don't go away.

- que:
  - Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
  ans:
  - Splendid. Now that I know you're around.

- que:
  - Sit?
  ans:
  - I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session. Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.

- que:
  - Oh dear. Have I made a blunder?
  ans:
  - Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale.

- que:
  - He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
  ans:
  - How's the leg?

- que:
  - What kind of job... ?
  ans:
  - A boost. A big boost ...

- que:
  - Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
  ans:
  - A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

- que:
  - Who do you think?
  ans:
  - Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...

- que:
  - What's with the fish thing -- ?
  ans:
  - Fish.

- que:
  - How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
  ans:
  - You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

- que:
  - Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
  ans:
  - Point-five ...

- que:
  - How ya doing?
  ans:
  - It's about my brother ... Kip...

- que:
  - They gave you only four days?
  ans:
  - I'm not interested --

- que:
  - And if he doesn't make it -- ?
  ans:
  - I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

- que:
  - This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
  ans:
  - Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...

- que:
  - Well, that certainly won't do.
  ans:
  - This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?

- que:
  - What do you mean -- ?
  ans:
  - Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Let them go. And I'll leave ...

- que:
  - You'll leave -- ?
  ans:
  - I don't golf...

- que:
  - Or your baby brother. What was his name?
  ans:
  - Kip.

- que:
  - And this has what to do with me?
  ans:
  - I know you.

- que:
  - What are you still doing here, Randall?
  ans:

- que:
  - How about one now?
  ans:
  - Sounds good.

- que:
  - Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
  ans:
  - I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.

- que:
  - You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
  ans:
  - About thirty million to one.

- que:
  - What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - There is somebody...

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - He was my roommate in college.

- que:
  - What should I do?
  ans:
  - The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.

- que:
  - What happened? You got fired, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

- que:
  - How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
  ans:
  - There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' \"skiin' trip.\" We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

- que:
  - Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.

- que:
  - So, you finally got a job Morgan?
  ans:
  - Had one, now I'm fucked again.

- que:
  - So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
  ans:
  - That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.

- que:
  - Like what, Will?
  ans:
  - I go places, I interact.

- que:
  - What places?
  ans:
  - Certain, clubs. Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.

- que:
  - Have you read all these books, Will?
  ans:
  - Probably not.

- que:
  - How about the ones on that shelf?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I read those.

- que:
  - I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Whatever blows your hair back.

- que:
  - Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
  ans:
  - 285.

- que:
  - Yeah. Do you paint?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Crayons?
  ans:
  - This is a real piece of shit.

- que:
  - What does?
  ans:
  - The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.

- que:
  - Watch your mouth.
  ans:
  - Oh, \"Starry Night\" time, huh?

- que:
  - That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
  ans:
  - If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.

- que:
  - So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
  ans:
  - You've never been on a plane.

- que:
  - Yeah? You got a lady now?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I went on a date last week.

- que:
  - How'd it go?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Well, are you going out again?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Haven't called her.

- que:
  - You ever think about gettin' remarried?
  ans:
  - My wife's dead.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I gave that up when my wife got sick.

- que:
  - Is that why you didn't write anything else?
  ans:
  - I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.

- que:
  - Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean. All those guys were in your platoon?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
  ans:
  - Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.

- que:
  - You don't regret meetin' your wife?
  ans:
  - Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - I was havin' a drink with my future wife.

- que:
  - You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Do you have a soul-mate?
  ans:
  - Define that.

- que:
  - Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
  ans:
  - Don't give me you line of shit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm here. So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.

- que:
  - Do you want to talk about it?
  ans:
  - Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.

- que:
  - --No, have you had any experience with that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The wrench, why?
  ans:
  - Cause fuck him, that's why.

- que:
  - That's what you want?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think so.

- que:
  - Thanks you. So, that's it? We're done?
  ans:
  - We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.

- que:
  - Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
  ans:
  - Only if you grab my ass.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm Will.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I was trying to be smooth. But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.

- que:
  - It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.

- que:
  - You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
  ans:
  - I bet your parents were happy to pay.

- que:
  - Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
  ans:
  - Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.

- que:
  - So you just want to use me and go?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.

- que:
  - In that case, fine. Want to see my magic trick?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Oh, you will?
  ans:

  - Free?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I'm supposed to understand this.

- que:
  - You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why do we always stay here?
  ans:
  - Cause it's nicer than my place.

- que:
  - What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
  ans:
  - They don't come over here that much.

- que:
  - Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
  ans:
  - All right, all right. We'll go.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Sometime. I don't know. Next week.

  ans:
  - Fine.

  - Want me to take a look?
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.

  ans:
  - We can pick anything.

  - You sure you got ever'thing ready?
  ans:
  - Ain't gonna be no trouble.

- que:
  - Oh... really?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I sell biscuits to the Southland.

- que:
  - So, what are you doing now?
  ans:
  - Whatever I can get away with.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

- que:
  - I sell BMW's. What do you do?
  ans:
  - Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.

- que:
  - Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
  ans:
  - Bob...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's me. Martin Blank.

- que:
  - Really...? So what?
  ans:
  - Okay. See you later.

- que:
  - Fine, Bob. How are you?
  ans:
  - Never better.

- que:
  - What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I want to be an actor.

- que:
  - So you eat-- read it everyday?
  ans:
  - 1 Yes.

- que:
  - And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
  ans:
  - 1 Correct. That's for you. Keep it.

- que:
  - Ten years, I think. What I miss?
  ans:
  - Here is now there. There is here.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - Not much else.

- que:
  - What's your business?
  ans:
  - I'm a professional killer.

- que:
  - Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
  ans:
  - Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

- que:
  - --Torn down in the name of convenience--
  ans:
  - Where have I been?

- que:
  - No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
  ans:
  - That's part of it.

- que:
  - Watched television?
  ans:
  - Bad television.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.

- que:
  - Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you there?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hello...?
  ans:
  - This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.

- que:
  - Do you want to get a drink first?
  ans:
  - I think they'll probably have booze there.

- que:
  - We haven't seen each other since high school.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
  ans:
  - Wow. I have to give this some thought.

- que:
  - Like heroin?
  ans:
  - Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

- que:
  - Like love?
  ans:
  - Could be. The physical substance of love.

- que:
  - Not the other way around...?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is it something you've done?
  ans:
  - It's something I do...

- que:
  - You're a government spook?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ!

- que:
  - Will you come with me?
  ans:
  - I'm staying here.

- que:
  - What if I come back?
  ans:
  - I'll hide.

- que:
  - It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
  ans:
  - You went to school with these people.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you be taking notes?
  ans:
  - Tell me about your vision of the reunion.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I just know.

- que:
  - You know where I live?
  ans:
  - We're both professionals, Oatman.

- que:
  - So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
  ans:
  - Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.

- que:
  - What stuff?
  ans:
  - Morality.

- que:
  - Out Loud?
  ans:
  - ...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.

- que:
  - How was your day, today, sir?
  ans:
  - Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.

- que:
  - Do you like the people you work with?
  ans:
  - I work alone.

- que:
  - You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.

- que:
  - Like a union?
  ans:
  - Like a club. Work less, make more.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.

- que:
  - ...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Not bad. You?
  ans:
  - Hello, Bob.

- que:
  - Have you seen Debi Newberry?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Lisbon?
  ans:
  - In Portugal, yes.

- que:
  - Here's the news, He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
  ans:
  - In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Did you see Blank in there?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - This?
  ans:
  - Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.

- que:
  - It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
  ans:
  - Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.

- que:
  - All of it?
  ans:
  - And not show it to me. Ever again.

- que:
  - Would you describe their position as inflexible?
  ans:
  - Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

- que:
  - Good. What else? Anything interesting?
  ans:
  - Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.

- que:
  - Enough?
  ans:
  - Never enough.

- que:
  - What's it look like?
  ans:
  - It's fine.

- que:
  - Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
  ans:
  - What's a revival tent?

- que:
  - I have a headache. You have a headache?
  ans:
  - No, I don't have one.

- que:
  - We had a good laugh, didn't we?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I guess we did.

- que:
  - And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
  ans:
  - I have always thought about her and missed her.

- que:
  - Paul?
  ans:
  - You're leaving me hanging here...

- que:
  - So what happened to you?
  ans:
  - Fair enough.

- que:
  - Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
  ans:
  - No. You drove us here.

- que:
  - Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Ten years. What happened!?
  ans:
  - I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.

- que:
  - He sells BMW's?
  ans:
  - He sold me this bad boy.

- que:
  - How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
  ans:
  - He gave me a great deal.

- que:
  - What the hell happened to you?
  ans:
  - I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

- que:
  - So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
  ans:
  - To shoot you. Correct.

- que:
  - How did you get this job?
  ans:
  - Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.

- que:
  - So what are you doing with your life now, son?
  ans:
  - I'm a professional killer.

- que:
  - Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
  ans:
  - Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...

- que:
  - You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
  ans:
  - Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.

- que:
  - I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
  ans:
  - Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.

- que:
  - Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
  ans:
  - When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.

- que:
  - Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
  ans:
  - That's up to Pilgrim.

- que:
  - So how was your first and last day of branding?
  ans:
  - Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.

- que:
  - You ever just stand still for a minute?
  ans:
  - That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.

- que:
  - Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
  ans:
  - It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.

- que:
  - You lived in Chicago?
  ans:
  - When I was first married.

- que:
  - You were married to a woman in Chicago?
  ans:
  - Well, I, uh... you didn't...

- que:
  - Just who's been laughing at who here?
  ans:
  - I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.

- que:
  - A jogger, huh?
  ans:
  - I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.

- que:
  - You sleeping all right in that house?
  ans:
  - I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.

- que:
  - I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
  ans:
  - I have a way with animals.

- que:
  - Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
  ans:
  - Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.

- que:
  - He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
  ans:
  - Need a lift?

- que:
  - Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
  ans:
  - No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.

- que:
  - Feel good?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - How long did you live here with your wife?
  ans:
  - Five years. My son was born here.

- que:
  - Why didn't it work out?
  ans:
  - She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.

- que:
  - Ever think of moving there full time?
  ans:
  - We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.

- que:
  - Everything under control?
  ans:
  - Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Show me again.

- que:
  - How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
  ans:
  - I don't know any other way, Annie.

- que:
  - Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
  ans:
  - The point was to love each other.

- que:
  - Why don't you go lie down?
  ans:
  - I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.

- que:
  - Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Oh, honey... What happened?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.

- que:
  - Is that your version of a pep talk?
  ans:
  - I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Maybe they should put me down too.

- que:
  - I don't care.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
  ans:
  - Whatever you want.

- que:
  - Would you like to see that?
  ans:
  - I don't care.

- que:
  - That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
  ans:
  - How long is this going to go on?

- que:
  - Did he tell you that?
  ans:
  - No, you just act like you do.

- que:
  - You buckled up? You cold?
  ans:
  - Little.

- que:
  - There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
  ans:
  - I didn't see it.

- que:
  - Did you ask him to come visit?
  ans:
  - You already did.

- que:
  - You got everything you need?
  ans:
  - If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.

- que:
  - Why? There's no food in the house?
  ans:
  - No. I just thought... forget it.

- que:
  - Does anybody out there want something to drink?
  ans:
  - I'll take care of it.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I said... I started.

- que:
  - Started what?
  ans:
  - My period.

- que:
  - When? Tonight?
  ans:
  - I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.

- que:
  - Who's going to want me now?
  ans:
  - What?... Oh baby...

- que:
  - Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
  ans:
  - Tom's gone.

- que:
  - How's everything?
  ans:
  - Good.

- que:
  - Who's there?
  ans:
  - Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.

- que:
  - Did you speak to Farlow?
  ans:
  - Yes. We're suing.

- que:
  - If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
  ans:
  - Uh, yes... Sure, David.

- que:
  - So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
  ans:
  - I should be in by two.

- que:
  - Sure... What's Grace up to?
  ans:
  - Riding with Judith.

- que:
  - What about Grace?
  ans:
  - Nothing new. He's just going off duty.

- que:
  - ... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
  ans:
  - Oh. Right. I'll call him.

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.

- que:
  - Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What was I saying?
  ans:
  - About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...

- que:
  - NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
  ans:
  - I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...

- que:
  - You've already made arrangements!?
  ans:
  - No. I was just researching. Calm down.

- que:
  - What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
  ans:
  - She will if you think she should.

- que:
  - So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.

- que:
  - When are you coming home?
  ans:
  - You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.

- que:
  - Huh-huh. You?
  ans:
  - Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.

- que:
  - How are you feeling about work?
  ans:
  - Let's not talk about that now.

- que:
  - Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
  ans:
  - Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.

- que:
  - Yeah, what?
  ans:
  - Take your time.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I don't understa-

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Tubab means white man.

- que:
  - Was the trip okay?
  ans:
  - Mmm. I made good time. Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...

- que:
  - Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
  ans:
  - We have a business manager. The best around.

- que:
  - I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. I made enough for an army.

- que:
  - What choice!!?
  ans:
  - Either fight the way things are or accept it.

- que:
  - Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
  ans:
  - Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.

- que:
  - Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
  ans:
  - Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.

- que:
  - Where does this go, Diane?
  ans:
  - Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.

- que:
  - I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
  ans:
  - Thank you. You're all doing too much.

- que:
  - I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
  ans:
  - I was there for that shot, actually.

- que:
  - What was it like?
  ans:
  - I'd love to go there one time...

- que:
  - You and Frank ever take a vacation?
  ans:
  - Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.

- que:
  - Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
  ans:
  - Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.

- que:
  - They fired you?
  ans:
  - No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.

- que:
  - You don't seem to upset?
  ans:
  - Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.

- que:
  - Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
  ans:
  - Frank's a good man.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - Promise.

- que:
  - Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
  ans:
  - Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.

- que:
  - Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
  ans:
  - They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.

- que:
  - It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
  ans:
  - Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.

- que:
  - I have some brownies left over. Want one?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
  ans:
  - Sure. As long as she don't mind.

- que:
  - When you figure on branding?
  ans:
  - Weekend after next...

- que:
  - Tom?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Don't you go to school?
  ans:
  - Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.

- que:
  - Have you talked to Tom about it?
  ans:
  - Of course I have.

- que:
  - You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
  ans:
  - I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.

- que:
  - She gonna be long?
  ans:
  - Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.

- que:
  - What does she do?
  ans:
  - She's an editor.

- que:
  - Isn't it like, obvious?
  ans:
  - Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.

- que:
  - That's not a question, is it?
  ans:
  - You're catching on.

- que:
  - Can you drive?
  ans:
  - Drive? I'm not old enough yet.

- que:
  - Where did you get Pilgrim from?
  ans:
  - We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.

- que:
  - Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess. What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
  ans:
  - I know where he goes.

- que:
  - Sure?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - I want to watch.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.

- que:
  - Jude, you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm okay... I'm okay.

- que:
  - Have you heard from Judith's parents?
  ans:
  - No, not yet.

- que:
  - OK, OK.
  ans:
  - How's Pilgrim doing?

- que:
  - Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just not that hungry.

- que:
  - You want to watch some television?
  ans:
  - Maybe... look -- just...

- que:
  - What, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - I want to see Pilgrim.

- que:
  - Did you notice -- no cane?
  ans:
  - I know. Amazing.

- que:
  - Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
  ans:
  - I did. He said he had work to do until late.

- que:
  - How much longer do you think?
  ans:
  - Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.

- que:
  - Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I didn't know what was on it.

- que:
  - Why did he come to you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - Are you crazy? What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to help you.

  - What?
  ans:
  - Thanks for your help.

- que:
  - Wanna go for a swim?
  ans:
  - I can't believe they decided you won.

- que:
  - Dreams?
  ans:
  - Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques. Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
  ans:
  - Uhhhmm...

- que:
  - Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
  ans:
  - No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - We caught 'em.

- que:
  - It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
  ans:
  - A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.

- que:
  - Colonel who?
  ans:
  - The System Command Processor, it's the brain.

- que:
  - Mr. Belford?
  ans:
  - My name is the Plague.

- que:
  - As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
  ans:
  - Never fear. I is here.

- que:
  - What? whatwhatwhat?
  ans:
  - I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.

- que:
  - Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
  ans:
  - You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

- que:
  - Yo, what's up?
  ans:
  - Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...

- que:
  - What is he doing in here?
  ans:
  - Relax, Burn, he's my guest.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hey, it's me.

- que:
  - Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
  ans:
  - Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.

- que:
  - Virus?
  ans:
  - Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.

- que:
  - What the hell was that all about?
  ans:
  - I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't want to go to jail for this.

- que:
  - But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
  ans:
  - Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.

- que:
  - Murphy kid turn you down?
  ans:
  - I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

- que:
  - Pervert! What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans. I just hacked into it.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

- que:
  - They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
  ans:
  - Not everything. But enough to implicate us.

- que:
  - What is it? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.

- que:
  - What number please?
  ans:
  - 555-4202.

- que:
  - Purpose of visit?
  ans:
  - A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.

- que:
  - Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
  ans:
  - Real charmer.

- que:
  - Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
  ans:
  - Jamie needs a Halloween costume.

- que:
  - Okay sure. What about?
  ans:
  - Its about tonight.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My parents baby-sitter canceled.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So I have to watch Jamie tonight.

- que:
  - When did you find this out?
  ans:
  - My parents are going to come home early tonight.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I don't know Brady.

- que:
  - Are you two okay?
  ans:
  - We've been better.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Michael Myers.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - 10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.

- que:
  - Its metal, god dammit its metal.
  ans:
  - You think she stands a chance?

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.

- que:
  - An accident?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
  ans:
  - Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?

- que:
  - Can't you find somebody else?
  ans:
  - You guys always look great.

- que:
  - Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks. Hello?
  ans:
  - Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10,30 with Chuck.

  ans:

- que:
  - How do you know their not?
  ans:

- que:
  - How many people in the bus?
  ans:
  - Four plus Myers.

- que:
  - Now where are you going?
  ans:
  - Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.

- que:
  - Ready to go. Who signs for him?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - Who you calling?
  ans:
  - Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.

- que:
  - What the hell did this?
  ans:
  - Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.

- que:
  - Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
  ans:
  - Al here lost his boy 10 years back.

- que:
  - Do you love me Rachel?
  ans:
  - Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.

- que:
  - Like a sister?
  ans:
  - Jamie, sometimes it's...

- que:
  - Like a real sister?
  ans:
  - We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.

- que:
  - Double scoops?
  ans:
  - Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.

- que:
  - You ready for some Ice Cream?
  ans:
  - I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.

  - The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
  ans:
  - You bet.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's coming to get me Rachel.

- que:
  - Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
  ans:
  - Yeah, hurry up.

- que:
  - No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
  ans:
  - Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.

- que:
  - Can we go home soon Rachel?
  ans:
  - Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.

- que:
  - I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
  ans:
  - Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.

- que:
  - Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
  ans:
  - We'll hear sirens soon.

- que:
  - Then we'll be safe?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You don't believe that do you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Dad, what's going on?
  ans:
  - Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just do it.

- que:
  - I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
  ans:
  - You knew. You just didn't care.

- que:
  - Don't you mean what you do best?
  ans:
  - Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.

- que:
  - You remember Lindsay don't you?
  ans:
  - Hi Jamie.

- que:
  - I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
  ans:
  - I don't want to look pushy.

- que:
  - Jamie?
  ans:
  - Call me.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.

- que:
  - You look sharp. You understand?
  ans:
  - No problem, Sheriff.

- que:
  - You got your riot gun?
  ans:
  - Yeah in the trunk of my squad.

- que:
  - What are we doing?
  ans:
  - Making sure that no one can get in here.

- que:
  - Isn't this all a little paranoid?
  ans:
  - If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.

- que:
  - Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
  ans:
  - Got it Ben.

- que:
  - Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
  ans:
  - I am. Ben Meeker.

- que:
  - Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
  ans:
  - Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - 10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.

- que:
  - Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
  ans:
  - Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.

- que:
  - All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
  ans:
  - When he makes that call.

- que:
  - Something?
  ans:
  - He's been here.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - This is starting to spook me.

- que:
  - Is that him? Is that him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
  ans:
  - Evil.

- que:
  - Where's that Deputy?
  ans:
  - Be here in a minute.

- que:
  - How's it powered?
  ans:
  - It's over.

- que:
  - Loomis. Haddonfield.
  ans:
  - How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?

- que:
  - Car trouble?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
  ans:
  - Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.

- que:
  - Sheriff, what is going on out there?
  ans:
  - All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.

- que:
  - Now you understand?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Hi, Annie, Laurie...
  ans:
  - Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

- que:
  - The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
  ans:
  - You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.

- que:
  - He shouts, too.
  ans:
  - Huh?

- que:
  - Why didn't you wait for me?
  ans:
  - We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.

- que:
  - Well, are we still on for tonight?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.

- que:
  - Saving the treats for Bob?
  ans:
  - Fun-ny. See you.

- que:
  - Look.
  ans:
  - Exploring uncharted territory?

- que:
  - Look where?
  ans:
  - Behind that bush there.

- que:
  - Annie, was that you?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
  ans:
  - I thought it was an obscene phone call.

- que:
  - You still spooked?
  ans:
  - I wasn't spooked.

- que:
  - What's the pumpkin for?
  ans:
  - I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

- que:
  - What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - I'd say you must have the wrong number.

- que:
  - Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - And I can't keep you interested?
  ans:
  - That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...

- que:
  - Want a beer?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is that all you say?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - YEAH?
  ans:
  - My parents won't be back till ten.

- que:
  - We're all alone, aren't we?
  ans:
  - Michael's around someplace...

- que:
  - Will you call me tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Anybody live here?
  ans:
  - Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - Sure...

- que:
  - Exactly what do you need?
  ans:
  - Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.

- que:
  - Hi, Laurie, what's up?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.

- que:
  - Is Annie around?
  ans:
  - No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.

- que:
  - Are you coming over tonight?
  ans:
  - Same time, same place.

- que:
  - Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Can we watch the monster movies?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
  ans:
  - Sure. Sure.

- que:
  - Why are they under there?
  ans:
  - Mom doesn't like me to have them.

- que:
  - Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
  ans:
  - Laurie...

- que:
  - What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
  ans:
  - After the movie.

- que:
  - What about the rest of my comic books?
  ans:
  - After the Jack-O-Lantern.

- que:
  - What about the bogyman?
  ans:
  - There is no such thing.

- que:
  - Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - I promise.

- que:
  - Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
  ans:
  - Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.

- que:
  - Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
  ans:
  - Who is it?

- que:
  - Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
  ans:
  - What is it, Laurie?

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I killed him...

- que:
  - Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
  ans:
  - Let's make more popcorn.

- que:
  - Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
  ans:
  - Yes, she is.

- que:
  - Will you get her for me?
  ans:
  - She's washing her clothes.

- que:
  - Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What did you use before?
  ans:
  - Thorazin.

- que:
  - Are there any special instructions?
  ans:
  - Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.

- que:
  - Ever done anything like this before?
  ans:
  - Only minimum security.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.

- que:
  - He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
  ans:
  - I love that. That's my type.

- que:
  - Are you really interested?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - Uh, who gets dropped first?

- que:
  - And then, uh, April...huh?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Oh, is that what it is?
  ans:
  - It's really terrible.

- que:
  - If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
  ans:
  - Well, sometimes, some, uh...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say.

- que:
  - And you, you-you're going?
  ans:
  - But I'm seeing him.

- que:
  - Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
  ans:
  - Oh, that was a wonderful show. I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - Do you remember that summer in France? Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.

- que:
  - Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
  ans:
  - I can't resist.

- que:
  - Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
  ans:
  - Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.

- que:
  - Really? Is the food that bad?
  ans:
  - Oh no. Not at all.

- que:
  - What makes you think we're more interesting?
  ans:
  - We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...

- que:
  - Oh, what, what do you do?
  ans:
  - I'm an architect.

- que:
  - What time do you get off?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
  ans:
  - Fast.

- que:
  - Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - So what's the, uh, problem this time?
  ans:
  - No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.

- que:
  - Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
  ans:
  - What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.

- que:
  - The hospital? What kind of tests?
  ans:
  - Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing.

- que:
  - It's nothing. Will you trust me?
  ans:
  - Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.

- que:
  - How ya doin', man?
  ans:
  - I told him about your work, and he's very excited.

- que:
  - What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.

- que:
  - Well, are...are they big?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.

- que:
  - You-- Standards and Practices?
  ans:
  - Ed Smythe, yes.

- que:
  - Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
  ans:
  - Child molestation is a touchy subject...

- que:
  - Like, uh...?
  ans:
  - I don't know exactly.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.

- que:
  - You're out looking here?
  ans:
  - Yes, I do.

- que:
  - Where are you headed?
  ans:
  - Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never tough alcohol.

- que:
  - I think to myself what problems could she possibly have?
  ans:
  - Don't let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you would.

- que:
  - What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book?
  ans:
  - Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...

- que:
  - You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
  ans:
  - No! No...

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yeah. How are you?
  ans:
  - I'm...all right.

- que:
  - Bye.
  ans:
  - How-how's Frederick?

- que:
  - How's everything?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.

- que:
  - Oh, you-you have that one?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Isn't that beautiful?
  ans:
  - I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.

- que:
  - Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
  ans:
  - Yes, he's just adorable.

- que:
  - Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
  ans:
  - Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful...so romantic.

- que:
  - I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
  ans:
  - Did you ever read this one--?

- que:
  - Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
  ans:
  - Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.

- que:
  - What do you expect me to say?
  ans:
  - Hannah and I are in the last stages.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.

- que:
  - But not over me?
  ans:
  - Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.

- que:
  - W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
  ans:
  - But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?

- que:
  - Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
  ans:
  - O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out.

- que:
  - You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
  ans:
  - Oh, all the time.

- que:
  - Is something wrong?
  ans:
  - Oh, not here. There are too many people around.

- que:
  - And you're in love overnight?
  ans:
  - Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them.

- que:
  - Aren't they great?
  ans:
  - Your sister is an unbelievable cook.

- que:
  - Let's go have dinner, shall we?
  ans:
  - Mmm.

- que:
  - Where're you going?
  ans:
  - I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

- que:
  - Are you in a bad mood?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy.

- que:
  - Was I?
  ans:
  - Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.

- que:
  - Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
  ans:
  - Well, tell me. Should I be worried?

- que:
  - But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.

- que:
  - Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
  ans:
  - I didn't say that.

- que:
  - Are you in love with someone else?
  ans:
  - My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.

- que:
  - Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me?
  ans:
  - What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.

- que:
  - Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you?
  ans:
  - Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us.

- que:
  - ...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
  ans:
  - Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them?

- que:
  - Hi. How's she doing?
  ans:
  - I am glad to see you.

- que:
  - Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you some coffee. That's enough of that. What triggered it?
  ans:
  - We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...

- que:
  - How can we be happy?
  ans:
  - Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought.

- que:
  - But Catholicism? Why not your own people?
  ans:
  - I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.

- que:
  - That thought doesn't terrify you?
  ans:
  - Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll be dead.

- que:
  - I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - How about something to eat?
  ans:
  - No, nothing.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
  ans:
  - God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.

- que:
  - Isn't it enough that I can love you?
  ans:
  - Mmm...

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - ...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
  ans:
  - Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out.

- que:
  - I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Look at this guy.
  ans:
  - In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?

- que:
  - N-n-no, not that.
  ans:
  - Yeah?

- que:
  - But not you.
  ans:
  - Hello?

- que:
  - Well, he has to rule out certain things.
  ans:
  - Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?

- que:
  - No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
  ans:
  - Like what?! What?

- que:
  - Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
  ans:
  - Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.

- que:
  - You're just realizing this now?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...

- que:
  - Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
  ans:
  - Yes, please.

- que:
  - Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something. Or go to a whorehouse! No?
  ans:
  - I can't stay on this show. I gotta get some answers. Otherwise I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.

- que:
  - Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
  ans:
  - I think they're fantastic.

- que:
  - Doesn't she look pretty?
  ans:
  - I bumped into your...

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.

- que:
  - Hi. Where's Holly?
  ans:
  - Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? How's she doing?
  ans:
  - I hope you tell her it was your idea...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.

- que:
  - So how are you?
  ans:
  - Oh, me, I'm okay.

- que:
  - Do you miss Frederick?
  ans:
  - I'm okay.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...

- que:
  - What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay?
  ans:
  - I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have a headache.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I think we need to eat.

- que:
  - How is everything?
  ans:
  - Everything's good. Everything's fine.

- que:
  - Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot?
  ans:
  - He's fine.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.

- que:
  - Gee.
  ans:
  - The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt?

- que:
  - Is there no chance?
  ans:
  - You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.

- que:
  - What, by a st-stranger?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.

- que:
  - Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
  ans:
  - I want to experience childbirth.

- que:
  - Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure.

- que:
  - Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
  ans:
  - This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.

- que:
  - I know. H-how much do you need?
  ans:
  - Two thousand dollars.

- que:
  - You admit that we're great cooks, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Will you just tell me one thing?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Are we talking about cocaine again?
  ans:
  - I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.

- que:
  - Ohh?
  ans:
  - Uh-oh.

- que:
  - Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Don't you think she does?
  ans:
  - She really does, though.

- que:
  - Oh!
  ans:
  - When does Frederick ever come with her?

- que:
  - Well, how about this?
  ans:
  - Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - ...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...

- que:
  - Well, I think he was dying to open up. It's so sad. Now...what should I wear to my audition?
  ans:
  - I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical. Of course, I'll never get it.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-what have I got to lose? Uh...

- que:
  - Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
  ans:
  - No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.

- que:
  - W-why? You don't think it's realistic?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.

- que:
  - Awwww...
  ans:
  - What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?

- que:
  - They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
  ans:
  - So what's new?

- que:
  - Oh, what do they know?
  ans:
  - Oh, gosh.

- que:
  - Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's clerical.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
  ans:
  - Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.

- que:
  - Hey, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - I'm real upset about what you wrote.

- que:
  - My script?
  ans:
  - It's obviously based on Elliot and me.

- que:
  - Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off?
  ans:
  - Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.

- que:
  - Well, why don't you share them with us?
  ans:
  - I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.

- que:
  - Don't, no, please. Will you-- No, don't...
  ans:
  - Oh, why are you making those faces?

- que:
  - You want some?
  ans:
  - Come on, Mickey. Come on.

- que:
  - My--uh...
  ans:
  - Can we, can we go?

- que:
  - I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
  ans:
  - Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.

- que:
  - Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
  ans:
  - Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.

- que:
  - Yes, you do recall, right?
  ans:
  - I recall you.

- que:
  - Good. How are you?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - It was a terrible evening.

- que:
  - You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
  ans:
  - People change...you know.

- que:
  - So how are you?
  ans:
  - I'm okay.

- que:
  - You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Oh, nothing much. You know...

- que:
  - Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
  ans:
  - Probably not.

- que:
  - Are you, are you out of work or something?
  ans:
  - No, well...I've been trying to write.

- que:
  - Have you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff?
  ans:
  - Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.

- que:
  - Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, \"Hey, I have something I just wrote,\" right?
  ans:
  - Nobody ever said it.

- que:
  - This is it. Yeah. This is really-- HOLLY Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it? Something...that I wrote?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm fine.

- que:
  - What...what about your script? So what's it about?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.

- que:
  - Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
  ans:
  - You must be joking. I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.

- que:
  - Well, what about me?
  ans:
  - Oh, well.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Oh, it just came to me one day.

- que:
  - Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
  ans:
  - I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...

- que:
  - Well... I'll tell you. One day about a month ago...
  ans:
  - Oh, who cares?

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? What?
  ans:
  - Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be ridiculous.

- que:
  - Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Hi. How you doin'?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - When'd you get here?
  ans:
  - Just a few minutes ago.

- que:
  - Mmm, what?
  ans:
  - I'm pregnant.

- que:
  - At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice?
  ans:
  - Mm-hm.

- que:
  - Where are the antihistamines?
  ans:
  - Dad...

- que:
  - April?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.

- que:
  - Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat?
  ans:
  - Boy...Holly...Holly.

- que:
  - Why are you so upset?
  ans:
  - You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I'm just suffocating.

- que:
  - What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, what's your religion?
  ans:
  - Take our literature...

- que:
  - Tell me about your trip... what did you bring me...?
  ans:
  - I can't think.

- que:
  - A reward for what?
  ans:
  - Some museum director disappeared.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - They're offering...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You've gone off to America, on your Vacation...

- que:
  - Yes? My promotion...?
  ans:
  - I want to talk to you about your salary. Because I can't...

- que:
  - Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
  ans:
  - I hereby acknowledge that...

- que:
  - Then why did you chose to inform me of it...?
  ans:
  - To show...

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle...?
  ans:
  - If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.

- que:
  - ...what hindered you...?
  ans:
  - It wasn't my day.

- que:
  - ...how are things at the Hospital?
  ans:
  - It's a growth business.

- que:
  - What have they got you doing?
  ans:
  - Orderly.

- que:
  - He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or, \"natural composting.\" Do you think he'd come after you...?
  ans:
  - We got a bunch of materials.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - ...very good.

- que:
  - ...why?
  ans:
  - Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...

- que:
  - Now, whyn't you help us?
  ans:
  - That would adversely impact my income.

- que:
  - Then who's buying it?
  ans:
  - There's one or two freaks, and, for a \"Pass,\" I'll rat them out to you...

- que:
  - You want me to be?
  ans:
  - I'd prefer it... But it's just a vacant exercise.

- que:
  - ...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
  ans:
  - ...they did it for a lark.

- que:
  - Who are these guys...?
  ans:
  - Rich, comic book freaks.

- que:
  - And why is it a vacant exercise?
  ans:
  - Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.

- que:
  - And have you found Peace..?
  ans:
  - Bad beat today.

- que:
  - Hey, I'm fine. Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?

  ans:
  - Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.

- que:
  - What's up...?
  ans:
  - Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.

- que:
  - Yeah, so where is he?
  ans:
  - Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.

  ans:
  - Their family owns...

- que:
  - What else did I miss...?
  ans:
  - Atrocious Torture. Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.

- que:
  - ...are they hard to get?
  ans:
  - Impossible.

- que:
  - You spend the afternoon in Bed?
  ans:
  - First things first.

- que:
  - You take this much time over everything?
  ans:
  - That's why my wife adores me.

- que:
  - Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
  ans:
  - Not with any certainty we...

- que:
  - Why did he come back?
  ans:
  - Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....

- que:
  - ...are you alright, sir...?
  ans:
  - HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we Seen it Before.

- que:
  - Seen what, sir..?
  ans:
  - Do it...

- que:
  - Waal, Nobody's Perfect... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
  ans:
  - If you would see him monument, look around you.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling. He will come to her.

- que:
  - You give me whatever I want...?
  ans:
  - Yes. You know I will. That's right.

- que:
  - The children...?
  ans:
  - ...they're from Baltimore....

- que:
  - What would that be?
  ans:
  - He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation. To a charitable institution of your choice.

- que:
  - Now, why in the world would he do that?
  ans:
  - I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction. To his appearance.

- que:
  - What reaction?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - Do you know the seller?
  ans:
  - We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.

- que:
  - He is...?
  ans:
  - He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.

- que:
  - And how would you know that?
  ans:
  - Before \"The Change,\" Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.

- que:
  - I believe that your tone implied that there was some good...
  ans:
  - ...young boys, still...?

- que:
  - Oh, yes, what? You'd bribe me, to, to, to, \"release\" you...?
  ans:
  - ..suitcase...locker...

- que:
  - ....what...?
  ans:
  - ...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.

  ans:
  - For a consideration.

  - Starling...?
  ans:
  - One moment, and they're at the Seven-. They botched the fallback plan, they...

- que:
  - ...what's he got against you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I want the same... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.

- que:
  - What's that, Baby?
  ans:
  - Alcohol. Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities... ...not unlike some Hindu God...

  - That's what I should do. Tell me why?
  ans:
  - Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....

- que:
  - Yeah, but who would marry friendless me... Howabout you, Romeo...?
  ans:
  - ...not to turn around.

  - Give me your gun...

- que:

  ans:
  - ...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are expensive...

- que:
  - ...why are we here in the first place...?
  ans:
  - Because it is exclusive... because everyone will be here...

- que:
  - Because...?
  ans:
  - Because we cannot pay...

- que:
  - PHONE ...what did you want?
  ans:
  - I know where he is.

- que:
  - PHONE And why should we believe you?
  ans:

  ans:
  - ...I feel that...

- que:
  - Tell me why...?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.

- que:
  - ...and to have done...?
  ans:
  - ....that's right.

- que:
  - ..and humiliation? What is this new job they've...?
  ans:
  - No. That's right. That's all part of it.

- que:
  - Then, that being so, why is today special? Why have you come back to see me? Is it that new file they gave you?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - I don't know. Do you know...?
  ans:
  - Yes. I think I do, to your mind, your most private fears.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...

- que:
  - ...would you use a small word?
  ans:
  - Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions. that's all we have time for today...

- que:
  - That if decision here. Why are you here...?
  ans:
  - I..

- que:
  - ...yes...?
  ans:
  - I want to do something positive...

- que:
  - ...why?
  ans:
  - Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.

- que:
  - ...yes...?
  ans:
  - But. He was a night watchman? His hat an his badge. Clear as day, bulletholes and all.

- que:
  - But they were not there. Yesterday. Is that called a Delusion...?
  ans:
  - For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.

- que:
  - No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
  ans:
  - Because we must leave the past in the past. Ah. And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...

- que:
  - Because?
  ans:
  - Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.

- que:
  - And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
  ans:
  - Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. And because you have large resources.

- que:
  - ...sir...?
  ans:
  - Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings.

- que:
  - And this Peepers was your...dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
  ans:
  - Why are you...don't stop...why?

- que:
  - That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
  ans:
  - Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!

- que:
  - Did you wait until you were 18?
  ans:
  - I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.

- que:
  - Now what? What did I do this time?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to know if you've seen this.

- que:
  - Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah, that's...wow.

- que:
  - Eavesdropping, eh? Hear anything good?
  ans:
  - Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...

- que:
  - Wha-at? What is it?
  ans:
  - Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope? Where you going? I don't want to know.

- que:
  - No, they're not from Wendy.
  ans:
  - Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?

- que:
  - Your Secret admirer?
  ans:
  - Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.

- que:
  - Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
  ans:
  - Hello?! What's in it for me?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Why do you even like me?
  ans:
  - You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.

- que:
  - Yeah. And?
  ans:
  - It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.

- que:
  - \"...how important our friendship...\" Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
  ans:
  - I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.

- que:
  - Hey--that coffee? You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
  ans:
  - Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...

- que:
  - Do you really not believe in God?
  ans:
  - It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...

- que:
  - What else don't you believe in?
  ans:
  - Talking while kissing.

- que:
  - When were you in Niagara Falls?
  ans:
  - About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.

- que:
  - Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
  ans:
  - It's been known to happen.

- que:
  - Do you really think I care?
  ans:
  - She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.

- que:
  - Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
  ans:
  - What do you want me to say?

- que:
  - It's not my style, okay?
  ans:
  - Nice guys finish last. I should know.

- que:
  - So, are you a cheerleader?
  ans:
  - No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.

- que:
  - Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
  ans:
  - Hey, don't run away now.

- que:
  - What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! What are you smiling at?
  ans:
  - I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

- que:
  - Like last night, Veronica?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry? I don't get it.

- que:
  - So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
  ans:
  - I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

- que:
  - So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
  ans:
  - I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

- que:
  - Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
  ans:
  - Because you're an idiot.

- que:
  - Something like that. Will you do it?
  ans:
  - Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.

- que:
  - I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
  ans:
  - I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.

- que:
  - Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
  ans:
  - Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......

- que:
  - I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
  ans:
  - Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.

- que:
  - Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
  ans:
  - Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.

- que:
  - Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
  ans:
  - You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.

- que:
  - I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
  ans:
  - That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.

- que:
  - Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.

- que:
  - Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
  ans:
  - No. Hell no.

- que:
  - Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
  ans:
  - We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.

- que:
  - Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
  ans:
  - Is this turnout weak or what? I had at least seventy more people at my funeral.

- que:
  - So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
  ans:
  - I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...

- que:
  - Very very. The photographs?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.

- que:
  - Guess who?
  ans:
  - Heather.

- que:
  - Is she dead?
  ans:
  - I said I was sorry.

- que:
  - It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yeah, I just got back.
  ans:
  - Jealous much?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.

- que:
  - God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
  ans:
  - Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.

- que:
  - Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
  ans:
  - That was seriously warped, Veronica.

- que:
  - Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
  ans:
  - Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.

- que:
  - What were you trying to do? Sleep?
  ans:
  - Suicide is a private thing.

- que:
  - If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
  ans:
  - Probably....

- que:
  - If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
  ans:
  - That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.

- que:
  - You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
  ans:
  - No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.

- que:
  - The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
  ans:
  - I didn't. Cherry.

- que:
  - Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
  ans:
  - Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?

- que:
  - Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
  ans:
  - Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.

- que:
  - I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
  ans:
  - That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.

- que:
  - O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
  ans:
  - Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

- que:
  - Like a suicide thing?
  ans:
  - Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.

- que:
  - She missed \"myriad\" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
  ans:
  - That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.

- que:
  - What is this shit?
  ans:
  - I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.

- que:
  - Do you take German?
  ans:
  - French.

- que:
  - Did you miss him completely?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....

- que:
  - We killed them, didn't we?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
  ans:
  - Your son's dead and you love him.

- que:
  - Can't you see this is a special moment?
  ans:
  - I was just making it more special.

- que:
  - Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
  ans:
  - I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.

- que:
  - This knife is filthy.
  ans:
  - It's over, J.D. Over!

- que:
  - What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
  ans:
  - I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.

- que:
  - How do you turn the fucker off?
  ans:
  - You really fucked me up, Veronica.

- que:
  - Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
  ans:
  - Veronica is into his act. No doubt.

- que:
  - I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Any contestants worth mentioning?
  ans:
  - Maybe. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.

- que:
  - Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - How was the funeral?
  ans:
  - Superb.

- que:
  - I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
  ans:
  - All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.

- que:
  - Where is he? Where's J.D.?
  ans:
  - We have to talk. Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.

- que:
  - People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
  ans:
  - I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.

- que:
  - We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
  ans:
  - playfully shoves his hand away.

- que:
  - Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday ... anyone want to give me a hand?
  ans:
  - Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room ... endlessly writing.

- que:
  - Is it hurting, dear?
  ans:
  - is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - She says Juliet's in a terrible state ...

- que:
  - Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
  ans:
  - Juliet's infectious ... she'll be going to hospital.

- que:
  - Can I go now?
  ans:
  - grabs Pauline by the shoulders.

- que:
  - What does old Stew want?
  ans:
  - She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.

- que:
  - stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
  ans:
  - These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well ... no. But it's so obvious.

- que:
  - You mean travel by ourselves?
  ans:
  - Stay still or they'll be blurry ...

- que:
  - It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
  ans:
  - Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?

- que:
  - Your mother is a rather miserable woman ... isn't she?
  ans:
  - Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...

- que:
  - What's happening to me? What are you doing?
  ans:
  - You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

- que:
  - Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
  ans:
  - Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...

- que:
  - Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
  ans:
  - Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.

- que:
  - Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
  ans:
  - Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.

- que:
  - Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
  ans:
  - Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.

- que:
  - So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
  ans:
  - All finished.

- que:
  - Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
  ans:
  - Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.

- que:
  - Second most common?
  ans:
  - Skin cancer.

- que:
  - I understand, I think. Other women?
  ans:
  - You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.

- que:
  - No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
  ans:
  - Sure plenty of times.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.

- que:
  - Did I ever talk about the accident?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.

- que:
  - Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
  ans:
  - Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.

- que:
  - Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
  ans:
  - Must be nice.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Getting paid for doing shit.

- que:
  - Gwen.
  ans:
  - Yeah, how's that?

- que:
  - GWEN?
  ans:

- que:
  - And she thinks you're blackmailing me?

- que:
  - Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my life?
  ans:
  - Me? Listen, I don't give no interviews. That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.

- que:
  - Is she... serious? A half a million dollars? In my behalf?
  ans:
  - You're a celebrity, John. People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.

- que:
  - No, John, you're too hard on yourself. I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
  ans:
  - You do?

- que:
  - What're we talking about? Reach out for what?
  ans:
  - I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...

- que:
  - That too.
  ans:
  - He's gotta be a nut! He saves all those people and swipes a purse?

- que:
  - Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
  ans:
  - There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...

- que:
  - How'd it go?
  ans:
  - He'll do it. You really-should have talked to him first.

- que:
  - Ticket! What's going on?
  ans:
  - She's flying to New York. She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...

- que:

- que:
  - Upset! What's he upset about?
  ans:
  - Said he's not an actor.

- que:

  - What?
  ans:
  - The Presidency. The public loves him.

- que:
  - You were in bed. Weren't you?
  ans:
  - If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to. I... I hate the way he behaves... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...

- que:
  - What's \"cynical\"?
  ans:
  - Oh my God! Bernie!

- que:
  - You didn't?
  ans:
  - I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.

- que:
  - \"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!\" Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now? 'Cause he stole paint?
  ans:
  - We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...

- que:
  - Is he like that in real life? So gorgeous?
  ans:
  - He's pretty... remarkable.

- que:
  - You didn't... get it on with him?
  ans:
  - Don't be ridiculous. I'm a reporter.

- que:
  - Reporters don't have hormones?
  ans:
  - Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - I didn't ask him.

- que:
  - Safety?
  ans:
  - Look at that. You can't buy better protection than that. That there is your Man's Best Friend.

- que:

  - So, Neil. How's it goin'?
  ans:
  - Okay.

  ans:
  - Hey, c'mon.

- que:
  - Was that your dad?
  ans:
  - Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.

- que:
  - So where are all your toys?
  ans:
  - Let's watch some TV.

- que:
  - Where are these toys of yours?
  ans:
  - A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet. Here's the TV.

- que:
  - Are you being helped, sir?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for some perfume.

- que:
  - Any particular brand?
  ans:
  - Well, it's for a woman.

- que:
  - Wife, girlfriend or mother?
  ans:
  - Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.

- que:
  - How's the new place?
  ans:
  - It's great. It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers. There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.

- que:
  - And the rent is okay?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.

- que:
  - Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
  ans:
  - Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time. Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --

- que:
  - And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
  ans:
  - Oh, fine. She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.

- que:
  - Who doesn't?
  ans:
  - I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.

- que:
  - Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Well, can I make an appointment?
  ans:
  - Maybe I could take a look at it now.

- que:
  - Do you do washing machines, too?
  ans:
  - Just show me the way.

- que:
  - It's a living.
  ans:
  - Isn't that always the way?

- que:
  - Do you have a family?
  ans:
  - Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.

- que:
  - I was driving by -- I saw all the cars. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Can I tell you tomorrow? I think I...

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - I'm thirsty.

- que:
  - A man? Was it a dream?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Did Daddy tease you?
  ans:
  - Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.

- que:
  - So you don't have anything concrete?
  ans:
  - No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt.

- que:
  - Have you just plain asked him?
  ans:
  - I've asked him what's wrong.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I could take a cab on the way home.

- que:
  - Whew.
  ans:
  - No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?

- que:
  - The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
  ans:
  - No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.

- que:
  - Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
  ans:
  - That's okay, Mom.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.

- que:
  - You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
  ans:
  - They don't expect to get what they're asking. Let's make an offer.

- que:
  - It's a nice pool, isn't it?
  ans:
  - And it's a shorter commute.

- que:
  - What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
  ans:
  - We're going to think about it.

- que:
  - Damn.
  ans:
  - How were we -- were we cool?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He made, you know, a remark.

- que:
  - Honey, are you okay?
  ans:
  - -- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is? Some nice neighborhood.

- que:
  - How was your lunch with Charlie?
  ans:
  - Oh -- great.

- que:
  - Do you remember who gave us this?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How long does it have to be a new house?
  ans:
  - One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.

- que:
  - He's made some friends, hasn't he?
  ans:
  - There are to get caught.

- que:
  - Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.

- que:
  - Did the cleaning woman come?
  ans:
  - His secretary just confirmed.

- que:
  - What -- what are you doing?
  ans:
  - I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh, honey.

- que:
  - Someone blew the whistle. Someone hates me.
  ans:
  - Everything! It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some -- Do you smell smoke?

- que:
  - Philip, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I think it's time I came home now.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here. And if you want to talk to me -- call.

- que:
  - Should I come home when I'm finished there?
  ans:
  - We'll talk in the morning.

- que:
  - It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - Not very long. There have been a couple of bids already.

- que:
  - Isn't it?
  ans:
  - You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.

- que:
  - How large is your brood?
  ans:
  - Two -- three if you count the husband.

- que:
  - 1 What for, dickweed?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
  ans:
  - I didn't.

- que:
  - Oh really? You've been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
  ans:
  - If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.

- que:
  - What did the thermometer say?
  ans:
  - -- A man.

- que:
  - Do you see a man?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Where's the bed?
  ans:
  - Right over here.

- que:
  - Is it a king or a queen?
  ans:
  - It's a double.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - Promise.

- que:
  - Would you?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - What the hell. What is this? A joke?
  ans:
  - No joke, Lieutenant.

- que:
  - Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
  ans:
  - Parker. We found him knocked out in the can.

- que:
  - If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
  ans:
  - Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.

- que:
  - Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
  ans:
  - You can believe what you want. You saw the tape.

- que:
  - Lieutenant Bedsoe?
  ans:
  - Not now. I'm busy.

- que:
  - What? Who are you? What do you want?
  ans:
  - My name is Jennifer Hillman. I'm an archaeologist. I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - They appear to be authentic.

- que:
  - Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
  ans:
  - Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.

- que:
  - You didn't see this. Understand?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yeah -- how'd you know that?
  ans:
  - Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank. It was robbed this morning.

- que:
  - Anything from the bank?
  ans:
  - We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Cut him loose. The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.

- que:
  - When did you get back?
  ans:
  - A few days ago.

- que:
  - Where were you last night around nine?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Around.

- que:
  - And Brenda?
  ans:
  - She was a good woman.

- que:
  - I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.

- que:
  - Is that it?
  ans:
  - No. I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.

- que:
  - Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
  ans:
  - You'll have no need for that, Highlander.

- que:
  - I know that weapon. It belonged to Juan Romeriz. He's dead?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - No. He was my brother. He died at anothers hand.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Thomas Cavenaugh. I am a teacher of sorts. Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sing.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - Life. You've stopped living it. You look, but you do not see. You listen but, you do not hear.

- que:
  - What else? What else do you hear right now?
  ans:
  - The river.

- que:
  - That's all?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Leaving what?
  ans:
  - England. There is nothing for me here anymore.

- que:
  - And what do you think you will find in another land?
  ans:
  - Maybe myself.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.

- que:
  - If it came down to it what would you do?
  ans:
  - I do not know. I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.

- que:
  - The sea and I don't agree with each other. Where we off to?
  ans:
  - France.

- que:
  - Not long. We should arrive in the morning. Are you going to be alright?
  ans:
  - Me? Of course.

- que:
  - Living. Remember?
  ans:
  - You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.

- que:
  - What worries you?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - You've been seeing her for over a month now. Have you learned nothing from the past?
  ans:
  - I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.

- que:
  - No. What am I to do?
  ans:
  - The only thing you can do. You must end it.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - It's done.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think you just like to eat dirt.

- que:
  - I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
  ans:
  - This cannot be.

- que:
  - Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
  ans:
  - I've come to strike a bargain with you. I wish to learn the power of changing.

- que:
  - And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
  ans:
  - Your life.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - We had a bargain. You promised.

- que:
  - Where do you go when your mind drifts?
  ans:
  - Different places.

- que:
  - The past?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'm leaving in the morning.

- que:
  - Leaving? For how long?
  ans:
  - You'll no see me again.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I cannot explain.

- que:
  - Do you love me, Conner?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - Because, it's for the best. There are somethings that are better left unexplained.

- que:
  - Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
  ans:
  - Huge.

- que:
  - You guys are from the British museum, right?
  ans:
  - No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries. It's a syndicated show out of..

- que:
  - Are you a cop?
  ans:
  - No. I'm an archaeologist.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - To talk to you.

- que:
  - Corpses?
  ans:
  - Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.

- que:
  - Yes. How did you know?
  ans:
  - A lucky guess.

- que:
  - Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
  ans:
  - If it's good advice.

- que:
  - Where did you get it?
  ans:
  - It's mine. It's been in my family for years. It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.

- que:
  - What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod?
  ans:
  - Because it's my name.

- que:
  - Then who's Russell Nash?
  ans:
  - I don't know anymore.

- que:
  - Why do you stare at me like that?
  ans:
  - You remind me of someone I used to know.

- que:
  - Who was that man last night?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Do you always walk around with a sword?
  ans:
  - New York is dangerous place.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.

- que:
  - Have you ever heard of the Calan?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I told you I'm interested in mythology. We can talk about it more.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm just trying to place you.

- que:
  - How come you wanted to meet tonight?
  ans:
  - I wanted to get to know you better.

- que:
  - That makes you uncomfortable?
  ans:
  - A little -- yes. My interest in coming here is profession.

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - Why don't you tell me.

- que:
  - Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.

- que:
  - Not unless they're immortal.
  ans:
  - Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't? What if they were trying to get out?

- que:
  - Would you like to see it?
  ans:
  - I've seen it.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - You wanted the truth -- now you have it.

- que:
  - Where will you go now?
  ans:
  - It will end tonight.

- que:
  - Must you fight him?
  ans:
  - He will not stop until it is over.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.

- que:
  - Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
  ans:
  - They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Someone broke into the cavern last night.

- que:
  - What? How?
  ans:
  - He's fine. He swears he never left his post for a moment. He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.

- que:
  - How could they get by him?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What's that next to him?
  ans:
  - His head. Someone cut it off.

- que:
  - You stayed here again last night?
  ans:
  - I was working on the cataloging.

- que:
  - Do you? Then why don't you go out? Meet someone. Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
  ans:
  - I like my work.

- que:
  - It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?
  ans:
  - I do not know -- and even if I did...

- que:
  - Why did you wait?
  ans:
  - It will not end tonight.

- que:
  - It isn't over, is it, Conner?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How can that be?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Is there anything else you need?
  ans:
  - No -- I'm fine. Thank you.

- que:
  - Would you care for some water, Conner?
  ans:
  - Aye -- that I would, lass.

- que:
  - You kept it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I shouldn't have come back here. It was a mistake.

- que:
  - Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
  ans:
  - Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.

- que:
  - I heard voices downstairs. Is everything alright?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - What will you do?
  ans:
  - There's nothing I can do. I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.

- que:
  - Good afternoon... ... Shirley.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Would you like to deposit this in your account?
  ans:
  - No. The money, please.

- que:
  - The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith. They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
  ans:
  - Mike! Mike, can you hear me?

- que:
  - That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside?
  ans:
  - The mother is in Florida visiting her sister. The father works at home, so he's probably inside.

- que:
  - Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs. You understand me, Larry?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - Dead end--it's a clone. What about the Mustang?
  ans:
  - It was stolen.

- que:
  - You get anything on Smith?
  ans:
  - Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
  ans:
  - The best.

- que:
  - Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family. Who's running the show up there?
  ans:
  - Find out how we can hurt him. By the end of the day, I want to own him.

- que:
  - You think we should take that chance?
  ans:
  - I guess not.

- que:
  - What, he's cute? That's his idea of humor?
  ans:
  - If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too. You should let them know.

- que:
  - Who sent you?
  ans:
  - Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine. I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.

- que:
  - C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid. I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
  ans:
  - The car. All you want is the car?

- que:
  - Mars?! Whattaya think, dude? Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
  ans:
  - Try to act cool, okay? He's gonna think you're a dick.

- que:
  - We got jobs, man; we're working. Why even take the chance?
  ans:
  - Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.

- que:
  - Not if they're looking at something else.
  ans:
  - Someone should stay with Mr. Smith. What if he wakes up?

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. That's how we'll stay alive.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm Rooney.

- que:
  - We had an awful lot of shooting. You need a doctor in there?
  ans:
  - We're cool.

- que:
  - How about your two friends? You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
  ans:
  - They're fine.

- que:
  - How about the cop?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I gotta piss real bad.

- que:
  - That you, Talley?
  ans:
  - The one and only. We got a little problem out here, Dennis.

- que:
  - You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
  ans:
  - Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall.

- que:
  - Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
  ans:
  - I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.

- que:
  - Maybe that's what I'm doing. Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
  ans:
  - You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.

- que:
  - Who else is here?
  ans:
  - My father.

- que:
  - Shut up and sit down. You think someone's gonna make a house call?
  ans:
  - They'll cut the power.

- que:
  - You got something to say?
  ans:
  - I like it here, Dennis. I'm never going to leave.

- que:
  - You mean he left, as in went out the front door?
  ans:
  - I overheard him with the girl.

- que:
  - Shit! Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up! Did he take the kids with him?
  ans:
  - That would be Mars Krupchek. Jesus, he works for me, too.

- que:
  - Is Krupchek an aggressive guy? Hot- tempered? Anything like that?
  ans:
  - Keeps to himself, more like.

- que:
  - We have to own this guy, Marion. We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
  ans:
  - You have his address?

- que:
  - Donuts here any good?
  ans:
  - I don't eat junk food.

- que:
  - Are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - You fucked up, Glen.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.

- que:
  - Goddamnit, tell me what you know. Did the cops go in? Did Smith have the disks?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out. He's fucking us over, Glen. That guy is fucking us over.

- que:
  - What hospital?
  ans:
  - Canyon Country.

- que:
  - How did you get this number?
  ans:
  - I have your fucking family. Don't forget that.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family. We'll trade.

- que:
  - Fuck the mall. You know that motel on the road west of town?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
  ans:
  - They're close. Let me make a call. You can see they're okay.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI. This one's a fake.

- que:
  - Can we talk some more when you get here?
  ans:
  - The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.

- que:
  - Want one?
  ans:
  - I don't drink beer.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - We can't make the microwave work.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're hungry. You're going to cook.

- que:
  - How about dog shit?
  ans:
  - Kevin left without you.

- que:
  - You gotta pee?
  ans:
  - I don't see why you can't just lock me in. It's not like I can go anywhere.

- que:
  - Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you. Which do you want?
  ans:
  - Thanks for the shirt.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Keep your voice down. I'm taking you and your brother out of here.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Do you want to go or not? I'm offering you a way out of here.

- que:
  - How can we get out?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
  ans:
  - Are civilians inside?

- que:
  - What are we going to do about Mike?
  ans:
  - Keep your head down.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - York Estates. Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

- que:
  - Is something wrong with Jane?
  ans:
  - We have a boy on the line. He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.

- que:
  - One at a time! Clear the air! Louise? Talk to me. What do we have?
  ans:
  - Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.

- que:
  - Did he say if she was shooting at him?
  ans:
  - He didn't say.

- que:
  - Then we don't know if she's part of this or not. Mickey, you up?
  ans:
  - I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.

- que:
  - Louise?
  ans:
  - Go, Chief.

- que:
  - Louise?
  ans:
  - Go, Chief.

- que:
  - You have her cell number?
  ans:
  - She didn't answer.

- que:
  - Did you find Jane and Mandy?
  ans:
  - Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.

- que:
  - What's wrong with the radio?
  ans:
  - Other people can hear us. Just call. Please.

- que:
  - I've done it once or twice. I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
  ans:
  - I'm Talley. Who's in charge?

- que:
  - Maddox! You got that?
  ans:
  - Then get your men off the wall! You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath! I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.

- que:
  - Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
  ans:
  - No. He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.

- que:
  - -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance! What?
  ans:
  - Let it go, Captain.

- que:
  - Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders. You see it?
  ans:
  - It's right in front of us.

- que:
  - Are all of you named Jones?
  ans:
  - Don't be funny, Chief. You can't afford it.

- que:
  - I asked you my name. You just saw my commission slip. What's my fucking name?
  ans:
  - Special Agent Jones.

- que:
  - What are you people going to do?
  ans:
  - You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call. When he gives the word, we move.

- que:
  - Thomas Smith. I'm in the house that's on TV. Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up. You gotta help him.
  ans:
  - What does he have on you? I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?

- que:
  - Slow down, Thomas. Take it easy and talk to me. Was your father shot?
  ans:
  - Dennis hit him. His head's all big and he won't wake up. I'm really scared.

- que:
  - How about you and your sister?
  ans:
  - We're okay.

- que:
  - Where are you right now?
  ans:
  - In my room.

- que:
  - That's on the second floor. Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - I need your help with something. But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names, Marlon and Al.

- que:
  - I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office. Could you find them and see who they belong to?
  ans:
  - Dennis won't let me go to the desk. He makes me sit on the floor.

- que:
  - Can you get into the office?
  ans:
  - I can get into the den. The office is right across the hall.

- que:
  - If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Can you open them?
  ans:
  - I opened Marlon. I think it's somebody's taxes.

- que:
  - Look for names. Does it say whose taxes they are?
  ans:
  - They're still in the house.

- que:
  - Did you find the disks?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where's your gun?
  ans:
  - I'm the Chief. I don't carry it.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Follow the Mustang. We won't go far.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out. It's for your own good.

- que:
  - Can we let go? You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
  ans:
  - You can let go.

- que:
  - These disks ... where are they?
  ans:
  - Smith will know.

- que:
  - VOICE My people are good to go. You know who I mean?
  ans:
  - Your phony FBI assholes.

- que:
  - What do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - VOICE You don't want another dead child on your conscience.

- que:
  - Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, it's a private function.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.

- que:
  - We, who is we?
  ans:
  - A delegation.

- que:
  - Cockroaches?
  ans:
  - No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Leave it to me.

- que:
  - Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.

- que:
  - What is this about?
  ans:
  - Let me see your identity card.

- que:
  - You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
  ans:
  - No. I work at the Mille Collines.

- que:
  - Where is your family?
  ans:
  - They are all Tutsi cockroaches.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Name a price.

- que:
  - How many in your family?
  ans:
  - Six.

- que:
  - And four children?
  ans:
  - I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.

- que:
  - Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
  ans:
  - No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.

- que:
  - We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.

- que:
  - If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
  ans:
  - Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.

- que:
  - Have you requested re-enforcements?
  ans:
  - Yes we have.

- que:
  - What was the response?
  ans:
  - We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.

- que:
  - Paul, you know who this is?
  ans:
  - Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.

- que:
  - Yes sir, but these people they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
  ans:
  - They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Anything. Strong.

- que:
  - Canadian Club?
  ans:
  - Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.

- que:
  - Their people?
  ans:
  - They're only taking the whites.

- que:
  - Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
  ans:
  - I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.

- que:
  - I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
  ans:
  - No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.

- que:
  - The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you. Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
  ans:
  - Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.

- que:
  - What did you overhear?
  ans:
  - A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.

- que:
  - What did they say?
  ans:
  - The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.

- que:
  - Satellites?
  ans:
  - Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.

- que:
  - And what will they do with these satellites?
  ans:
  - The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.

- que:
  - The high command? Our high command?
  ans:
  - Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.

- que:
  - If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
  ans:
  - The front gate would be best, General.

- que:
  - I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
  ans:
  - I am strong, Paul, like a lion.

- que:
  - Where are my supplies?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.

- que:
  - You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
  ans:
  - No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.

- que:
  - Whiskey?
  ans:
  - The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.

- que:
  - Your police are at the gate?
  ans:
  - After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.

- que:
  - Where are they going?
  ans:
  - They can go where they want. They are in charge now.

- que:
  - What do you mean, General?
  ans:
  - We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Today.

- que:
  - You know what the Scottish call it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
  ans:
  - Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.

- que:
  - I am on a list! What list?
  ans:
  - When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.

- que:
  - You think they will believe you?
  ans:
  - You will tell them the truth.

- que:
  - Business is good at the hotel?
  ans:
  - Very good.

- que:
  - Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
  ans:
  - I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.

- que:
  - What do you mean George?
  ans:
  - Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.

- que:
  - Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
  ans:
  - We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.

- que:
  - Lets go, Jock.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
  ans:
  - Youre drunk.

- que:
  - When will they be here?
  ans:
  - Very soon.

- que:
  - Gregoire, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Get out of this room and get back to work.

- que:
  - Where are we going, sir?
  ans:
  - For supplies, you drive.

- que:
  - Are you sure this is the river road?
  ans:
  - I saw the sign.

- que:
  - Paul, how the hell are ya'?
  ans:
  - I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.

- que:
  - They moved you from the Diplomat?
  ans:
  - Promoted. House Manager.

- que:
  - Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.

- que:
  - Can we phone them in, Paul?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.

- que:
  - This goes out live?
  ans:
  - Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. What is wrong?
  ans:
  - Everyone must leave the hotel now.

- que:
  - Why sir?
  ans:
  - It's an order. Get everyone out now.

- que:
  - Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
  ans:
  - The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.

- que:
  - Don't lie to me. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Our cards, please.

- que:
  - What cards?
  ans:
  - You have our cards.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - One thousand francs.

- que:
  - Was there blood?
  ans:
  - No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.

- que:
  - Move? Where to?
  ans:
  - I'm going to put you on the third floor.

- que:
  - Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
  ans:
  - I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.

- que:
  - Your brother's here?
  ans:
  - Yes, with Fedens and the children.

- que:
  - Thomas wants advice?
  ans:
  - He wants your wisdom.

- que:
  - Homework?
  ans:
  - Do something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.

- que:
  - Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
  ans:
  - I couldn't help.

- que:
  - No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
  ans:
  - Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.

- que:
  - Where are Thomas and Fedens?
  ans:
  - I sent them home. Go and call them.

- que:
  - Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
  ans:
  - What is it, Paul.

- que:
  - Any luck?
  ans:
  - No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.

- que:
  - Has Roger spoken yet?
  ans:
  - No, Odette says he's in shock.

- que:
  - He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
  ans:
  - Give him time.

- que:
  - What about us?
  ans:
  - We have been abandoned.

- que:
  - But who is left?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.

- que:
  - What are you saying, Tatsi?
  ans:
  - Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.

- que:
  - So where is the lamb?
  ans:
  - Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - We're running out of beer and other supplies.

- que:
  - Go out! Where?
  ans:
  - To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.

- que:
  - Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
  ans:
  - It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.

- que:
  - I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
  ans:
  - A kiss.

- que:
  - In Ruhengeri?
  ans:
  - Yes, when you worked as the nurse.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To be closer. So that I could marry you.

- que:
  - What was the bribe? What am I worth to you?
  ans:
  - It was substantial.

- que:
  - What sort of car?
  ans:
  - What does it matter.

- que:
  - A little longer, Paul?
  ans:
  - We wait until 7,00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.

- que:
  - What sort of plan?
  ans:
  - Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I have to go to the Diplomat.

- que:
  - Can I have your name again?
  ans:
  - Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.

- que:
  - What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
  ans:
  - It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.

- que:
  - That is why they call it coach?
  ans:
  - Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.

- que:
  - You have taken business class?
  ans:
  - Many times.

- que:
  - Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
  ans:
  - He has taken the presidential suite.

- que:
  - What do we do with all these people?
  ans:
  - Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - The lieutenant wants the register.

- que:
  - Where has all our beer gone?
  ans:
  - Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.

- que:
  - How much beer?
  ans:
  - Many beers.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - As the trucks go.

- que:
  - What is this about no water?
  ans:
  - It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.

- que:
  - Paul. Are you alright?
  ans:
  - We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.

- que:
  - Out? Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.

- que:
  - All. What do you mean all?
  ans:
  - The staff, the guests.

- que:
  - The staff and guests! How many?
  ans:
  - Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.

- que:
  - Paul, are you there?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you Mr. President.

- que:
  - Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
  ans:
  - The French. They supply the Rwandan army.

- que:
  - Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
  ans:
  - No, I don't want you going on the street.

- que:
  - Who is this Simon?
  ans:
  - There are soldiers.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - On the street.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.

- que:
  - What is his room number?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - -- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
  ans:
  - Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...

- que:
  - Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago?
  ans:
  - It was on my Dad's list of \"things to do.\" But the House did him first.

- que:
  - -- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
  ans:
  - Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.

- que:
  - Just for the record, what are the rest of your names?
  ans:
  - Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.

- que:
  - Is she alright?
  ans:
  - Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.

- que:
  - Oh, really, who?
  ans:
  - I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.

- que:
  - You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
  ans:
  - I wanna know first, to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.

- que:
  - I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
  ans:
  - You're totally full of shit, aren't you?

- que:
  - So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
  ans:
  - A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9,30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.

- que:
  - What's in there?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?

- que:
  - What's down there?
  ans:
  - The...Fourth of July.

- que:
  - What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
  ans:
  - Oh. Jesus.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!

- que:
  - Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
  ans:
  - Pritchett, is that you?

- que:
  - And we get this money when?
  ans:
  - This is nuts.

- que:
  - Prove it how?
  ans:
  - Oh, Jesus....

- que:
  - Is she...alright?
  ans:
  - I thought she was dead. For sure.

- que:
  - You need to get out more.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - What? Deep down inside?
  ans:
  - Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.

- que:
  - What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
  ans:
  - An answer, I hope, exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.

- que:
  - I think we should have taken a right back there.
  ans:
  - And then where are we?

- que:
  - Back where?
  ans:
  - Good point.

- que:
  - What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - This is the best we're gonna do.

- que:
  - He's dead...?
  ans:
  - Don't think it's even an issue.

- que:
  - It's succeeding!
  ans:
  - We're safe?

- que:
  - Where did it go?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.

- que:
  - ...Jesus H. Christ.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - You've got your own TV show?
  ans:
  - The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.

- que:
  - So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
  ans:
  - I hope not.

- que:
  - How'd you make your guest list, Price, throw darts at a phone book?
  ans:
  - Oh, I think we're going to have several.

- que:
  - I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
  ans:
  - I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven, Round One, you win.

- que:
  - Then who are they?
  ans:
  - You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but, bravo.

- que:
  - Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
  ans:
  - It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.

- que:
  - So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
  ans:
  - Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.

- que:
  - And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
  ans:
  - A simple leak, if it's okay with you.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Stalking the wild poltergeist.

- que:
  - Well, who's the damn thing from?
  ans:
  - Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.

- que:
  - -- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
  ans:
  - You didn't think to ask?

- que:
  - -- well, here's a better one, you're fired.
  ans:
  - You think this is fucking funny?

- que:
  - Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - And then what happens?
  ans:
  - I think it's something better experienced then described.

- que:
  - You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What're you talking about?
  ans:
  - Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.

- que:
  - If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
  ans:
  - Fascinated.

- que:
  - Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
  ans:
  - Then who did?

- que:
  - Of course he did, for God's sake. Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
  ans:
  - I can't comment until I get paid.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Don't know that it does.

- que:
  - Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
  ans:
  - Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Believe me, we need to.

- que:
  - Ghosts killed your father?
  ans:
  - Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...

- que:
  - And you think it's in there?
  ans:
  - Accumulated evil... festering for decades... But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.

- que:
  - You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
  ans:
  - Blackburn's dead.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - He would have been back by now.

- que:
  - Over here.
  ans:
  - Pritchett, what is going on?

- que:
  - I feel something. It's faint, but...it's there...
  ans:
  - Please.....anyone....help me?

- que:
  - You say you saw some activity here?
  ans:
  - Damn it.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - These records only go back to 1880. But... ...wait a minute...

- que:
  - Did you find something?
  ans:
  - It doesn't say. But that's not what interests me. There's no death certificate for the daughter. Anywhere.

- que:
  - What was her name?
  ans:
  - Colleen.

- que:
  - So many unanswered questions. Why was she buried there. And who killed her?
  ans:
  - It might have been her mother.

- que:
  - What will they tell you?
  ans:
  - I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously. And who died here.

- que:
  - Thank you. If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here?
  ans:
  - No, I live about in Wexford. It's about a five hour drive.

- que:
  - How did you meet Dr. Shea?
  ans:
  - I have to admit I was skeptical. Until now.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - A few years older, perhaps.

- que:
  - How's your arm?
  ans:
  - It will heal.

- que:
  - Where does this amulet come from?
  ans:
  - By freeing them.

- que:
  - What do these ingredients mean?
  ans:
  - Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...

- que:
  - Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Can I do it again tonight?
  ans:
  - We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.

- que:
  - Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can you talk to her?
  ans:
  - She talks to me.

- que:
  - Are we leaving mommy?
  ans:
  - Yes, we'll be leaving soon.

- que:
  - Where are we going to go, mommy?
  ans:
  - We're going to go someplace new.

- que:
  - What about all my other stuff?
  ans:
  - We'll get it later.

- que:
  - She says she's lonely...
  ans:
  - H-how long will it take?

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - She's here.

- que:
  - Where is she now?
  ans:
  - I want this one, daddy.

- que:
  - What's he doing daddy?
  ans:
  - He's blessing the house.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - For good luck honey.

- que:
  - Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
  ans:
  - That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life.

- que:
  - Are we going back to California daddy?
  ans:
  - Well, that all depends.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.

- que:
  - What will Aubrey think?
  ans:
  - Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

- que:
  - Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
  ans:
  - Or what she was worth.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's not going to work. I'm too smart for you.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's strange.

- que:
  - Were you fooling with the power?
  ans:
  - It was in the cellar. Weird.

- que:
  - So what are you saying?
  ans:
  - I don't know what I'm saying.

- que:
  - But do you agree with me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.

- que:
  - Well what do you think it is?
  ans:
  - Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - She has a...friend. Colleen.

- que:
  - A friend?
  ans:
  - You, an imaginary friend. That's what she calls her.

- que:
  - How are we doing?
  ans:
  - You seem to appreciate the local scenery.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - I'm ok.

- que:
  - What do you mean, unfortunately?
  ans:
  - We usually find nothing. We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.

- que:
  - What about the other five percent?
  ans:
  - Where is your daughter? She might be able to give us some information.

- que:
  - Ok, so we have a...presence. What do we do about it?
  ans:
  - If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.

- que:
  - I'm not sure, but I can check. Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
  ans:
  - Before.

- que:
  - Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
  ans:
  - White meat will be fine...

- que:
  - May I come in?
  ans:
  - Thank you. I believe she would have wanted it.

- que:
  - Did you know her very well?
  ans:
  - She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.

- que:
  - The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - So what should we do, father?
  ans:
  - Go ahead. I believe right now she may hear you.

- que:
  - And you...are?
  ans:
  - My name is Father Seamus. I'm from Holy Rood church.

- que:
  - What was she afraid of?
  ans:
  - Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul. She would hear things, see things...

- que:
  - I didn't do anything...God saved her...
  ans:
  - What...amulet?

- que:
  - What's going to happen?
  ans:
  - I wish I had an answer. Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems. But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.

- que:
  - And what would you do?
  ans:
  - Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.

- que:
  - So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
  ans:
  - Not someone. Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.

- que:
  - Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
  ans:
  - Not really. Oh, wait a minute.

- que:
  - Where did you find this?
  ans:
  - It was nailed to the cellar wall.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I borrow it?
  ans:
  - Not at all, if it can help.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean hardly any thigh. I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - You wanted a story. You got it. Turn on the TV now. And then get your ass down here ... ...

- que:
  - It's ... I don't know. First World War, right?
  ans:
  - Correct. The fields of France. And many dead flowers ... Oh. Forgive me. My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser. Captain.

- que:
  - And what did you discover?
  ans:
  - Something bad.

- que:
  - What can we do?
  ans:
  - I like you, Joey. You ask all the right questions. There is something we can do but it will require great courage.

- que:
  - So where is it?
  ans:
  - Your apartment.

- que:
  - Wha .... ?
  ans:
  - The Box, Joey. He wants the Box.

- que:
  - What happened to him?
  ans:
  - Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you.

- que:
  - Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.

- que:
  - Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight?
  ans:
  - Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.

- que:
  - Why are you so interested?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Oh, right. Did he used to ... ?
  ans:
  - That's great.

- que:
  - Great. Thanks. You gonna have one?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to quit.

- que:
  - Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever?
  ans:
  - Sorry. It was my father's. It's temperamental.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
  ans:
  - Yeah! That's what I'm saying! And it was lying next to him. And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...

- que:
  - Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...

- que:
  - Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this ... exploratory?
  ans:
  - The bank owns it. But I'm working on it.

- que:
  - How have you ... ?
  ans:
  - Guys. Sometimes friends. Mostly guys.

- que:
  - Wow. Lotta books. You read all these?
  ans:
  - No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them.

- que:
  - And he still sits there?
  ans:
  - Every day.

- que:
  - Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured ...

- que:
  - Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid?
  ans:
  - No. JP. My last boyfriend? He like owns the club. You know? You were there? He bought the statue.

- que:
  - Sure. Why?
  ans:
  - It's Saturday morning. Let's go shopping.

- que:
  - Buying some drugs, alright?
  ans:
  - God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues.

- que:
  - Joey ... ?
  ans:
  - Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale.

- que:
  - Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?
  ans:
  - It was part of a job-lot. Some loony- bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff.

- que:
  - What else came with it? Anything still here?
  ans:
  - Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.

- que:
  - You gonna buy?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - A prize? For what?
  ans:
  - You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...

- que:
  - He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - No. Really?
  ans:
  - Yes really.

- que:
  - Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
  ans:
  - Unh-unh.

- que:
  - You shit. Who do you think you are?
  ans:
  - I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.

- que:
  - What ... What ... ?
  ans:
  - What did you see? The same as I. Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You saw the working of the world in miniature.

- que:
  - On the contrary. It has everything to do with the world. And our dreams of how it will succumb to us. You enjoyed the girl?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Don't flee from yourself. If you have a quality, let it define you. Cultivate it. It is you. By helping me, you will help yourse...
  ans:
  - I understand. Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional. What else could you do?

- que:
  - What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you?
  ans:
  - Hey, that's what makes the world go round.

- que:
  - How do we start?
  ans:
  - It has already begun.

- que:
  - Joey?
  ans:
  - Not quite.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah really. I'm ...

- que:
  - You're apologizing?
  ans:
  - Well ... of course I have. I've thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me ...

- que:
  - Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't ...

- que:
  - Not now, no. I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Yeah right. Look ...

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes! God, yes. I ... I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's alright.

- que:
  - That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom. Sorry I was late. Miss anything?
  ans:
  - Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable... Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.

- que:
  - So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
  ans:
  - Oh, not much. Mario Brothers want me to do a job.

- que:
  - Cameras?
  ans:
  - No need. Guards' station's right there.

- que:
  - Did I miss anything?
  ans:
  - Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.

- que:
  - Geez, Gates was killed. Who do we send the thank you note to?
  ans:
  - Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

- que:
  - Why try?
  ans:
  - You re not thinking of going to...

- que:
  - Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense. Where's your tux?
  ans:
  - You bastard. You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.

- que:
  - No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of my life. What was your per-diem?
  ans:
  - We're going in from the ground floor.

- que:
  - Why not just go now?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Last rites, sister?
  ans:
  - How.

- que:
  - With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
  ans:
  - No, your Eminence. I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.

- que:
  - Sorry. Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
  ans:
  - That's the best kind. A wise woman once said \"Polite conversation is rarely either.\"

- que:
  - Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
  ans:
  - Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

- que:
  - Whoa, part 2. Does it go to Times Square?
  ans:
  - The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.

- que:
  - How long were you in?
  ans:
  - Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

- que:
  - What have you been doing?
  ans:
  - The C.I. what? God, no...

- que:
  - Where did you get this?
  ans:
  - You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.

- que:
  - Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God. But you're a close second, tough guy. What is that smile?
  ans:
  - I got my planet back.

- que:
  - And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
  ans:
  - It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over. Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.

- que:
  - Cat got his tongue?
  ans:
  - Actually he never told us what it was.

- que:
  - Baseball, why?
  ans:
  - Good job, not pretty, but good.

- que:
  - Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
  ans:
  - Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.

- que:
  - That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch. What was our bet? A million?
  ans:
  - Million five, lover...

- que:
  - You could host American Bandstand in here. Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
  ans:
  - Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.

- que:
  - If you're pausing for a \"thank you,\" give it up. So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
  ans:
  - What a pleasant surprise. You're probably wondering...

- que:
  - What job?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
  ans:
  - All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.

- que:
  - So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
  ans:
  - You've got a dilemma, tiger. I think I know what's going to help you solve it.

- que:
  - Hush. My employer wants a meeting.
  ans:
  - Except yours-yours. The goal of world domination. Well, if you put it that way, Minnie. How can I resist?

- que:
  - I'm supposed to fall for that?
  ans:
  - Shucks. Guess not.

- que:
  - No. But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
  ans:
  - Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
  ans:
  - I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.

- que:
  - ...Hello?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, really, I --

- que:
  - Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
  ans:
  - Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

- que:
  - Confused?
  ans:
  - I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

- que:
  - Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
  ans:
  - Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.

- que:
  - ...You do?
  ans:
  - You know, on farm route 17.

- que:
  - What a beautiful thought.
  ans:
  - Every year?

- que:
  - Never mind about that...
  ans:
  - What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?

- que:
  - You mean you know about this?
  ans:
  - Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.

- que:
  - I tell ya the guy's a phony.
  ans:
  - Worked in a watch factory?

- que:
  - Phony, huh?
  ans:
  - As a three-dollar bill.

- que:
  - Sez who?
  ans:
  - Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...

- que:
  - How long've you been down here?
  ans:
  - Forty-eight years...

- que:
  - What the heck they doin'?
  ans:
  - You know what they're doin' now, Lou.

- que:
  - Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
  ans:
  - ...What's your pleasure, buddy?

- que:
  - ...You don't?
  ans:
  - Nah, that's all forgotten.

- que:
  - ...It is?
  ans:
  - Norville.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.

- que:
  - ...This'll only take a moment.
  ans:
  - -- tough titty toenails!

- que:
  - Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
  ans:
  - Well, frankly, I...

- que:
  - All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
  ans:
  - Well, I made the dean's list.

- que:
  - ...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
  ans:
  - Not even behind your back?

- que:
  - No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
  ans:
  - How's that, Sid?

- que:
  - Ya get the special?
  ans:
  - Fah from it...

- que:
  - She must have been beautiful. What happened to her, Alma?
  ans:
  - She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.

- que:
  - Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
  ans:
  - What's this?

- que:
  - What do you mean -- \"doctors that are people\"?
  ans:
  - There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - At the Houmfort.

- que:
  - You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
  ans:
  - No. She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica. But the Houngan cured her.

- que:
  - Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
  ans:
  - Yes, Miss Betsy. I mean that. The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.

- que:
  - Alive?
  ans:
  - No, miss. He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.

- que:
  - But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
  ans:
  - If you say, miss. If you say.

- que:
  - Ti-Joseph?
  ans:
  - I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell. I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.

- que:
  - Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl. What are you driving at?
  ans:
  - I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been \"mindless\"...

- que:
  - You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
  ans:
  - But how did you get here? What are you doing here?

- que:
  - Does she suffer?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.

- que:
  - She can never be cured?
  ans:
  - I've never heard of a cure.

- que:
  - Is this disease common in the tropics?
  ans:
  - I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.

- que:
  - You're single?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where were you trained?
  ans:
  - At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.

- que:
  - That will mean another interview, won't it?
  ans:
  - No, this is quite final. You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter. He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.

- que:
  - The West Indies?
  ans:
  - A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.

- que:
  - That's rather nice, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes -- on the boat.

- que:
  - Is she a doctor?
  ans:
  - No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother. You'll like her.

- que:
  - Thank you. But who sits there?
  ans:
  - My brother's wife.

- que:
  - -- But, you're an American?
  ans:
  - I went to school in Buffalo. Paul went to school in England.

- que:
  - Mr. Holland?
  ans:
  - Yes, the redoubtable Paul. He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.

- que:
  - Where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - It's my day off.

- que:
  - I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
  ans:
  - Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find. I'd better come along and show you the town.

- que:
  - But don't you have to work?
  ans:
  - By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.

- que:
  - What in the world are you talking about? Six ounces -- ?
  ans:
  - Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.

- que:
  - How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
  ans:
  - I'm a nurse. I always watch people when they pour something. I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.

- que:
  - That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
  ans:
  - Did you hear what he sang?

- que:
  - Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
  ans:
  - Of course, Wes.

- que:
  - Does she suffer? Does she know what she is?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.

- que:
  - Have the servants made you comfortable?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you.

- que:
  - Can't I take it for you?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.

- que:
  - I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
  ans:
  - A figure of St. Sebastian.

- que:
  - A mental case?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry...

- que:
  - I suppose so. Yes.
  ans:
  - You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?

- que:
  - And charming?
  ans:
  - I've never given it much thought.

- que:
  - Why did you come in here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.

- que:
  - What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband? Do you love that?
  ans:
  - You didn't drive her mad.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.

- que:
  - Help me? How?
  ans:
  - I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort. I thought they might cure her.

- que:
  - You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life. There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity. Why did you do it?
  ans:
  - I told you.

- que:
  - Because you wanted to give my wife back to me? Why should that mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - You know why. You saw it the other night at the piano. You turned away from me.

- que:
  - You want that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
  ans:
  - Ah -- that's where reason took hold.

- que:
  - But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
  ans:
  - You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?

- que:
  - An accident at the mill?
  ans:
  - No -- it's about Mrs. Holland. A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.

- que:
  - Investigation of what?
  ans:
  - Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness. And, of course, the events which led up to it.

- que:
  - To the asylum?
  ans:
  - I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.

- que:
  - You're wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine -- all of it.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
  ans:
  - Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort. Tell them what you saw there.

- que:
  - Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
  ans:
  - Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.

- que:
  - Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. Say, where's the wife?
  ans:
  - In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.

- que:
  - OK, OK, the defense rests. Want another?
  ans:
  - No thank you. We should be off.

- que:
  - Why shouldn't she be?
  ans:
  - Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...

- que:
  - So maybe you'll come too?
  ans:
  - Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.

- que:
  - So early?
  ans:
  - Rough day. Good night.

- que:
  - Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
  ans:
  - Hmm. Good night.

- que:
  - Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
  ans:
  - Um, yes.

- que:
  - I do. I'm -- are you...?
  ans:
  - I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.

- que:
  - The turkey in?
  ans:
  - Stuffed and baking.

- que:
  - So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
  ans:
  - Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.

- que:
  - What's for dessert?
  ans:
  - See for yourself.

- que:
  - No advice from the experts, huh?
  ans:
  - Don't start.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Don't be dim.

- que:
  - Elena, what are you're talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm not surprised.

- que:
  - Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
  ans:
  - It's a starting place.

- que:
  - Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
  ans:
  - Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?

- que:
  - Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
  ans:
  - I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.

- que:
  - Ready to go?
  ans:
  - We're not going anywhere.

- que:
  - Ben.
  ans:
  - Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?

- que:
  - Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
  ans:
  - We'll talk in the morning.

- que:
  - Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
  ans:
  - I'm fine dad.

- que:
  - So how's school treating you?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - Classes?
  ans:
  - Good.

- que:
  - Grades?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
  ans:
  - Libbets. Libbets Casey.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.

- que:
  - After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
  ans:
  - In a bit.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Birth control.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - A prior engagement overcame me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --

- que:
  - I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - What you been up to?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Your toes cold?
  ans:
  - That's besides the point.

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.

- que:
  - A key party?
  ans:
  - I suppose we'll make an appearance.

- que:
  - And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
  ans:
  - Let me.

- que:
  - Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --

- que:
  - Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Yeah. You?
  ans:
  - Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Nobody.

- que:
  - Mikey Williams?
  ans:
  - We were just riding around.

- que:
  - Mom. Are you ok?
  ans:
  - Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.

- que:
  - I suppose. Why?
  ans:
  - Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.

- que:
  - What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
  ans:
  - Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.

- que:
  - How'd you know?
  ans:
  - Educated guess.

- que:
  - Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
  ans:
  - They say you never forget.

- que:
  - Forget what?
  ans:
  - Forget how to ride a bike.

- que:
  - You ask what the point is?

  ans:
  - It feels warm.

- que:
  - One more shot?

  ans:
  - Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.

- que:
  - This murder was in the papers, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah. All over.

- que:
  - Who's playing?

  ans:
  - Anything. It's important.

- que:
  - What time was that?
  ans:
  - Around twelve-thirty.

- que:
  - Who was the last one to see her alive?
  ans:
  - Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.

- que:
  - We're sure it's hers?
  ans:
  - Has her books in it.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I told her to come.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I beeped you over two hours ago.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - This is a local writer. Kay had all his books. I think we should check it out.

- que:
  - Where you signed this?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What happened at that signing?
  ans:
  - She flattered me about my writing. Asked if she could visit me. To talk about my books.

- que:
  - Did she?
  ans:
  - Yes. Not that much at first. But then she became more comfortable. Started visiting me every week...

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - That boyfriend. Randy.

- que:
  - Randy Stetz?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Are you sure about that?
  ans:
  - Eight years.

- que:
  - What do you want to talk about?
  ans:
  - You know what about.

- que:
  - Will?
  ans:
  - I wish I could stick it out like you. I just, with Trish and the kids...

- que:
  - Fred Duggar?
  ans:
  - No. He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.

- que:
  - What did he look like?
  ans:
  - Will...I...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - There's a guy down the hall. Complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep.

- que:
  - One of your cases?
  ans:
  - Will.

- que:
  - What if someone finds out?
  ans:
  - We're under investigation now. Back in Seattle. Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got back. Thought he could work out some kind of deal.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - You heard me that time.

- que:
  - Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
  ans:
  - Stuff.

- que:
  - What kind of stuff?
  ans:
  - Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.

- que:
  - The other guy?
  ans:
  - I told you I don't remember.

- que:
  - What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
  ans:
  - I was her best friend.

- que:
  - Best friend?
  ans:
  - Since grade school.

- que:
  - You want me to take you somewhere?
  ans:
  - Long as it's fun.

- que:
  - You and Kay were like sisters?
  ans:
  - That's what I said.

- que:
  - Told each other everything. That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
  ans:
  - She used some stupid code name.

- que:
  - The phone call. The knapsack.
  ans:
  - What was it?

- que:
  - I'm sorry?
  ans:
  - I said you're going to get a phone call.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.

- que:
  - Down at the station?
  ans:
  - Yes down at the station.

- que:
  - Did you have sex with her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - He. Well, he...

- que:
  - What the hell do you know?
  ans:
  - Kay told me. She comes to me, you know. Tells me things. About you. About me.

- que:
  - Couldn't get it up, Walter?
  ans:
  - Yes. Like that.

- que:
  - This an accident, Walter?
  ans:
  - If you want it to be...

- que:
  - Where's your back-up?
  ans:
  - No back-up.

- que:
  - But how did you come into existence?
  ans:
  - You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.

- que:
  - Are you the leader of tis group?
  ans:
  - If there were a leader, I would be the one.

- que:
  - What are we?
  ans:
  - Nothing if not vampires...

- que:
  - Who made us what we are?
  ans:
  - Surely you know the one who made you...

- que:
  - You mean we are not children of Satan?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
  ans:
  - My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.

- que:
  - But why?
  ans:
  - I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.

- que:
  - So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
  ans:
  - You said there were none.

- que:
  - We can do that?
  ans:
  - That's what the one who made me said.

- que:
  - And the vampires of the Theatre?
  ans:
  - Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.

- que:
  - Are these not the answers you came for?
  ans:
  - Yes... My God...

- que:
  - Not without Claudia. Where is she?
  ans:
  - I can't save her.

- que:
  - You didn't even warm them, did you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
  ans:
  - We are a pair, and that's what counts.

- que:
  - What night? What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.

- que:
  - Is this my birthday?
  ans:
  - Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.

- que:
  - Does it?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.

- que:
  - Is that supposed to frighten me?
  ans:
  - You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.

- que:
  - What plans?
  ans:
  - I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.

- que:
  - Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
  ans:
  - Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.

- que:
  - Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
  ans:
  - No. Laudanum.

- que:
  - How did you learn to write, Claudia?
  ans:
  - The way I learn everything. By watching you.

- que:
  - Why does he call you that?
  ans:
  - Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - We're immortal. You've always known that.

- que:
  - You both did it?
  ans:
  - I took your life. He gave you another one.

- que:
  - Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
  ans:
  - Don't mock, Claudia...

- que:
  - How do I look?
  ans:
  - Still my beautiful child.

- que:
  - A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
  ans:
  - You don't remember? Or you never knew.

- que:
  - Or her, or her - or any of them?
  ans:
  - No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.

- que:
  - Love?
  ans:
  - You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.

- que:
  - Yes...
  ans:
  - You really believe that?

- que:
  - And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
  ans:
  - She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - They would have killed you -

- que:
  - You want death? Is it death you want?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
  ans:
  - Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?

- que:
  - How do you mean, start?
  ans:
  - Call him.

- que:
  - I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
  ans:
  - I can't go through with it, I tell you.

- que:
  - But why do you want me?
  ans:
  - Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.

- que:
  - Did I hear a yes?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - Sure...

- que:
  - Dying?
  ans:
  - Come, you're going to feed now.

- que:
  - What have I done?
  ans:
  - You have fed. You were made for this...

- que:
  - Dear God, what have I done?
  ans:
  - You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.

- que:
  - And if I don't?
  ans:
  - The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.

- que:
  - Do you think so?
  ans:
  - I know. It gets cold so fast.

- que:
  - We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
  ans:
  - Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.

- que:
  - But how do you know?
  ans:
  - Read her thoughts.

- que:
  - Paris? You came from Paris?
  ans:
  - But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...

- que:
  - Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
  ans:
  - We belong in hell.

- que:
  - What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
  ans:
  - I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.

- que:
  - What do you imagine you are Louis?
  ans:
  - I don't pretend to know.

- que:
  - That and more.
  ans:
  - Why do you do this Lestat?

- que:
  - Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
  ans:
  - Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...

- que:
  - Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
  ans:
  - Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...

- que:
  - Are you mad?
  ans:
  - You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.

- que:
  - You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
  ans:
  - You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.

- que:
  - Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
  ans:
  - It's just a room...

- que:
  - So shall we begin? What do yo do?
  ans:
  - I'm a vampire.

- que:
  - See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.

- que:
  - You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
  ans:
  - Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.

- que:
  - You're not lying to me, are you?
  ans:
  - Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.

- que:
  - Oh, that rumour about crosses?
  ans:
  - You can't look at them...

- que:
  - The story about stakes through the heart?
  ans:
  - The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.

- que:
  - What about coffins?
  ans:
  - Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...

- que:
  - Can a vampire feel love?
  ans:
  - You loved your wife, surely.

- que:
  - He did it to make you stay with him!
  ans:
  - Shall we go on?

- que:
  - But why did you tell her?
  ans:
  - How could I not? She had to know.

- que:
  - And did you lose her? Did she go?
  ans:
  - Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...

- que:
  - Did he die in the fire?
  ans:
  - He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.

- que:
  - No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
  ans:
  - Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...

- que:
  - Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - You promise to care for her then?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - And you know what you ask for?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
  ans:
  - A child who can't die...

- que:
  - And the child who did die?
  ans:
  - My daughter...

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - Checking in...Karla Wilson.

- que:
  - Is that bad?
  ans:
  - Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.

- que:
  - Wait...Did you say off-season?
  ans:
  - July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.

- que:
  - What about a radio?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Emergencies only.

- que:
  - What the hell would you call this?
  ans:
  - We haven't exchanged anything.

- que:
  - Storm season?
  ans:
  - It's our version of winter. 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.

- que:
  - Who? Who is here?
  ans:
  - I want off this island.

- que:
  - You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
  ans:
  - Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.

- que:
  - Stupid. What were you thinkng?
  ans:
  - That could break the machine.

- que:
  - You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
  ans:
  - Ray, come on. I want us to be together.

- que:
  - Not me...no way...
  ans:
  - Hello? Hello?

- que:
  - Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?

  ans:
  - Nice move.

- que:
  - What do you mean?

  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Julie?
  ans:
  - I'm right here. Grab my hand.

- que:
  - I got in early. I was excited... Who was that guy?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.

- que:
  - Why are you being like this?
  ans:
  - Ray, I can't...

- que:
  - Can't what?
  ans:
  - I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...

- que:
  - This weekend?
  ans:
  - Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.

- que:
  - Will you try...for me, please?
  ans:
  - Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.

- que:
  - Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you?
  ans:
  - Never do that again.

- que:
  - Checking the locks again?
  ans:
  - You know me to well.

- que:
  - That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?
  ans:
  - I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Ben Willis.

  - You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:

  ans:
  - It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.

- que:
  - To get out of Southport?
  ans:
  - Right. Now I remember.

  - Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school... Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm okay.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - This was not my idea.

- que:
  - I said, this...Do you want a drink?
  ans:
  - Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.

  - You sure it's okay with you?
  ans:

  - What? What are you talking about? Where?

- que:
  - Did you get help?
  ans:
  - Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.

- que:
  - He's in it with Willis?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this to me?
  ans:
  - I trusted you.

- que:
  - ...Why?
  ans:
  - Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.

- que:
  - Is there a problem here?
  ans:
  - Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.

- que:
  - They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. Am I right, sister?
  ans:
  - Tha's it. I've decided. I'm changing my major to finance. And going to Wall Street.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.

- que:
  - Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
  ans:
  - I'm not hiding up no tree. I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.

- que:
  - You think that's a good place to hide?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but I'm starving.

- que:
  - Alone. In the room. Got any advise?
  ans:
  - Why? He can't help us.

- que:
  - Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country?
  ans:
  - Well, there's some flaws in her...

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Don't really have the market for something like this... I can go two...two-fifty.

- que:
  - You guys lost?
  ans:
  - Tell me this ain't the bar scene.

- que:
  - What's the matter, boy trouble?
  ans:
  - Not anymore.

- que:
  - He leave you?
  ans:
  - No. I shot him.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.

- que:
  - Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
  ans:
  - The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.

- que:
  - So why are you still here?
  ans:
  - There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.

- que:
  - How's the water?
  ans:
  - Crowded.

- que:
  - Where is everybody?
  ans:
  - Take this.

- que:
  - And do what with it?
  ans:
  - They were cut loose.

- que:
  - Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
  ans:
  - Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?

- que:
  - We'll only be a second, okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.

- que:
  - What is up with that weirdo?
  ans:
  - She's in her room.

- que:
  - You collect these to sell, abroad?
  ans:
  - He's dead. I want the General to see him.

- que:
  - I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
  ans:
  - This was once a cemetery.

- que:
  - All the graves?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.

- que:
  - Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
  ans:
  - Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow. I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.

- que:
  - Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
  ans:
  - I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..

- que:
  - You're not leaving tomorrow..?
  ans:
  - I think not.

- que:
  - If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days. I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
  ans:
  - I don't know now without my father.

- que:
  - Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
  ans:
  - Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.

- que:
  - Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
  ans:
  - She has never mentioned her family.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I was looking for you.

- que:
  - Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
  ans:
  - You are fortunate in your father.

- que:
  - I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
  ans:
  - Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.

- que:
  - You have forgotten my last name?
  ans:
  - I have forgotten it, dear.

- que:
  - I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
  ans:
  - Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?

- que:
  - Whet do you mean?
  ans:
  - Miss Wollsten!

- que:
  - Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
  ans:
  - He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.

- que:
  - You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
  ans:
  - I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..

- que:
  - Her name is Thea?
  ans:
  - Theodosia.

- que:
  - You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
  ans:
  - Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.

- que:
  - Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
  ans:
  - What is her illness?

- que:
  - Do you mind if I go with you?
  ans:
  - There is something evil about her.

- que:
  - Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
  ans:
  - The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.

- que:
  - Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
  ans:
  - In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.

- que:
  - I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
  ans:
  - You are my friend.

- que:
  - She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
  ans:
  - And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?

- que:
  - Everything's so simple. I like you.
  ans:
  - You're crying. Why?

- que:
  - What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
  ans:
  - The General threatened me.

- que:
  - Why in the world can't you?
  ans:
  - He hates all my race.

- que:
  - Are you running a business or a charity ward?
  ans:
  - Well, all right ...

- que:
  - How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
  ans:
  - Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.

- que:
  - Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
  ans:
  - All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.

- que:
  - Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
  ans:
  - I hate to do this, fella.

- que:
  - Don't ... George?
  ans:
  - What did ...

- que:
  - Go through with what?
  ans:
  - Suicide.

- que:
  - What are you, a mind reader or something?
  ans:
  - Oh, no.

- que:
  - Well, who are you, then?
  ans:
  - Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

- que:
  - Odbody ... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
  ans:
  - Angel, Second Class.

- que:
  - Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
  ans:
  - I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.

- que:
  - Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
  ans:
  - By letting me help you.

- que:
  - Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - I said I wish I'd never been born.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Made what?
  ans:
  - Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.

- que:
  - Why? Don't they believe in angels?
  ans:
  - You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the ...

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What ... are you a hypnotist?
  ans:
  - No, of course not.

- que:
  - Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
  ans:
  - Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.

- que:
  - Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
  ans:
  - You're nobody. You have no identity.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Zuzu's petals.

- que:
  - You know where he lives?
  ans:
  - Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.

- que:
  - Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
  ans:
  - Clarence ...

- que:
  - Where's Mary?
  ans:
  - Oh, well, I can't ...

- que:
  - I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?
  ans:
  - I ...

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Poor George ... Sit down.

- que:
  - If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
  ans:
  - Well, naturally. Of course.

- que:
  - Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
  ans:
  - Where? I don't see a thing.

- que:
  - Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
  ans:
  - That's your problem, George Bailey.

- que:
  - A boy?
  ans:
  - That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.

- que:
  - What did you stop it for?
  ans:
  - I want you to take a good look at that face.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - George Bailey.

- que:
  - It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
  ans:
  - Not a soul.

- que:
  - Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
  ans:
  - Well, wait and see.

- que:
  - Yes, but what happened to George?
  ans:
  - Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

- que:
  - You sent for me, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.

- que:
  - Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
  ans:
  - You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.

- que:
  - What's that book you've got there?
  ans:
  - The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

- que:
  - The Building and what?
  ans:
  - The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.

- que:
  - Is this the place?
  ans:
  - Of course it's the place.

- que:
  - Hello, Joseph, trouble?
  ans:
  - Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.

- que:
  - George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
  ans:
  - That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Mother ...

- que:
  - Mother? What do you want?
  ans:
  - Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.

- que:
  - When'd you see him last?
  ans:
  - Today, over at the house.

- que:
  - Well, what happened to you?
  ans:
  - I won a flower.

- que:
  - Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - Want to give my flower a drink.

- que:
  - Will you try to get some sleep?
  ans:
  - I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.

- que:
  - It will?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
  ans:
  - Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

- que:
  - Old college graduate now, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.

- que:
  - Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
  ans:
  - No charge.

- que:
  - What boat you sailing on?
  ans:
  - I'm working across on a cattle boat.

- que:
  - What's that?

  - The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.

- que:
  - Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
  ans:
  - Sure  Sam Wainwright.

- que:
  - Hmmm?
  ans:
  - Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.

- que:
  - Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well then, how do you know?
  ans:
  - Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.

- que:
  - Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button ... trying to get rid of me, huh?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Mr. Gower, do you want something ... Anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Anything I can do back here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
  ans:
  - Ummmm ...

- que:
  - Is it a charge, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes  charge.

- que:
  - Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
  ans:
  - No. No.

- que:
  - I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
  ans:
  - You want a martini?

- que:
  - Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
  ans:
  - Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.

- que:
  - You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
  ans:
  - Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.

- que:
  - Got a match?
  ans:
  - Very funny. Very funny.

- que:
  - What do you mean, and be bored to death?
  ans:
  - Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.

- que:
  - Did you get a doctor?
  ans:
  - Oh, am I glad to see you.

- que:
  - Say, where's Mother?
  ans:
  - She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.

- que:
  - Hello, George, how are you?
  ans:
  - Harry ... Harry ...

- que:
  - Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, yeah.

  ans:
  - She was here first.

- que:
  - Hello, what am I bid?
  ans:
  - Hello, Georgie-Porgie.

- que:
  - What gives?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.

- que:
  - George, can I see you for a second?
  ans:
  - Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.

- que:
  - Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?

- que:
  - What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
  ans:
  - George ...

- que:
  - Why didn't you call me?
  ans:
  - I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.

- que:
  - All right now, what happened? How did it start?
  ans:
  - How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.

- que:
  - All of it?
  ans:
  - Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.

- que:
  - And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
  ans:
  - Yeah . . yeah ... maybe ... maybe ...

- que:
  - Well, what about the Building and Loan?
  ans:
  - Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.

- que:
  - Have you notified the police?
  ans:
  - No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow ...

- que:
  - Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
  ans:
  - I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.

- que:
  - Well, what about all your other friends?
  ans:
  - They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.

- que:
  - Yes ... how much is your equity in it?
  ans:
  - Five hundred dollars.

- que:
  - Made up your mind yet?
  ans:

  - I don't like coconuts.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Okay  what can we lose?
  ans:
  - Hot dog! Just like an organ.

- que:
  - I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
  ans:
  - Eighteen.

- que:
  - Too young or too old?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.

- que:
  - In that place?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - What'd you wish, George?
  ans:
  - Oh, no.

- que:
  - Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
  ans:
  - I'll take it. And then what?

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.

- que:
  - Didn't you tell her?
  ans:
  - I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by ...

- que:
  - Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
  ans:
  - Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.

- que:
  - When did you get back?
  ans:
  - Tuesday.

- que:
  - Do you like it?
  ans:
  - It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.

- que:
  - Would you rather leave?
  ans:
  - No, I don't want to be rude.

- que:
  - Don't you like her?
  ans:
  - Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.

- que:
  - Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
  ans:
  - That does it  come here.

- que:
  - Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
  ans:
  - To keep from being an old maid.

- que:
  - You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you ... ... Your what?
  ans:
  - My baby.

- que:
  - Is it snowing?
  ans:
  - Yeah, just started.

- que:
  - Where's your coat and hat?
  ans:
  - Left them at the office.

- que:
  - What is it, a sore throat or what?
  ans:
  - Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.

- que:
  - The doctor? Was the doctor here?
  ans:
  - Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.

- que:
  - Is she running a temperature? What is it?
  ans:
  - Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.

- que:
  - Where're you going?
  ans:
  - Oh, George, George, George.

- que:
  - What plates?
  ans:
  - Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.

- que:
  - Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
  ans:
  - I guess you forgot something.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - You forgot something.

- que:
  - Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
  ans:
  - Sure, sure I am.

- que:
  - How about that one there?
  ans:
  - Hmm? Well, I ...

- que:
  - How fast does this go?
  ans:
  - With the right wind, 15-20 knots.

- que:
  - You going to the lighthouse?
  ans:
  - Come on, you guys.

- que:
  - For me...?
  ans:
  - What the hell. For you....

- que:
  - When do we get to the lighthouse?
  ans:
  - Soon, dark eyes, soon.

- que:
  - Someone pop your balloon?
  ans:
  - No problem, no problem.

- que:
  - What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables?
  ans:
  - I can't help it it sticks in my mind.

- que:
  - Is she responsible for the punch?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I could give you a dozen good reasons.

- que:
  - What the hell. Did your mom put all this together?
  ans:
  - Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.

- que:
  - Shells and lobsters and stuff?
  ans:
  - Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson.

- que:
  - The lighthouse?
  ans:
  - No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - We're hung up on something.

- que:
  - Where're we going?
  ans:
  - Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.

- que:
  - Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
  ans:
  - Listen to Andy, Sean.

- que:
  - You coming up on him?
  ans:
  - You bet. Hang on....

- que:
  - We're hung up here. Snagged.
  ans:
  - How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?

- que:
  - Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?
  ans:
  - Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty.

- que:
  - On your own time?
  ans:
  - Happy to do it.

- que:
  - I just made it up. It means, \"Get me out of there.\" What the hell's that?
  ans:
  - Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.

- que:
  - Chief?
  ans:
  - In here.

- que:
  - Positive I.D.?
  ans:
  - The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.

- que:
  - That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it?
  ans:
  - Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....

- que:
  - The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
  ans:
  - Nine-thirty, ten maybe.

- que:
  - Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.

- que:
  - How long ago?
  ans:
  - About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight....

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - No place special. Just hanging out.

- que:
  - Sailing?
  ans:
  - I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.

- que:
  - What else is there to do?
  ans:
  - You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.

- que:
  - Do I have to?
  ans:
  - You'll have to make up your own mind about that.

- que:
  - What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?
  ans:
  - Bartending? I'm 17.

- que:
  - Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
  ans:
  - Because.

- que:
  - Is Hooper coming to dinner?
  ans:
  - Not till next year.

- que:
  - You want to come here a minute?
  ans:
  - I got something for you to do tomorrow.

- que:
  - Mike? Is that you?
  ans:
  - Pop. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - It's okay. What happened?
  ans:
  - I passed out, but I'm okay.

- que:
  - Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others?
  ans:
  - Sean's still out there.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Dad, I'm sorry....

- que:
  - Did you get any pictures?
  ans:
  - Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did....

- que:
  - Let's see -- you got a minute?
  ans:
  - Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

- que:
  - May I have this dance?
  ans:
  - Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear.

- que:
  - Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
  ans:
  - Temporarily? Uh...sure....

- que:
  - Is that what it is?
  ans:
  - You're damn right that's what it is.

- que:
  - Come on, let's check the bite radius.
  ans:
  - What's that supposed to mean?

- que:
  - The whale's mouth?
  ans:
  - The Shark's mouth.

- que:
  - You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
  ans:
  - Could be a shark. But maybe not.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan....

- que:
  - What makes you think there might be?
  ans:
  - Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....

- que:
  - Sound?
  ans:
  - Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.

- que:
  - Can't you tell?
  ans:
  - Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....

- que:
  - Where the hell were you?
  ans:
  - Late.

- que:
  - Do I have to talk to those two?
  ans:
  - My boss and your boss. Sure.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because they're playing our song.

- que:
  - Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
  ans:
  - And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.

- que:
  - Fooling around?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Mrs. Silvera?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Silvera.

- que:
  - Need a ride?
  ans:
  - As far as the office.

- que:
  - You have to smoke so early in the morning?
  ans:
  - It's good with coffee.

- que:
  - Where's my day book?
  ans:
  - In the den.

- que:
  - Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
  ans:
  - It's an island. Got to run.

- que:
  - For me?
  ans:
  - Damn.

- que:
  - Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
  ans:
  - Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.

- que:
  - Oh. Want to talk about it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - All summer?
  ans:
  - He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - It was bad, wasn't it.

- que:
  - That's great too. Gorgeous.
  ans:
  - Are you going to be able to sleep?

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all.

- que:
  - What'd I say?
  ans:
  - That you were fired.

- que:
  - Because of today? The beach?
  ans:
  - Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!

- que:
  - What're you going to do today?
  ans:
  - Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - Going out.

- que:
  - What is it? What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Mike's out there.

- que:
  - Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you?
  ans:
  - I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....

- que:
  - I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
  ans:
  - Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

- que:
  - Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne?
  ans:
  - 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.

- que:
  - That's it. Just do it, all right?
  ans:
  - 10-4, soon as I can raise him.

- que:
  - Harbor Air, do you read? Over?
  ans:
  - Brody? This is Patrol Base.

- que:
  - Where the hell is Air One?
  ans:
  - That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.

- que:
  - Did he raise the Kids?
  ans:
  - Last transmission said ten juve- niles.

- que:
  - Yeah? Then what?
  ans:
  - Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.

- que:
  - Did you say Cable Junction?
  ans:
  - That's what he said.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - 1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out.

- que:
  - No. Find your brother, okay?
  ans:
  - Some people.

- que:
  - You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
  ans:
  - Hi Dad.

- que:
  - Is that me?
  ans:
  - That's you.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Tide doesn't turn for three hours.

- que:
  - How old is your cousin?
  ans:
  - Seventeen. She's a senior.

- que:
  - You're not going out right away, are you?
  ans:
  - Waiting for Andy.

- que:
  - Mike! Are you going out?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Did you ever see a dolphin?
  ans:
  - Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.

- que:
  - Okay, okay, coming....
  ans:
  - Terry! You okay?

- que:
  - Get a dance yet?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Who'd you ask?
  ans:
  - Tina Wilcox.

- que:
  - Anyone know what time it is?
  ans:
  - 3,30.

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - Sideways - For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....

- que:
  - Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie?
  ans:
  - Next week.

- que:
  - You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
  ans:
  - Just like this.

- que:
  - What about sailing?
  ans:
  - The tide's running. It'll take us to the light.

- que:
  - What about the others?
  ans:
  - They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.

- que:
  - What're we going to do in the mean time?
  ans:
  - I dunno. We'll think of something.

- que:
  - And second?
  ans:
  - Mmmmmm.

- que:
  - What Kids? Who went out?
  ans:
  - All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.

- que:
  - Mike? Our Mike?
  ans:
  - Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.

- que:
  - What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going?
  ans:
  - Be careful....

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.

- que:
  - Figure they split?
  ans:
  - Happens every season -- someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.

- que:
  - How much longer?
  ans:
  - Until we find something.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Power line.

- que:
  - What's the lighthouse?
  ans:
  - It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know....

- que:
  - Is there something I don't know about?
  ans:
  - We'll be over by the lighthouse.

- que:
  - You do everything your parents tell you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....

- que:
  - Heading back?
  ans:
  - Might as well.

- que:
  - When are we going out? You and me?
  ans:
  - Not tonight.

- que:
  - You going with Patrick?
  ans:
  - Who wouldn't.

- que:
  - Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
  ans:
  - They're turning around.

- que:
  - Do I have to play with the little kids?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Go on, beat it.

- que:
  - I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Would you take him?
  ans:
  - And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.

- que:
  - Len, can I see you a minute?
  ans:
  - I think we got a couple of live ones.

- que:
  - How the hell do we get him down. from there?
  ans:
  - Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.

- que:
  - Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
  ans:
  - What the hell is he doing?

- que:
  - So? So?
  ans:
  - So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.

- que:
  - Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
  ans:
  - I'm only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted.

- que:
  - What's your plan, Brody?
  ans:
  - Sure am.

- que:
  - You see the three-quarter socket?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Down there.

- que:
  - Aren't you suiting up, mate?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How many sharks have you killed?
  ans:
  - Me? I don't know. Twenty, thirty. I love them, think they're the greatest.

- que:
  - Want another one?
  ans:
  - Well, not much longer to go.

- que:
  - What is it, 97 days?
  ans:
  - Till this opens, not our wedding.

- que:
  - You called, Doctor?
  ans:
  - Everything's going wrong. I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before. I can't get him to respond.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I can't understand it. Something's bothering them.

- que:
  - And what else is bothering you?
  ans:
  - ... Hutton. He really pisses me off.

- que:
  - Sure. Want to try that new Italian place?
  ans:
  - We play hide and seek all the time. They find a lot of things.

- que:
  - Where's the rubber band?
  ans:
  - Look, Michael... you don't have to come.

- que:
  - What do I do now?
  ans:
  - Take a deep breath and hold it.

- que:
  - Honey... you all right?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you scared?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
  ans:
  - ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.

- que:
  - You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean?
  ans:
  - That we swim.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Up.

- que:
  - And leave me down here?
  ans:
  - Make up your mind.

- que:
  - I talked you into this?
  ans:
  - I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.

- que:
  - No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming! You'd think you're gonna leave me?
  ans:
  - You would, wouldn't you? I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.

- que:
  - I think so. I'm not sure... Are you?
  ans:
  - I'm okay.

- que:
  - God, they're horrible. I hate them. Did you see its eyes? How black they are? The look in them?
  ans:
  - Don't think about it. It's over.

- que:
  - You're going down there again?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - After what happened to us?
  ans:
  - I know I can capture it.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah. Really nice. Who's your designer? Sassoon Shark?
  ans:
  - I got it on sale. A real steel.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Bracelets.

- que:
  - Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
  ans:
  - It's easier to lure sharks at night.

- que:
  - Change your mind?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You want me to stay?
  ans:
  - Get some sleep. And tell Sean I'm sorry.

- que:
  - How's your patient?
  ans:
  - Recovering nicely.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I need more pressure in the shark tank.

- que:
  - I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow. Would you do that for me?
  ans:
  - Sure. Let's go.

- que:
  - ... Mean through the tubes?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's faster.

- que:
  - Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way. You're not going to walk all the way around?
  ans:
  - I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.

- que:
  - Honey, what is it?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
  ans:
  - That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.

- que:
  - Who's going to do it?
  ans:
  - Me.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Go where?
  ans:
  - On the telly. We're to film him for the evening news.

- que:
  - I just did. Can you make them do tricks?
  ans:
  - They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns.

- que:
  - Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
  ans:
  - Wait a minute. These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton. They're dolphins.

- que:
  - What in hell is that?
  ans:
  - Because I don't trust you, that's why.

- que:
  - How's sleeping beauty?
  ans:
  - Still sleeping.

- que:
  - Why are you?
  ans:
  - I like it when they wake up.

- que:
  - Is there such a place? A cave or something with such a flow?
  ans:
  - I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...

- que:
  - When did this happen?
  ans:
  - Ten minutes ago.

- que:
  - Give me a ride?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Musclehead?
  ans:
  - He's missing.

- que:
  - Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while? Show him around for me?
  ans:
  - Sure. No problem.

- que:
  - Sean. Sean, where are you?
  ans:
  - Someone's looking for you.

- que:
  - How you doing, Kelly?
  ans:
  - I'm Neo-Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold.

- que:
  - So, you just get here?
  ans:
  - Yeah, from Boston.

- que:
  - How long you staying?
  ans:
  - I don't know, it depends.

- que:
  - You like Florida?
  ans:
  - I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.

  - You gonna work at The Kingdom?
  ans:
  - Depends on big brother.

  - As always.

- que:
  - Herpes?
  ans:
  - Why you sonuvabitch...

- que:
  - Sean, do you have herpes?
  ans:
  - No. Of course not. Don't listen to him. He's - he's... ... my brother.

- que:
  - Not for me. I don't go in the water, remember?
  ans:
  - You're not in the water. You're in a gondola.

- que:
  - Told you you'd like it.
  ans:
  - I'm not acting! I don't want to go in it, okay?

- que:
  - Now what's this do?
  ans:
  - Goes up.

- que:
  - What're you doing later?
  ans:
  - Taking my boyfriend to the airport.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Gotta sneeze.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - On monitor three. Was a glimpse of something.

- que:
  - That?
  ans:
  - Yes, there is goes.

- que:
  - Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
  ans:
  - Make sure you put this back.

- que:
  - Aww, can't I keep it?
  ans:
  - You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.

- que:
  - Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it? Why don't you throw in another shark?
  ans:
  - Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.

- que:
  - So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
  ans:
  - No, South Georgia.

- que:
  - What the hell's there?
  ans:
  - Polar bears.

- que:
  - Polar bears in Georgia?

  ans:
  - It's large enough...

- que:
  - How far away is filter number four?
  ans:
  - Five hundred yards.

- que:
  - After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
  ans:
  - You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.

- que:
  - What kind of trouble?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something.

- que:
  - Sharks?
  ans:
  - In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you.

  ans:
  - Great. I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.

  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Nowhere....

- que:
  - How come it's my responsibility?
  ans:
  - Because....

- que:
  - We don't have anything straightened out. You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
  ans:
  - Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....

- que:
  - What the hell are we arguing about?
  ans:
  - I don't know...You...I don't know.

- que:
  - What's wrong? What happened?
  ans:
  - Thea was attacked by a shark....

- que:
  - You knew...?
  ans:
  - It went away....

  ans:
  - How could you do that? Your own daughter....

- que:
  - Where's my mother?
  ans:
  - I don't know....

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you tell us?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. Please, Carla. I didn't think there was any danger. I'm sorry. I love you. Both of you.

- que:
  - Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...? About spending so much time working in the water?
  ans:
  - Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....

- que:
  - You want to try your hand at something...?
  ans:
  - I'd be afraid of losing....

- que:
  - Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
  ans:
  - All he did was kiss me....

- que:
  - Beginning of what?
  ans:
  - Whatever happens next.....

- que:
  - We will...We'll have a lot of time together. What are you going to do now?
  ans:
  - We'll be there....

- que:
  - Michael! This thing working?
  ans:
  - You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....

- que:
  - What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
  ans:
  - What difference does it make? It's here....

- que:
  - Stop what?
  ans:
  - That....

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Adds flavor....

  - Can I ride one sometime...?
  ans:
  - It's too dangerous....

- que:

  ans:
  - Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.

  ans:
  - To throw out of the window.

- que:
  - It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
  ans:
  - I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.

- que:
  - How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over \"Jennifer\" for months?
  ans:
  - Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.

  ans:
  - Car accident.

- que:
  - I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?

- que:
  - You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
  ans:
  - Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my \"Nervous Tick\" ...

- que:
  - Don't give me that! Not another told me ..
  ans:
  - You don't really believe this?

- que:
  - I dunno what I can do to help you?
  ans:
  - I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..

- que:
  - What about Citrine?
  ans:
  - Screw Citrine. He can fire me.

- que:
  - Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
  ans:
  - That's just what I wanna find out.

- que:
  - Jesus. What are you doin?

  - We're not here. I don't want the desk to hear us ..

- que:
  - Why did he ask if it was frozen?
  ans:
  - That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..

- que:
  - How do you know her hair's black?
  ans:
  - Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.

- que:
  - Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think \"Jennifer,\" and this lady got hit by the same guy?
  ans:
  - I don't see that at all ..

- que:
  - Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
  ans:
  - Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.

- que:
  - I thought it was Taylor's case?
  ans:
  - Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do, Chief?
  ans:

  ans:

- que:
  - Did he get you the job?
  ans:

- que:
  - Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
  ans:
  - No .. But we have a theory ..

  - Maybe he's lying to you?
  ans:

  - Said who? Sugar?
  ans:
  - Hey, I'm learning as I go.

- que:
  - Exactly. And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look! And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water. Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
  ans:
  - Mmm. Hmm.

- que:
  - It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And it might have even worked too.

- que:
  - You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there? Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
  ans:
  - I gotta get back to Cushman.

- que:
  - You love me now, don't you?
  ans:
  - Very much.

- que:
  - -- the kwan.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - That's your word?
  ans:
  - Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan.

- que:
  - Great word. Towel?
  ans:
  - Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.

- que:
  - What do you know about dating a single mother?
  ans:
  - Oh I know plenty. I was raised by a single mother.

- que:
  - You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
  ans:
  - No, I don't know.

- que:
  - You never had The Talk, did you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Hey, that's my word, okay?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.

- que:
  - I'm trying to talk to you. How's your marriage?
  ans:
  - Not everyone has what you have.

- que:
  - Thanks for coming.
  ans:
  - We still having dinner in L.A.?

- que:
  - I missed ya. What can I say?
  ans:
  - I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.

- que:
  - Jerry. You two will be together forever.
  ans:
  - To the pools?

- que:
  - How can I make your life better?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry what I said back there.

- que:
  - Cronin's okay for lunch?
  ans:
  - Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.

- que:
  - I'm fine. What's up?
  ans:
  - I came here to let you go. _ 27.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - Dick.

- que:
  - Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
  ans:
  - Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.

- que:
  - What's going on, Jerry?
  ans:
  - A lot. We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.

- que:
  - I'm scared. What is it?
  ans:
  - It's in a cage. Do not be scared of...

- que:
  - What'd I say?
  ans:
  - He should have kept his head tucked down.

- que:
  - After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
  ans:
  - This is how you play God.

- que:
  - Do you think it goes all the way across?
  ans:
  - One way to find out.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - We can't just...

- que:
  - How much weight have you lost?
  ans:
  - Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.

- que:
  - Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
  ans:
  - Because \"Dr. Grant\" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
  ans:
  - Eric! Are you here?

- que:
  - Well what?
  ans:
  - This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.

- que:
  - Think.
  ans:
  - When did you have it last?

- que:
  - What?...WHAT!?
  ans:
  - I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...

- que:
  - Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
  ans:
  - Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

- que:
  - We should try fishing again.
  ans:
  - Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

- que:
  - You mean it?
  ans:
  - I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.

- que:
  - How low?
  ans:
  - He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

- que:
  - What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
  ans:
  - Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.

- que:
  - Where's Dad?
  ans:
  - Just hold on.

- que:
  - Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
  ans:
  - That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.

- que:
  - So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
  ans:
  - Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

- que:
  - He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island. Right?
  ans:
  - We'll be broke in four weeks.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.

- que:
  - Is it a rex?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - How would you classify it?
  ans:
  - Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout.

- que:
  - Baryonyx?
  ans:
  - Not with that sail. Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

- que:
  - That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
  ans:
  - He used to know me.

- que:
  - Anything good?
  ans:
  - Raptors, mostly.

- que:
  - You remember the sounds they made?
  ans:
  - I try not to.

- que:
  - You think they could talk to each other?
  ans:
  - To a degree we never imagined.

- que:
  - In Costa Rica?
  ans:
  - On the island.

- que:
  - Which one do you prefer?
  ans:
  - The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.

- que:
  - Any weapons, radios?
  ans:
  - Found this, but the battery's dead.

- que:
  - Did you read Malcolm's book?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What did you think?
  ans:
  - I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.

- que:
  - Know what this is?
  ans:
  - A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

- que:
  - How much of this island have you explored?
  ans:
  - I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.

- que:
  - Do you have any kids?
  ans:
  - No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

- que:
  - The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
  ans:
  - She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.

- que:
  - Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
  ans:
  - No. I couldn't see.

- que:
  - What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
  ans:
  - The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.

- que:
  - What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
  ans:
  - Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...

- que:
  - There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
  ans:
  - Well that's good.

- que:
  - Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch. You go.

- que:
  - Sorry. We were saying?
  ans:
  - It matches the pictures.

- que:
  - You hear something?
  ans:
  - No. I feel something.

- que:
  - Any damage?
  ans:
  - Minimal.

- que:
  - You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter what I think.

- que:
  - Is there an antidote?
  ans:
  - Like if you shoot yourself in the foot? Wouldn't matter. You'd be dead before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I don't believe you.

- que:
  - Are you out of your mind? I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
  ans:
  - It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - John ...

- que:
  - Hi, Dad.
  ans:
  - InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?

- que:
  - Kelly! What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I don't even know this woman.

- que:
  - Stop saying fantastic. Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.

- que:
  - Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
  ans:
  - No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a while.

- que:
  - You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?
  ans:
  - That was about a year ago.

- que:
  - Well, is he?
  ans:
  - No. Richard talked to his parents.

- que:
  - How could you possibly?
  ans:
  - Because you said so. Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.

- que:
  - Where does it say that?
  ans:
  - On the side of that one truck.

- que:
  - What are you guys gonna do?
  ans:
  - Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.

- que:
  - Cancel that, Dieter.
  ans:
  - Are you all right?! Anything broken?

- que:
  - Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
  ans:
  - You heard his, Dieter. Find a new spot. And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.

- que:
  - How close do you have to be?
  ans:
  - Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.

- que:
  - You rally think this'll draw the parent?
  ans:
  - The velociraptors.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Piss.

- que:
  - Where's the power and radio setup?
  ans:
  - Operations building. Far end of the street.

- que:
  - Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
  ans:
  - Possible.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's... behind... us.

- que:
  - So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
  ans:
  - You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children.

- que:
  - What's he got in there?
  ans:
  - Piss.

- que:
  - Their what?
  ans:
  - Oh, God.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch.

- que:
  - You're going too?
  ans:
  - I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.

- que:
  - Do you see any family resemblance here?
  ans:
  - You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.

- que:
  - Our chance to do what?
  ans:
  - There' no reason for name calling.

- que:
  - Lava?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Feeling a bit blue, are we?
  ans:
  - Just -- flawed. Very deeply flawed.

- que:
  - Why should they?
  ans:
  - Because it exists.

- que:
  - It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
  ans:
  - Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth.

- que:
  - Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must take him down.
  ans:
  - So the truth is more important to you than your life?

- que:
  - How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
  ans:
  - Four, counting the one in the chamber.

- que:
  - You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
  ans:
  - You're going home. I'm sending a radio call for the boats. We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.

- que:
  - Funded by whom?
  ans:
  - John Hammond.

- que:
  - Can you set up?
  ans:
  - Oh, God.

- que:
  - So what's your story, Nick?
  ans:
  - I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

- que:
  - That must be interesting. What drew you there?
  ans:
  - Women. 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.

- que:
  - Very noble of you. You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
  ans:
  - Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.

- que:
  - Oh, please. How am I supposed to keep a straight face when -- -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
  ans:
  - Ian's a very good friend of mine.

- que:
  - That little black line?
  ans:
  - Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.

- que:
  - Can the kid walk?
  ans:
  - You've got to be kidding.

- que:
  - You're sure we have to?
  ans:
  - It's not worth taking the chance, John.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The door security systems are shutting down.

- que:
  - Phones are out too.
  ans:
  - Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?

- que:
  - I will not do it. You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
  ans:
  - Where did the vehicles stop?

- que:
  - How many lines of code are there?
  ans:
  - Uh - - about two million.

- que:
  - How would we cut off the lysine?
  ans:
  - No trick to it. Just stop running the program. Leaving them unattended.

- que:
  - How long will this take?
  ans:
  - Bout thirty seconds.

- que:
  - Dodgson, Dodgson. We got Dodgson here! See, nobody cares. Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'll get 'em all.

- que:
  - What? No menthol?
  ans:
  - Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry. The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.

- que:
  - Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
  ans:
  - Yours was fully illustrated, honey.

- que:
  - Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike. Is that okay?
  ans:
  - Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing. Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.

- que:
  - Six weeks?
  ans:
  - Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Pretty sure.

- que:
  - I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
  ans:
  - I have samples all over the kitchen.

- que:
  - Could I have a tissue please?
  ans:
  - Fascinating animals, fascinating.

- que:
  - They'll all be fine. Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
  ans:
  - John....

- que:
  - Good! Keep going, now. The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - They died together?
  ans:
  - The taphonomy sure looks that way.

- que:
  - You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
  ans:
  - Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments. Velociraptor?

- que:
  - Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing. What's so wrong with kids?
  ans:
  - Oh, Ellie, look. They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - The Cretaceous.

- que:
  - Okay, who's the jerk?
  ans:
  - Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....

- que:
  - And what are those?
  ans:
  - Small versions of adults, honey.

- que:
  - So what are you thinking?
  ans:
  - We're out of a job.

- que:
  - And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too. That's what makes her sick. Good work Tim.
  ans:
  - Wait a minute! How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - I'll just finish. Yeah, I want to finish.

- que:
  - It's just the two raptors, right? You're sure the third one's contained?
  ans:
  - Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.

- que:
  - The fences are electrified, right?
  ans:
  - I can't wait anymore. Something went wrong. I'm going to go get the power back on.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Unpredictability....

- que:
  - Dino droppings?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Can we chance moving him?
  ans:
  - Please - - chance it.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - He sends his apologies.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because he's like me. He's a digger.

- que:
  - What are we looking for?
  ans:
  - In a box under my seat.

- que:
  - Are they heavy?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
  ans:
  - No, we don't have any animatronics here. These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

- que:
  - I've never been a rich man. I hear it's nice. Is it nice?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
  ans:
  - Hey! Where are the brakes?

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - These look kind of familiar.

- que:
  - That's okay. Listen, give me your hand.
  ans:
  - Are you okay? Can you move? Tim! Are you okay?

- que:
  - Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
  ans:
  - Yes it is.

- que:
  - It's just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What if the car falls? What if the wheels fall?
  ans:
  - You got me.

- que:
  - It's so strong! Look at its nose. Need help?
  ans:
  - Come on, try some. Take a bite.

- que:
  - It's a bit of a climb. You guys think you can make it?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - You have no idea.
  ans:
  - So you two dig up dinosaurs?

- que:
  - You got any kids?
  ans:
  - Me? Oh, hell yes. Three. I love 'em. I love kids. Anything at all can and does happen.

- que:
  - You're married?
  ans:
  - Occasionally. Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.

- que:
  - Machines hate you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they hate me.

- que:
  - You want to talk about this?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well, I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?
  ans:
  - Kids get scared.

- que:
  - Where does he think he's going?
  ans:
  - When you gotta go, you gotta go.

- que:
  - For today, I guarantee it.
  ans:
  - What? What can we do?

- que:
  - And who in God's name do you think you are....?
  ans:
  - John Hammond. And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.

- que:
  - Well, I'm afraid I do. There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe. He represents my investors. He says they insist on outside opinions.
  ans:
  - Not just kids - - for everyone. We're going to open next year. Unless the lawyers kill me first. I don't care for lawyers. You?

- que:
  - What kind of opinions?
  ans:
  - No, I'm sorry, that wouldn't be possible. We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -

- que:
  - That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
  ans:
  - The brachiosaur? Thirty.

- que:
  - Wu?
  ans:
  - Robert. Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya. Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.

- que:
  - What does he mean by \"target audience\"?
  ans:
  - It's safe.

- que:
  - Go that's the way we're going to go. What do you say?
  ans:
  - Alright.

- que:
  - Hear that? Are you hearing this?
  ans:
  - I guess we'll just have to evolve too.

- que:
  - What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
  ans:
  - I'll stay awake.

- que:
  - All night?
  ans:
  - All night.

- que:
  - I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor. Will you look after Tim, Lex?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
  ans:
  - Your silence intrigues me.

- que:
  - I think perhaps I'll just sit down. I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
  ans:
  - That will teach you to trust Grandpa.

- que:
  - Why didn't I build in Orlando?
  ans:
  - I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - What if we fall? I hate trees.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.

- que:
  - Really? How much?
  ans:
  - Fifty.

- que:
  - You want to put in chain saws?
  ans:
  - No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.

- que:
  - Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
  ans:
  - No, but...

- que:
  - And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
  ans:
  - That's not true...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I think we're lost.

- que:
  - Who is this? What's going on?
  ans:
  - This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.

- que:
  - Where's Ken? Is he all right?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
  ans:
  - He... he's here...

- que:
  - Who's there?
  ans:
  - Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...

- que:
  - Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
  ans:
  - Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - It's still on.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - His camera... it's still recording.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - _Krueger_...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Come on.

- que:
  - Three. Where's my client?
  ans:
  - Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.

- que:
  - What are the charges?
  ans:
  - I thought that was Ted Bundy.

- que:
  - A house?
  ans:
  - That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.

- que:
  - Who's chest?
  ans:
  - Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...

- que:
  - Are you going to plead insanity?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
  ans:
  - Because everyone knows he's guilty...

- que:
  - You think that's going to work?
  ans:
  - I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.

- que:
  - You watch this garbage?
  ans:
  - This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - He's fucking nuts.

- que:
  - Doesnit sleep?
  ans:
  - Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation. Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.

- que:
  - He wets the bed?
  ans:
  - I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.

- que:
  - This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
  ans:
  - No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy... And I'm a bed-wetter.

- que:
  - So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
  ans:
  - My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.

- que:
  - That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
  ans:
  - Insomnolesence...

- que:
  - So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
  ans:
  - Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...

- que:
  - How do we prove it?
  ans:
  - Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.

- que:
  - How long will he need to be asleep?
  ans:
  - We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.

- que:
  - Cute waitresses?
  ans:
  - That's open to debate.

- que:
  - Well, I'm onto something more useful. You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
  ans:
  - Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.

- que:
  - Yeah, what is it?
  ans:
  - _It's a second REM pattern_.

- que:
  - So what do we do?
  ans:
  - I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...

- que:
  - Great. When can you do it?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.

- que:
  - You're not going to be there?
  ans:
  - I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow. They're... digging up some new evidence.

- que:
  - You saw him?
  ans:
  - A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.

- que:
  - How's that possible?
  ans:
  - I don't know... but I think he's pissed.

- que:
  - You know how to use one of those?
  ans:
  - I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.

- que:
  - Think it'll do any good?
  ans:
  - Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.

- que:
  - And if he's not?
  ans:
  - Then we're all in a lot of trouble.

- que:
  - So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
  ans:
  - Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.

- que:
  - How long will the effect last?
  ans:
  - About ten minutes.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...

- que:
  - What happened? Where's Jason?
  ans:
  - My client... is dead. But I think he's a free man.

- que:
  - You work in the insurance department?
  ans:
  - You have been hearing the sordid side then.

- que:
  - Where do you live?
  ans:
  - Up there.

- que:
  - What is it really?
  ans:
  - Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.

- que:
  - Have you worked here long?
  ans:
  - No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.

- que:
  - Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
  ans:
  - You could say we represent the unofficial view of a well-ordered society.

- que:
  - -- Ah, but what if it wasn't?
  ans:
  - -- Small.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man. Very good.

- que:
  - These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
  ans:
  - Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.

- que:
  - Success or nothing?
  ans:
  - No -- not even success. My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living. Not for other people, it's for me.

- que:
  - What made you think I'd be able to get you into the Castle?
  ans:
  - In a manner of speaking.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - An empty tomb?

- que:
  - Another one?
  ans:
  - If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them. All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.

- que:
  - Did you see him?
  ans:
  - I've never seen him. I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.

- que:
  - He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
  ans:
  - In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.

- que:
  - Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Good morning -- Or should I say good afternoon?
  ans:
  - Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.

- que:
  - ... My ... social situation?
  ans:
  - I usually take lunch by the River.

- que:
  - Was there something else?
  ans:
  - No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation. He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.

- que:
  - I've never seen you here before.
  ans:
  - Why would you suppose so?

- que:
  - Have you looked?
  ans:
  - Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.

- que:
  - I was having an affair with Eduard. He didn't tell you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That he was -- satisfied in that regard. I didn't want to pry.

- que:
  - What's funny?
  ans:
  - This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.

- que:
  - The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
  ans:
  - Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here? This will always be the ghetto.

- que:
  - There are some people I'd like you to meet. Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
  ans:
  - ... All right.

- que:
  - You almost married recently, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Last year. I -- it was broken off.

- que:
  - And you ...?
  ans:
  - I'm suspicious of men who want to marry. I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.

- que:
  - What of it?
  ans:
  - And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.

- que:
  - My only concern is the human tribunal. Isn't it yours?
  ans:
  - Yes -- which is why \"quiet, dependable people\" have to take charge of their own lives.

- que:
  - Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
  ans:
  - Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.

- que:
  - Why were you given notice?
  ans:
  - They're not obliged to tell.

- que:
  - How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
  ans:
  - I've heard of it happening.

- que:
  - And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Usually.

- que:
  - Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
  ans:
  - Gabriela! -- you did get away.

- que:
  - Gabriela ...?
  ans:
  - Only two steps back? Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.

- que:
  - When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
  ans:
  - Wednesday. We left the office together.

- que:
  - Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
  ans:
  - No, we said goodbye outside the building. He went off, as usual, toward his house.

- que:
  - Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
  ans:
  - Yes. Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends. How was Eduard ...

- que:
  - He was found in the River. Could he swim?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
  ans:
  - No, I suppose not.

- que:
  - Can I ask -- how you found me?
  ans:
  - His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.

- que:
  - What makes you think so?
  ans:
  - ... Just a perception.

- que:
  - If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
  ans:
  - That's been noted. But where does it lead us? Unless you have something more to add.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:
  - That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - We saw her naked once -- didn't we.

- que:
  - ... Why take me into your confidence?
  ans:
  - That's obvious, isn't it? We have an opening for a new member.

- que:
  - May I ask where your two warders are?
  ans:
  - Lying in the gutter where they belong.

- que:
  - What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
  ans:
  - \"Raban\" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.

- que:
  - It's gone out so quickly?
  ans:
  - -- You mean my Chief has it.

- que:
  - Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain. A great loss.
  ans:
  - All these in the last year?

- que:
  - Where do our records go to in the Castle?
  ans:
  - We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.

- que:
  - We've been together too long. His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
  ans:
  - Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you. Do you know her?

- que:
  - -- How would you like to be in a horrible situation like that?
  ans:
  - Oskar!

- que:
  - Now Ann ...
  ans:
  - What's to become of us now?

- que:
  - What have you got there?
  ans:
  - I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.

- que:
  - Value? ... Value?
  ans:
  - They' re dead.

- que:
  - Native costume?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.

- que:
  - What was it, Jack?
  ans:
  - An ape ... some kind of ape.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.

- que:
  - How about Ann? Is she going with you?
  ans:
  - Haven't seen her - not since we got back.

- que:
  - Are you nervous Jack?
  ans:
  - Nab- Let's get it over with.

- que:
  - Did you fear for your life?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It must have been terrifying?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you gonna start it up?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Coz of something I lost.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - What about him? Yes.

- que:
  - Did he come around often?
  ans:
  - Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.

- que:
  - Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
  ans:
  - Yes?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'd just be guessing.

- que:
  - Do you always have to repeat?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Well I have to close up now.
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Look -- could I use your phone?
  ans:
  - Yes indeed.

- que:
  - Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
  ans:
  - We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.

- que:
  - Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
  ans:
  - I guess he figured it was better.

- que:
  - Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
  ans:
  - What was better? I made better bait?

- que:
  - No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
  ans:
  - I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.

- que:
  - If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.

- que:
  - Excuse me Miss Daniel?
  ans:
  - I said yes, I see.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - My name's John Klute.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.

- que:
  - You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
  ans:
  - Mm.

- que:
  - And you just want to ask me a few questions?
  ans:
  - Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.

- que:
  - Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
  ans:
  - You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.

- que:
  - Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
  ans:
  - What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?

- que:
  - -- OK?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.

- que:
  - Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
  ans:
  - I go on rounds.

- que:
  - Can't you get him?
  ans:
  - Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.

- que:
  - Do you know where he got the dumper?
  ans:
  - He never told me.

- que:
  - Did you like my friend Frankie?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
  ans:
  - It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.

- que:
  - Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls. How come?
  ans:
  - Try some other ways.

- que:
  - What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you got to me.

- que:
  - Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know -- -- too bad? Pathetic?
  ans:
  - Goodbye.

- que:
  - Not much point to this, is there?
  ans:
  - Mm.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Arlyn Page.

- que:
  - Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
  ans:
  - Frankie kept them in the same apartment, it cut his travel-time.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - What the hell do you think's the matter. I could wait for you someplace.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - The same as Jane McKenna.

- que:
  - What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - How can you do it to yourself?
  ans:
  - I don't get you.

- que:
  - Ligourin, How could you do it?
  ans:
  - I told you before, you wouldn't understand.

- que:
  - I don't like getting splashed.
  ans:
  - No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?

- que:
  - I saw Mr. Faber. You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What am I supposed to say?
  ans:
  - Spangler says we have a relationship.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go down in my room.

- que:
  - Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
  ans:
  - Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.

- que:
  - Where'd you spend last night?
  ans:
  - With Trina.

- que:
  - Mm.
  ans:
  - How do you know how bad it was?

- que:
  - You're going back?
  ans:
  - Mm.

- que:
  - Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
  ans:
  - No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.

- que:
  - You wanted to, or you are?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.

- que:
  - Can I carry something for you, to the car? Will you kiss me?
  ans:
  - No. I'm sore.

- que:
  - All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
  ans:
  - It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.

- que:
  - Where, how?
  ans:
  - I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.

- que:
  - How is it back there?
  ans:
  - Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.

- que:
  - You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It wasn't Tom.

- que:
  - That who?
  ans:
  - Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You were hired to look for Tom.

- que:
  - Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
  ans:
  - No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.

- que:
  - I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.

- que:
  - John, how are you?
  ans:
  - I'll be sending you on a report tonight.

- que:
  - What's in it?
  ans:
  - It's in the report.

- que:
  - Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
  ans:
  - I wanted to give it to you first.

- que:
  - They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
  ans:
  - Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
  ans:
  - You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them? Peace in the family. Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.

- que:
  - Has she talked with you since prison?
  ans:
  - Town Police.

- que:
  - Then how are you involved?
  ans:
  - I know Tom Grunemann.

- que:
  - You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
  ans:
  - We grew up together. Kids.

- que:
  - Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
  ans:
  - Everybody's got some, I guess.

- que:
  - Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
  ans:
  - Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.

- que:
  - What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
  ans:
  - He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3,00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Think this is our guy?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It looks familiar to me.

- que:
  - But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
  ans:
  - Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.

- que:
  - What else do you know?
  ans:
  - We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.

- que:
  - Where is the child?
  ans:
  - He's in his room, playing.

- que:
  - Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
  ans:
  - Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one.

- que:
  - Does that distress you?
  ans:
  - Not particularly.

- que:
  - What does?
  ans:
  - The prospect of losing my child.

- que:
  - What do you have here, Billy?
  ans:
  - Detroit.

- que:
  - I see you have people there. What are their names?
  ans:
  - That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.

- que:
  - What about your mommy?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.

- que:
  - What do you like best about her?
  ans:
  - Lunch in a restaurant.

- que:
  - What do you like best about your daddy?
  ans:
  - Playing.

- que:
  - Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
  ans:
  - He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.

- que:
  - My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
  ans:
  - Ladies and gentlemen...

- que:
  - When is mommy coming back?
  ans:
  - Soon. Very soon.

- que:
  - Wow! French toast, really?
  ans:
  - You forgot the milk.

- que:
  - What about my orange juice?
  ans:
  - Right. One O.J. coming up.

- que:
  - When is mommy coming back?
  ans:
  - Soon. I told you before, very soon.

- que:
  - Will she pick me up after school?
  ans:
  - No. If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.

- que:
  - What if she forgets?
  ans:
  - I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay? Don't worry.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Can I be excused? I'm not hungry.

- que:
  - Sure. Too much birthday cake, right?
  ans:
  - I guess...

- que:
  - Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
  ans:
  - That's okay.

- que:
  - Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
  ans:
  - I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry...

- que:
  - You mean for good?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Is that really your chair?
  ans:
  - Uh huh...

- que:
  - Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Did mommy ever see this?
  ans:
  - No, she never did.

- que:
  - Are you going to get remarried?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I hadn't thought much about it.

- que:
  - Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What did you do when you were little?
  ans:
  - I guess about the same kind of things you do.

- que:
  - Was there apple juice when you were little?
  ans:
  - Yeah, there was apple juice.

- que:
  - Was there Burger King?
  ans:
  - Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger King.

- que:
  - Why does he decide?
  ans:
  - Because...Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man.

- que:
  - Like a principal?
  ans:
  - I don't understand, daddy.

- que:
  - Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
  ans:
  - At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room.

- que:
  - Where will my toys be?
  ans:
  - I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.

- que:
  - Who will read me my stories?
  ans:
  - Your mom.

- que:
  - Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
  ans:
  - Your mom knows all about The Face, okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.

- que:
  - Sustained.
  ans:
  - Will you come and say good-night to me every night?

- que:
  - Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
  ans:
  - Yes, your honor.

- que:
  - This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
  ans:
  - I see. Well, you'll have to do better than that. Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?

- que:
  - Does the witness deny the injury took place?
  ans:
  - No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.

- que:
  - Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
  ans:
  - Six years.

- que:
  - And would you describe those years as happy?
  ans:
  - The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.

- que:
  - Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
  ans:
  - No, I did not.

- que:
  - Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
  ans:
  - Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.

- que:
  - And what is your present salary?
  ans:
  - I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.

- que:
  - Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
  ans:
  - Yes. Very much.

- que:
  - Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
  ans:
  - Because my son is here. And his father is here. As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.

- que:
  - Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
  ans:
  - Objection.

- que:
  - Objection!
  ans:
  - Objection, your honor. The answer is, to be generous, very vague.

- que:
  - Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
  ans:
  - No further questions. Thank you Mrs. Phillips.

- que:
  - Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
  ans:
  - Eight, almost nine years.

- que:
  - And did you have a close personal relationship?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - And how did you find his work?
  ans:
  - It was good. He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.

- que:
  - Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - A heavy drinker?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Was he unfaithful?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did he ever fail to provide for you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
  ans:
  - I don't recall.

- que:
  - More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
  ans:
  - Somewhere in between.

- que:
  - Is that...permanent?
  ans:
  - I...I don't know...

- que:
  - Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
  ans:
  - I suppose...

- que:
  - How long was that?
  ans:
  - We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years.

- que:
  - Were you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What about Billy?
  ans:
  - I'm not taking him with me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - How's the new job?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Yes...How's Billy?
  ans:
  - I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault. I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...

- que:
  - You have?
  ans:
  - A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.

- que:
  - You've been living here, in the city?
  ans:
  - Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.

- que:
  - Joanna, I don't give a--
  ans:
  - Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?

- que:
  - Such as?
  ans:
  - Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...

- que:
  - Only can I still see him?
  ans:
  - No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.

- que:
  - Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now. How do I look?
  ans:
  - Beautiful.

- que:
  - But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.

- que:
  - What the hell is this?
  ans:
  - I don't. Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about. It's not even close.

- que:
  - Yes, what?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'll have dinner with you.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.

- que:
  - Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
  ans:
  - Kramer...

- que:
  - What?!?
  ans:
  - I can't. I've got Billy to take care of.

- que:
  - How should I know?
  ans:
  - Murray.

- que:
  - So...what's so terrible about that?
  ans:
  - Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying to do was--

- que:
  - So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I'm going to take it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty minutes.

- que:
  - Three months. How can you tell?
  ans:
  - Mr. O'Connor called. There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.

- que:
  - First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved. Got it?
  ans:
  - That's if we win. If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.

- que:
  - Good. You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?
  ans:
  - Six.

- que:
  - Do you want the kid or don't you?
  ans:
  - Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.

- que:
  - I lost him? I lost him?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you how sorry I am.

- que:
  - What if I fight it?
  ans:
  - We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.

- que:
  - Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
  ans:
  - Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.

- que:
  - Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
  ans:
  - It's beautiful. It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.

- que:
  - John?
  ans:
  - Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.

- que:
  - Ted? Are you there?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Any prospects?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.

- que:
  - How the hell are you going to do that?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
  ans:
  - You ever see her talk to the walls?

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - Ten.

- que:
  - Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life. She's got a husband that loves her. She's got a terrific kid. She's got a wonderful home--
  ans:
  - Things? What kind of things?

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.

- que:
  - I'm gonna keep him, why?
  ans:
  - Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.

- que:
  - I've got enough trouble raising my own kid. I don't need another one. Got it?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - You're on your own, understand?
  ans:
  - I understand.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - How many onions does it say to use?
  ans:
  - Three. And add some basil.

- que:
  - D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
  ans:
  - No. I don't think so.

- que:
  - Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
  ans:
  - Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.

- que:
  - California?
  ans:
  - Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis. She wanted to know all about Billy.

- que:
  - She ever ask about me?
  ans:
  - Uh, huh...Yeah...

- que:
  - He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You heard anything yet?
  ans:
  - Any day.

- que:
  - You and Charley?
  ans:
  - Hey, that's terrific.

- que:
  - Huh.. .Hello?
  ans:
  - Ted, what are you talking about?!

- que:
  - Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying. Where's Joanna?
  ans:
  - Ha! You tell me.

- que:
  - All quiet?
  ans:
  - Yes, Holiness.

- que:
  - Where are you from?
  ans:
  - Kham, Holiness.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - Tell me.

- que:
  - Not the way to talk to people.
  ans:
  - No cried?

- que:
  - Can I do anything I want?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you? Of whom?
  ans:
  - I do, now.

- que:
  - Where will you keep them?
  ans:
  - Here. We'll collect them.

- que:
  - Can I free the prisoners?
  ans:
  - Hmmm.

- que:
  - Are you, General?
  ans:
  - We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.

- que:
  - How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
  ans:
  - It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.

- que:
  - Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
  ans:
  - To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.

- que:
  - CHIN-WU Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
  ans:
  - I have.

- que:
  - CHIN-WU Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
  ans:
  - Soon.

- que:
  - The Sera monks have surrendered?
  ans:
  - It is calm.

- que:
  - Did you receive the letter?
  ans:
  - We did not.

- que:
  - And the United Nations? Surely?
  ans:
  - The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.

- que:
  - I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
  ans:
  - Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.

- que:
  - Holiness?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Oh, no. Where will he go?
  ans:
  - Far, far away.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - Two.

- que:
  - This many?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.

- que:
  - Who am I?
  ans:
  - We do not know.

- que:
  - I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
  ans:
  - I need to squeeze this brain.

- que:
  - Do you have money?
  ans:
  - You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.

- que:
  - May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - How big is Tibet's army?
  ans:
  - Roughly five thousand men.

- que:
  - Is that big?
  ans:
  - No. Not very big.

- que:
  - Will we be in this war?
  ans:
  - No. This war is almost over.

- que:
  - Will we ever be in war?
  ans:
  - In the Pacific Ocean.

- que:
  - Where is Alsace?
  ans:
  - I do not know, Holiness.

- que:
  - What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
  ans:
  - He warned about the future of Tibet.

- que:
  - What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
  ans:
  - The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.

- que:
  - Can India help us?
  ans:
  - India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.

- que:
  - Britain?
  ans:
  - Britain chooses not to.

- que:
  - And, America?
  ans:
  - America, we shall see.

- que:
  - Has anyone died?
  ans:
  - The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, \"The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming.\" And then, the radio went dead.

- que:
  - Where is that?
  ans:
  - In the Americas.

- que:
  - And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
  ans:
  - It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.

- que:
  - Did you ever doubt it?
  ans:
  - I had relinquished doubt.

- que:
  - We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
  ans:
  - Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.

- que:
  - TUNG Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
  ans:
  - I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.

- que:
  - I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
  ans:
  - But you will always be here?

- que:
  - Do you think I must?
  ans:
  - You decide.

- que:
  - Does he have the spot?
  ans:
  - He does, a little spot where the butter had been.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - True.

- que:
  - What does the butter spot feel like?
  ans:
  - Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.

- que:
  - Is that true or pretend?
  ans:
  - It is a story, you decide.

- que:
  - Where is Poland?
  ans:
  - This is Tibet. And this is China.

- que:
  - You will not come?
  ans:
  - No, Holiness.

- que:
  - Am I running away?
  ans:
  - The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.

- que:
  - You, kill me?
  ans:
  - Eliminate you.

- que:
  - Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - How could I ever leave?
  ans:
  - It may not be your decision to make.

- que:
  - You are unharmed?
  ans:
  - Completely.

- que:
  - Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
  ans:
  - If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.

- que:
  - What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
  ans:
  - It is a difficult situation.

- que:
  - I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
  ans:
  - Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.

- que:
  - Did you love your husband, before you married?
  ans:
  - I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.

- que:
  - Does he treat you fairly?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Too young?
  ans:
  - Much too young.

- que:
  - No. Do you?
  ans:
  - You can't take a cow by eminent domain.

- que:
  - And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
  ans:
  - I haven't broken any laws.

- que:
  - Ma'am. Your husband, Bernie. You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
  ans:
  - No kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.

- que:
  - Why are we landing?
  ans:
  - They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.

- que:
  - And what would he do come winter?
  ans:
  - Around here. Yeah.

- que:
  - Keystone what?
  ans:
  - Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile. Bury your friend.

- que:
  - No!! What's with digging the holes?
  ans:
  - Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.

- que:
  - Is this a trick?
  ans:
  - I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.

- que:
  - Was he a good man?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Asia? How... how could he get here?
  ans:
  - Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.

- que:
  - Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
  ans:
  - Bite.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It came from across the lake.

- que:
  - Just spit him back out. Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
  ans:
  - He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.

- que:
  - That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap?
  ans:
  - Raincheck.

- que:
  - And again. How would you get him on land?
  ans:
  - That's actually the easy part.

- que:
  - You ready on shore?
  ans:
  - We're ready.

- que:
  - Where? Where?
  ans:
  - Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.

- que:
  - Can you confirm visually or just radar?
  ans:
  - Radar, he's underwater. But he's definitely coming.

- que:
  - You take care.
  ans:
  - You shoot on my order. If he charges, I'll be yelling \"go\" which means drivers take off. And drive fast, they can move on land. You set?

- que:
  - You talk to Bickerman?
  ans:
  - She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.

- que:
  - Women's intuition. Are there anymore?
  ans:
  - Just those two.

- que:
  - None of us actually saw anything. I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
  ans:
  - If he's here, I'll find him. Did she tell you we had sex together?

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Such the flirt.

- que:
  - And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
  ans:
  - I'm just saying last resort.

- que:
  - As if. Will you miss me?
  ans:
  - He was an Indo-pacific.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.

- que:
  - Oh, bullshit.
  ans:
  - Excuse me?

- que:
  - Didn't even sound good?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
  ans:
  - Yes. You may. But maybe... I don't know...

- que:
  - Could we have intercourse?
  ans:
  - They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans. Tranq him in water, he drowns.

- que:
  - And how would we neutralize him?
  ans:
  - We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.

- que:
  - He's gonna live?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Thanks to you.

- que:
  - Did you make anything of the tooth?
  ans:
  - Yes, it did, obviously. It probably somehow got lodged into his body.

- que:
  - How big do the bears get?
  ans:
  - Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water maybe. But...

- que:
  - And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
  ans:
  - Hank says he's sure.

- que:
  - Never been to Maine before?
  ans:
  - I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. I never believed it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If this is who I think.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook mythology professor. He's done some work with our museum. He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.

- que:
  - In Maine?
  ans:
  - There have North.

- que:
  - Baby crocs?
  ans:
  - Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...

- que:
  - If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
  ans:
  - Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Skipping stones. Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.

- que:
  - Night.
  ans:
  - I beg your pardon?

- que:
  - He thinks they're what?
  ans:
  - In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.

- que:
  - Yeah. Nobody saw anything?
  ans:
  - No. U.S. Wildlife is on their way.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Um... y'know... Yeah.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.

- que:
  - Like little children. You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut.

- que:
  - I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
  ans:
  - I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. That bear had to be surprised.

- que:
  - Who taught you be be a nurse?
  ans:
  - Father's a surgeon. I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.

- que:
  - That's why you're here. To get in the middle of something?
  ans:
  - I heard something.

- que:
  - Thing we can lift it?
  ans:
  - Maybe. Don't mush it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look.

- que:
  - Good idea.
  ans:
  - You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?

- que:
  - Are we crazy?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - He doesn't seem to be swimming. Is he swimming?
  ans:
  - He's floating. Take it home.

- que:
  - Well...
  ans:
  - You wouldn't?

- que:
  - You wanna ride in my truck?
  ans:
  - You sure? I don't mind...

- que:
  - Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
  ans:
  - Probably not.

- que:
  - We set?
  ans:
  - Ready. A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.

- que:
  - You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
  ans:
  - I'll call the coroner.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - White perch.

- que:
  - Are they feeding?
  ans:
  - Doesn't look like it.

- que:
  - Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
  ans:
  - Alright, Ms. Paleontologist. I wanna know why that monster is here. You got a theory?

- que:
  - He just came up screaming.
  ans:
  - Other than to eat us?

- que:
  - Did he say anything?
  ans:
  - He just kinda gurgled. He was pretty much dead.

- que:
  - And you didn't see anything?
  ans:
  - The lake was dead calm until up he came. The tooth is in there.

- que:
  - That's where they keep them. You want me to bring the tooth out here?
  ans:
  - Um. No, no. Let's go.

- que:
  - Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
  ans:
  - Well. At wakes.

- que:
  - This... how long did this attack go on for?
  ans:
  - Seconds. Three, four.

- que:
  - And this is how he came to the boat?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You talk to the married couple?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sorry. I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Lightweight Forward Area air device unit. Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.

- que:
  - And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
  ans:
  - Sheriff.

- que:
  - We're staying in tents?
  ans:
  - I told you. Two days, we'd have to camp.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I thought I saw...

- que:
  - With what?
  ans:
  - Crocodiles. He's an expert on them. And if he's here... then he must think that's what's in this lake.

- que:
  - Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
  ans:
  - It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.

- que:
  - Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
  ans:
  - I asked you to be nice to him.

- que:
  - And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
  ans:
  - He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.

- que:
  - You like Jack?
  ans:
  - What the guy.

- que:
  - I'm just curious. I can never tell what women think is handsome. Is he handsome?
  ans:
  - Well. He's probably rugged handsome I guess. Yeah.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It was like a tug. Something tugged us.

- que:
  - Hank?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is she doing now.
  ans:
  - Are you okay?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look ten feet into the water.

- que:
  - Such a simple idea and it's working. What does that tell you?
  ans:
  - That it's about to go wrong.

- que:
  - Should I?
  ans:
  - Wait.

- que:
  - I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Hi. Listen. Could I steal you a second?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - The somebody else part?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...

- que:
  - A tooth?
  ans:
  - A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear. They say it looks prehistoric. Like maybe a dinosaur.

- que:
  - Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
  ans:
  - I want you to go there.

- que:
  - I. That's ridiculous.
  ans:
  - Sorry?

- que:
  - What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
  ans:
  - I tapped you.

- que:
  - Really? I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
  ans:
  - Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...

- que:
  - Backstabber?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Liar?
  ans:
  - Myra.

- que:
  - Shitbutt?
  ans:
  - I really... I should get back.

- que:
  - Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
  ans:
  - Never cock. Just squeeze.

- que:
  - Thanks, Ardelia.
  ans:
  - What'd I do?

- que:
  - You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
  ans:
  - Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.

- que:
  - Why does she keep repeating the name?
  ans:
  - Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...

- que:
  - Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
  ans:
  - Well, except for the one girl.

- que:
  - What girl?
  ans:
  - The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.

- que:
  - Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
  ans:
  - Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.

- que:
  - How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
  ans:
  - I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.

- que:
  - Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
  ans:
  - You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.

- que:
  - Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

- que:
  - Okay, Miss Starling?
  ans:
  - Okay, Mr. Yow...

- que:
  - You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
  ans:
  - That wasn't me.

- que:
  - I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
  ans:
  - Jack Gordon.

- que:
  - Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
  ans:
  - No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...

- que:
  - Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
  ans:
  - I think we may be, yes.

- que:
  - Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
  ans:
  - Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.

- que:
  - Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
  ans:
  - Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

- que:
  - Who's the subject?
  ans:
  - The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

- que:
  - Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
  ans:
  - You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.

- que:
  - Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
  ans:
  - It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.

- que:
  - Miggs has been murdered.
  ans:
  - Well? Why aren't you there right now?

- que:
  - Murdered...? How?
  ans:
  - I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.

- que:
  - Like I have a \"knack\" for Dr. Lecter?
  ans:
  - Okay, Starling. Let's have it.

- que:
  - Are you finished?
  ans:
  - He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.

- que:
  - What do you see, Starling?
  ans:
  - Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...

- que:
  - But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
  ans:
  - The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -

- que:
  - He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
  ans:
  - But if he knew we have so little time -

- que:
  - You'll back me up with some paperwork? Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
  ans:
  - She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.

- que:
  - Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
  ans:
  - If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.

- que:
  - Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
  ans:
  - They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...

- que:
  - Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
  ans:
  - Where?

- que:
  - What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
  ans:
  - I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

- que:
  - Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
  ans:
  - Not lately. But maybe someday.

- que:
  - And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
  ans:
  - No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

- que:
  - Did you ever work with her?
  ans:
  - Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.

- que:
  - Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
  ans:
  - Sometimes you do.

- que:
  - That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
  ans:
  - I'm - still in training at the Academy.

- que:
  - We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
  ans:
  - Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.

- que:
  - He said - \"I can smell your cunt.\"
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - All that detail, just from memory...?
  ans:
  - Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.

- que:
  - How many women has he used, our Bill?
  ans:
  - Five... so far.

- que:
  - No. You ate yours.
  ans:
  - All flayed...?

- que:
  - No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
  ans:
  - Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

- que:
  - You're a tough one, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Reasonably so. Yes.

- que:
  - And the questionnaire...?
  ans:
  - A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.

- que:
  - What's that, Dr. Lecter?
  ans:
  - Your bleeding has stopped.

- que:
  - Why? Do you know something about him?
  ans:
  - I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.

- que:
  - If you didn't kill him, then who did?
  ans:
  - Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.

- que:
  - Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
  ans:
  - Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

- que:
  - Ahhh... Why?
  ans:
  - Because you weren't wasting my time.

- que:
  - Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.

- que:
  - Who killed your patient?
  ans:
  - Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.

- que:
  - Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God. Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Mmm. And what else...?
  ans:
  - She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.

- que:
  - A moth... How did you predict that?
  ans:
  - I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.

- que:
  - Killed outright?
  ans:
  - You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.

- que:
  - Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
  ans:
  - No. Tell me why.

- que:
  - A cattle ranch?
  ans:
  - Horses - and sheep...

- que:
  - How long did you live there?
  ans:
  - Two months.

- que:
  - Why so briefly?
  ans:
  - I - ran away...

- que:
  - Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did he try to?
  ans:
  - No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.

- que:
  - On what basis would they reject him?
  ans:
  - The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.

- que:
  - That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
  ans:
  - Yes, Doctor. Please.

- que:
  - How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
  ans:
  - Nobody sent me. I came on my own.

- que:
  - No! That's incidental.
  ans:
  - He kills w-

- que:
  - Later, listen, I'll -
  ans:
  - And - one morning I just - ran away...

- que:
  - Not \"just,\" Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
  ans:
  - Early. Still dark.

- que:
  - Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
  ans:
  - I heard a strange sound...

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...

- que:
  - They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
  ans:
  - Yes...! They were screaming.

- que:
  - Where were you going?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...

- que:
  - You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'll tell you.

- que:
  - Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
  ans:
  - Dr. Lecter -

- que:
  - Did you breast-feed her?
  ans:
  - Yes... I did.

- que:
  - Of course it counts. How do you play?
  ans:
  - Officer Starling. Welcome back.

- que:
  - I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now? Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
  ans:
  - Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

- que:
  - The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Why didn't you bury those people?
  ans:
  - Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...

- que:
  - Your \"father\"?
  ans:
  - Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.

- que:
  - The Ottawa are gone.
  ans:
  - He did?

- que:
  - \"We're a breed apart and we make no sense\"...?
  ans:
  - In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...

- que:
  - In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison. Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
  ans:
  - Sorry to disappoint you...

- que:
  - Much further?
  ans:
  - Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.

- que:
  - What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
  ans:
  - Why, I am looking at you, Miss.

- que:
  - They're going to hang you. Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
  ans:
  - Because what I am interested in is right here...

- que:
  - What would you have me do?
  ans:
  - No. I will find you.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.

- que:
  - Are we safe?
  ans:
  - Maybe...

- que:
  - Our father? Did you see my father?
  ans:
  - Yes. I want you to go.

- que:
  - Will you go back to England?
  ans:
  - I have nothing to go back for.

- que:
  - When? How?
  ans:
  - Aversion? No... \"Hatred\"... \"Loathing\"...

- que:
  - Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
  ans:
  - Some say that's the way of it.

- que:
  - \"Some\"?
  ans:
  - Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...

- que:
  - Will you consider that?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes, I will.

- que:
  - What the bloody hell plan is this?
  ans:
  - ... compliments, Mr. Poe. Take her and get out.

- que:
  - Day and a half Where did you get... the guide?
  ans:
  - Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.

- que:
  - Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
  ans:
  - He is Huron and nothing else. Why would he want to murder the girl?

- que:
  - Of course not! And how is it you were nearby?
  ans:
  - Came across the war party, tracked 'em.

- que:
  - Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Fort Edward, then?
  ans:
  - No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.

- que:
  - I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
  ans:
  - I ain't your \"scout\". And I am in no damn militia.

- que:
  - Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
  ans:
  - I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!

- que:
  - Major! Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
  ans:
  - Who were these people?

- que:
  - Head for... for the white water.
  ans:
  - How long?

- que:
  - Where do we go from here?
  ans:
  - We don't.

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.

- que:
  - And if we're unlucky?
  ans:
  - You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.

- que:
  - Any powder?
  ans:
  - Only one or two loads.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.

- que:
  - ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
  ans:
  - You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.

- que:
  - You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
  ans:
  - ...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.

- que:
  - Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
  ans:
  - We'll see in the morning...

- que:
  - You're not coming with us?
  ans:
  - Got a reason to stay.

- que:
  - That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
  ans:
  - Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.

- que:
  - So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French are shamed to do?
  ans:
  - Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.

- que:
  - Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
  ans:
  - It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.

- que:
  - What did you see, Major?
  ans:
  - I'll have none of that! Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.

- que:
  - The Crown \"negotiating\" the terms of service?
  ans:
  - I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it. ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...

- que:
  - Thank you. How can I reward you?
  ans:
  - What a place for them...

- que:
  - Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
  ans:
  - Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.

- que:
  - Webb's at Edward?
  ans:
  - I understand. This is not good place to stop. Two leagues from here. No water 'til then. That where we stop. Better place.

- que:
  - If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
  ans:
  - No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?

- que:
  - Gifts?
  ans:
  - Three, four oxen... much wampum.

- que:
  - Wampum?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - For Munro children?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
  ans:
  - That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.

- que:
  - My son Magua's pain is my pain.
  ans:
  - And this?

- que:
  - Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
  ans:
  - Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.

- que:
  - Their arms?
  ans:
  - They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.

- que:
  - The honors of war?
  ans:
  - Granted.

- que:
  - My colors?
  ans:
  - Carry them to England to your King with pride.

- que:
  - Qui vive?
  ans:
  - France.

- que:
  - Le mot d'ordre?
  ans:
  - La victoire.

- que:
  - We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
  ans:
  - Are you planning on working tomorrow?

- que:
  - You mind if I take a look at this?
  ans:
  - Be my guest.

- que:
  - What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
  ans:
  - These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...

- que:
  - Why Sixpack?
  ans:
  - It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... But he went on that ship and so did Williams... I want to examine the crew.

- que:
  - They found this?
  ans:
  - No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...

- que:
  - Was there such a thing?
  ans:
  - Danakil man?...one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.

- que:
  - But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
  ans:
  - Why stop with just one aspect of marine life? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...

- que:
  - That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
  ans:
  - One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!...

- que:
  - I thought they were your friends?
  ans:
  - Were, Doss were.

- que:
  - No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that?
  ans:
  - He did.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ...
  ans:
  - What dead one on the ship?

- que:
  - Can you fix it?
  ans:
  - No way...

- que:
  - How do you know it was Williams?
  ans:
  - Huh? I...uh...uh...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.

- que:
  - Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
  ans:
  - No. I'm just being friendly.

- que:
  - I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here?
  ans:
  - Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.

- que:
  - Well, I always heard you don't \"learn\" leadership, you earn it. How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
  ans:
  - I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.

- que:
  - What can we do?
  ans:
  - Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.

- que:
  - They know, don't they?
  ans:
  - Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Seeing how my stock's doing...

- que:
  - How much time does that give us?
  ans:
  - Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.

- que:
  - What's wrong with it?
  ans:
  - ...I'd really have to show it to you.

- que:
  - No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
  ans:

- que:
  - How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Beautiful.

- que:
  - But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
  ans:
  - I'm not anxious to find out, either.

- que:
  - What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - You got money in this tub?
  ans:
  - I signed-up for the stock option.

  ans:
  - Itches like hell.

- que:
  - Yeah? How'd the kid hold up?
  ans:
  - It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out. I'm going to get the Doc.

- que:
  - You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for?
  ans:
  - What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...

- que:
  - How'd you do that?
  ans:
  - What? That?...I've done this one before. You hungry? I'm hungry.

- que:
  - Under there?
  ans:
  - Look. Water.

- que:
  - How far away is she?
  ans:
  - Two hundred meters.

- que:

  ans:

  ans:
  - I'm going to try to remove it.

- que:
  - Bigger than DeJesus? How?
  ans:
  - It's had a meal.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - \"Debbie Does Dallas\"... Hell, it's in Russian. I can't read it...

- que:
  - Who were you talking to?
  ans:
  - Sixpack...

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - Sleeping. No sign of Doc, though. I'll check the control room. You look in the shower room...

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - DeJesus...It's got him.

- que:
  - Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
  ans:

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The air's stopped.

- que:
  - Are you okay, Jonesy?
  ans:
  - Tip top, Willie...tip top.

- que:
  - Your pocket?
  ans:
  - The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.

- que:
  - What's wrong, did you miss me?
  ans:
  - Probably no longer than four weeks.

- que:
  - A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six ... no, five days?
  ans:
  - Well, it's still a good idea.

- que:
  - How much did you part with?
  ans:
  - Seven hundred for the pair.

- que:
  - Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
  ans:
  - I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

- que:
  - A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
  ans:
  - I wanted to talk to you about that.

- que:
  - Jesus, Tom, do they work?
  ans:
  - Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.

- que:
  - I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
  ans:
  - I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

- que:
  - Well what?
  ans:
  - Apart from those shotguns.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

- que:
  - Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
  ans:
  - You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like antiques.

- que:
  - Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
  ans:
  - You should see what they did to poor Gary.

- que:
  - Where're the others?
  ans:
  - There are no others.

- que:
  - Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you mean.

- que:
  - Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't ...
  ans:
  - There were two old guns there; where are they?

- que:
  - You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
  ans:
  - All right, all right, so we can say he is good.

- que:
  - And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
  ans:
  - No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot ... don't worry, I got it under control.

- que:
  - Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
  ans:
  - Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

- que:
  - So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
  ans:
  - You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.

- que:
  - I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
  ans:
  - Careful, remember who's giving you this job.

- que:
  - Chris. You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Can I help?
  ans:
  - I think I can help you, as it happens.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.

- que:
  - The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
  ans:
  - Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.

- que:
  - Have you counted the money?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.

- que:
  - They were going to pay, then?
  ans:
  - It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

- que:
  - Hello, John. Nice holiday?
  ans:
  - I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.

- que:
  - All right, furry muff.
  ans:
  - Son?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.

- que:
  - How long has he been in there, son?
  ans:
  - About twenty minutes.

- que:
  - Is he on his own?
  ans:
  - Just carrying a bag.

- que:
  - Let's have a look, shall we?
  ans:
  - It's not him, Dad.

- que:
  - That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
  ans:
  - All right, Dad.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - That's no way to answer the phone.

- que:
  - Is that you, Dean?
  ans:
  - Sure is.

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.

- que:
  - OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
  ans:
  - All right, Kenny.

- que:
  - Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
  ans:
  - It just cost me fifty quid to have this done. If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.

- que:
  - So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
  ans:
  - Er well, yes we do.

- que:
  - Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
  ans:
  - But... Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.

- que:
  - So do you know these geezers well?
  ans:
  - Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.

- que:
  - What they like then?
  ans:
  - Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.

- que:
  - Is there no way they can get back to you?
  ans:
  - Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.

- que:
  - What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
  ans:
  - I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

- que:
  - What the fuck is going on?
  ans:
  - J, what's going on out there? Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.

- que:
  - Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
  ans:
  - I mean it, there is only three of us here.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Out the back.

- que:
  - And the weed?
  ans:
  - Out the back.

- que:
  - Invitations?
  ans:
  - Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.

- que:
  - Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
  ans:
  - All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.

- que:
  - Well, what do you want us to do about it?
  ans:
  - Hit the fuckers.

- que:
  - Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
  ans:
  - What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?

- que:
  - Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
  ans:
  - No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.

- que:
  - You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
  ans:
  - There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.

- que:
  - You what? What are you on about?
  ans:
  - Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money ... I think we should go and see him.

- que:
  - Well, what's going on?
  ans:
  - I mean it's fucking empty.

- que:
  - Who's this fat man, then?
  ans:
  - Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - He means they're thieving dogs.

- que:
  - Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
  ans:
  - What the hell are you doing here?

- que:
  - Everything all right out there, Tom?
  ans:
  - Right as rain.

- que:
  - Well, what did he say?
  ans:
  - He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns ... now.

- que:
  - What do you mean, me?
  ans:
  - Tom, this is our case.

- que:
  - ... What?
  ans:
  - This is our money, Tom! ... Now I think we should go.

- que:
  - Tom?
  ans:
  - I'll only be a minute.

- que:
  - You got it all?
  ans:
  - A hundred grand.

- que:
  - You will what?
  ans:
  - I will loan you the money.

- que:
  - For half a million?
  ans:
  - Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

- que:
  - That you, boy?
  ans:
  - It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

- que:
  - It's pay day, ain't it?
  ans:
  - I wanted to talk to you about that.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I want your bar.

- que:
  - Do you want me to draw a picture?
  ans:
  - No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.

- que:
  - Well, perhaps you can help?
  ans:
  - Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.

- que:
  - Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
  ans:
  - I can't help you, Plank.

- que:
  - What are you doing, Plank?
  ans:
  - What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.

- que:
  - How much did you say it was, Tom?
  ans:
  - You know how much it is, Nick.

- que:
  - And that does include the amp?
  ans:
  - You know it doesn't include the amp.

- que:
  - Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
  ans:
  - I think you're Nick the Greek.

- que:
  - All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
  ans:
  - Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.

- que:
  - At what, exactly?
  ans:
  - My van is half full.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.

- que:
  - Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
  ans:

  ans:
  - Er, fertilizer.

- que:

  ans:
  - I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.

- que:
  - Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
  ans:
  - Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.

- que:

  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - How do you think I got to be a colonel?
  ans:
  - Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.

- que:
  - Chaos.
  ans:
  - Because it's a job?

- que:
  - Why do you think they let us in on the \"deal\"?
  ans:
  - They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.

- que:
  - Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
  ans:
  - No, sir. Not at all.

- que:
  - Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?

- que:
  - You got a cause of death?
  ans:
  - Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.

- que:
  - You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
  ans:
  - Just wondering.

- que:
  - So is Buddy on your short list?
  ans:
  - You got to investigate. No question about it.

- que:
  - What's that for?
  ans:
  - Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.

  ans:
  - Where'd he get all this?

- que:
  - Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and all?
  ans:
  - It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.

  - You weren't in here tonight, were you?
  ans:
  - No sir.

  - I've seen 'em.

- que:
  - You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
  ans:
  - I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.

- que:
  - People didn't complain?
  ans:
  - Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.

- que:
  - No. Is he sick?
  ans:
  - He's going to wish he was dead.

- que:
  - That was the night he disappeared?
  ans:
  - Could of been. That was white people's business.

- que:
  - He ever accept cash for a favor?
  ans:
  - I'm not open. We were just talking.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.

- que:
  - You gonna stay out here?
  ans:
  - For a while.

- que:
  - Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
  ans:
  - What's she singing about?

- que:
  - Can I get this?
  ans:
  - Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.

- que:
  - Hey, Pete. How's it going?
  ans:
  - Time marches on.

- que:
  - How much you got left?
  ans:
  - Three months.

- que:
  - You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
  ans:
  - I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.

- que:
  - Murdered him?
  ans:
  - Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.

- que:
  - Something wrong?
  ans:
  - They've got my Amado.

- que:
  - Got him here?
  ans:
  - Somebody called--something about an electronics store.

- que:
  - Field trip?
  ans:
  - Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.

- que:
  - Want to take a walk?
  ans:
  - Your mother still doesn't like me.

- que:
  - Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
  ans:
  - So why did you come back here, Sam?

- que:
  - We thought we were something, didn't we?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I mean what did we know about anything?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I came back 'cause you were here.

- que:
  - How come it feels the same?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.

- que:
  - So what are we gonna do about this?
  ans:
  - More, I hope.

- que:
  - How long have you lived here?
  ans:
  - Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.

- que:
  - You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
  ans:
  - She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.

- que:
  - The shooter local?
  ans:
  - Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.

- que:
  - Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
  ans:
  - Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.

- que:
  - The Republicans?
  ans:
  - No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.

- que:
  - How 'bout you?
  ans:
  - Don't know if I'll still want it.

- que:
  - Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
  ans:
  - You think we need a new jail?

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I haven't seen anybody come by.

- que:
  - --but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
  ans:
  - We'll get 'em-- So you livin' out here now?

- que:
  - You sell much out here?
  ans:
  - How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.

- que:
  - But you don't see much competition, do you?
  ans:
  - Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

- que:
  - Me neither.
  ans:
  - You think he killed anybody in Korea?

- que:
  - Another woman?
  ans:
  - Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.

- que:
  - I know you?
  ans:
  - Name's Otis.

- que:
  - Otis what?
  ans:
  - Payne.

- que:
  - One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Why you think that was?
  ans:
  - Runnin' numbers illegal.

- que:
  - How come you don't took familiar?
  ans:
  - Been away. Up to Houston.

- que:
  - You going to tell him?
  ans:
  - He doesn't need to know all my business.

- que:
  - So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
  ans:
  - It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.

- que:
  - Mister D'Amour?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's French.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You haven't paid the cab. He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Thirty-five bucks.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Nix.

- que:
  - Nix?
  ans:
  - Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me. See ya around.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - It'll be something hokey.

- que:
  - You ever been married?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She was killed in a car crash. Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - My life was too weird for her.

- que:
  - Billy? This was on Miller's forehead. Any idea what it is?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - doorway) And who's that?
  ans:
  - Take a look at this.

- que:
  - A Nix specialty?
  ans:
  - Maybe they're not tricks.

- que:
  - That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew.
  ans:
  - I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks?

- que:
  - I'm out of here, man! Are you coming?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Billy.

- que:
  - How'd you spell that again?
  ans:
  - D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry D'Amour.

- que:
  - Isn't that French for something?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Why would I do that?
  ans:
  - Beats me.

- que:
  - Who did this?
  ans:
  - All right. It was...

- que:
  - D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
  ans:
  - I know him. I saw him.

- que:
  - He's a priest?
  ans:
  - No. He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you.

- que:
  - About?
  ans:
  - Death.

- que:
  - What about death?
  ans:
  - It's an illusion.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Jesus. Valentin. What did you do to your face?
  ans:
  - It was me.

- que:
  - Why did you wait so long?
  ans:
  - I didn't have the skill to resurrect him. I had to teach myself. And that took time.

- que:
  - And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
  ans:
  - If he was just a man like me, then no. But he's not.

- que:
  - What is he?
  ans:
  - Maybe he'll show you.

- que:
  - Do you wish him to be amongst us?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Will you come to him on your knees?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - So do you. You've seen the future. Haven't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And are you afraid?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did your husband know Quaid?
  ans:
  - Yes. They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while. I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.

- que:
  - You don't?
  ans:
  - I think we make our own futures.

- que:
  - What's the connection?
  ans:
  - I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - He's a secretive man.

- que:
  - And you don't ask questions?
  ans:
  - We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.

- que:
  - Does that mean...?
  ans:
  - Harry.

- que:
  - When do you want me to start?
  ans:
  - Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience. They love him.

- que:
  - I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour. Tonight?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Are they treating you okay?
  ans:
  - I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.

- que:
  - Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
  ans:
  - They won't tell you anything.

- que:
  - How did it go today?
  ans:
  - I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right. He didn't have a lot of fans up there.

- que:
  - You didn't marry him for love.
  ans:
  - Why? Because he had you?

- que:
  - So why did you marry him?
  ans:
  - That's my business. Harry.

- que:
  - Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea?
  ans:
  - Yes... I'm here. And no. I don't know the name.

- que:
  - What about Jennifer Desiderio?
  ans:
  - It doesn't ring a bell. I have to go.

- que:
  - Flesh is a trap. That's what he used to say. Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back?
  ans:
  - I didn't leave. I was just digging around.

- que:
  - What did you find?
  ans:
  - Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.

- que:
  - Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
  ans:
  - It was more than that, I think.

- que:
  - He was the real thing, right?
  ans:
  - Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

- que:
  - Stuff?
  ans:
  - He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire.

- que:
  - He taught all this to Swann?
  ans:
  - Some or it.

- que:
  - What then?
  ans:
  - I was grateful to him. I owed him my life. And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.

- que:
  - He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
  ans:
  - It's okay.

- que:
  - I'm here, aren't I?
  ans:
  - Nothing's going to happen to you.

- que:
  - Nothing?
  ans:
  - Nothing you don't want.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure. He's dead.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - It's okay.

- que:
  - Harry?
  ans:
  - It's all right. It's not hurting...

- que:
  - ...yes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Harry?
  ans:
  - I'm okay. I'm okay.

- que:
  - Is it finished?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - You saw this?
  ans:
  - Crank call. I'll get the number changed.

- que:
  - No word from D'Amour?
  ans:
  - It's better he's gone. He would have done more harm than good.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.

- que:
  - Bad show last night?
  ans:
  - The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic...

- que:
  - Yeah. Remember Quaid?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
  ans:
  - No. I'm not going near him.

- que:
  - What were you doing up there?
  ans:
  - I'm a private detective. I was hired to follow somebody for a few days. A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.

- que:
  - I got a file on him two inches thick. He's a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
  ans:
  - New one on me. Okay. Let's see him.

- que:
  - Where the fuck is he?
  ans:
  - He got up and walked.

- que:
  - For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?
  ans:
  - No. Not yet...

- que:
  - You believe that?
  ans:
  - I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...

- que:
  - Heaven and Hell?
  ans:
  - Trickery and divinity.

- que:
  - Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
  ans:
  - No. I'm saying they were always fake. The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.

- que:
  - So could you walk on water?
  ans:
  - I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.

- que:
  - What about Swann's miracles?
  ans:
  - They weren't worth a damn.

- que:
  - If he was so good why's he so dead?
  ans:
  - You tell me. No? I thought you'd maybe have a theory.

- que:
  - Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
  ans:
  - He was a freak. Everything he did was tainted.

- que:
  - With what?
  ans:
  - Evil. He was evil. Come on.

- que:
  - Great accent, by the way. Is it Brooklyn?
  ans:
  - Fuck you.

- que:
  - Mr. D'Amour?
  ans:
  - Go away.

- que:
  - What are you, my mother?
  ans:
  - I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour. About last night.

- que:
  - Then what do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm here to offer you a job.

- que:
  - Whose is the car?
  ans:
  - Mine.

- que:
  - Havanas. You're not the smoker. So who is?
  ans:
  - You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world.

- que:
  - You know of him?
  ans:
  - I saw him in Vegas once.

- que:
  - Are you a gambling man?
  ans:
  - When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.

- que:
  - Any movie stars buried here?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - Who is she?
  ans:
  - Swann's wife.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Looking for you. I tried the hotel.

- que:
  - Why'd you come here?
  ans:
  - You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Fuck regrettable! I want to know why.
  ans:
  - What for?

- que:
  - What for? You need to stay busy?
  ans:
  - I like to know why things happen.

- que:
  - When will she be in?
  ans:
  - I can't let you in.

- que:
  - Are you satisfied now?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Was that Swann's idea?
  ans:
  - No. It was mine. I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.

- que:
  - Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
  ans:
  - I want to see Swann face to face.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, D'Amour...
  ans:
  - Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - ... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.

- que:
  - A Mister Quaid?
  ans:
  - Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.

- que:
  - What's her problem?
  ans:
  - She has no real grip on reality.

- que:
  - Does anybody?
  ans:
  - Oh yes. We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.

- que:
  - And what does Jennifer think's real?
  ans:
  - You need an ambulance.

- que:
  - Too late. Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
  ans:
  - My God.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You've taken some strange journeys in your life.

- que:
  - The Puritan?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That.

- que:
  - Was he taking a lot of risks?
  ans:
  - You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.

- que:
  - You know Vinovich?
  ans:
  - Sure. Vivovich.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For an introduction.

- que:
  - Are they all in the business?
  ans:
  - It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.

- que:
  - Have you been in?
  ans:
  - A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.

- que:
  - How the fuck do you do that?
  ans:
  - Now I'm going to have to kill you.

- que:
  - Why? So you can fuck my wife?
  ans:
  - You know, it's such a fucking waste. You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.

- que:
  - So Nix won't come looking for her?
  ans:
  - It's me betrayed him.

- que:
  - Will that do? No?
  ans:
  - You think I'm an asshole.

- que:
  - And you're not?
  ans:
  - Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe. That's why I liked Nix. He promised me all these explanations.

- que:
  - And he didn't have them?
  ans:
  - He had something. He showed me how to bend the rules. A little levitation. A few fireworks.

- que:
  - Did she know where Nix was buried?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who else did? Did Valentin?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
  ans:
  - At a guess... they just resurrected him.

- que:
  - Can you do it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
  ans:
  - I got to go. I'm late.

- que:
  - Have we met before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about Philip Swann?
  ans:
  - I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything. He made us think it was over and done with.

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.

- que:
  - Fuck you.
  ans:
  - Swann?

- que:
  - Don't touch me. He's got... got into my head.
  ans:
  - You don't think I've got it to give?

- que:
  - Swann? What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Binding you.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - You could still help me do that.

- que:
  - Why would I want to?
  ans:
  - Because you've got nothing else to live for.

- que:
  - Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they told me.

- que:
  - These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
  ans:
  - Just get me out of here as soon as you can.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Bob, it's me.

- que:
  - You'll do it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'll stay.

- que:
  - How long have you been married?
  ans:
  - Two years.

- que:
  - You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking about it.

- que:
  - 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
  ans:
  - Oh.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.

- que:
  - What did you study?
  ans:
  - Philosophy.

- que:
  - Oh, what do you do with that?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.

- que:
  - Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
  ans:
  - Oh, hi.

- que:
  - Not really. How long are you here for?
  ans:
  - I'm here for the week.

- que:
  - Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
  ans:
  - Ok.

- que:
  - A Soul's Search, Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you feel like singing, Bob?
  ans:
  - No way.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's Charlotte.

- que:
  - Charlotte, who?
  ans:
  - Thanks for getting me back in one piece.

- que:
  - Do you want to have some breakfast?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.

- que:
  - I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
  ans:
  - No, its easy.

- que:
  - How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Did I scowl at you?
  ans:
  - No, you smiled.

- que:
  - Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. My fax said \"have a good fright\".

- que:
  - Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
  ans:
  - No, I was looking at you.

- que:
  - Oh, for her show?
  ans:
  - No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.

- que:
  - And marriage, does that get easier?
  ans:
  - It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.

- que:
  - Did that help? Did you learn anything?
  ans:
  - We established that we have no communication.

- que:
  - Where'd you grow up?
  ans:
  - I know.

- que:
  - Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
  ans:
  - Because that would be too easy.

- que:
  - How old is she?
  ans:
  - Four.

- que:
  - What happened to your toe?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...

- que:
  - It's bad isn't it?
  ans:
  - We should get you to the doctor.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Yeah, look at that thing.

- que:
  - Where's your husband?
  ans:
  - Working.

- que:
  - Do you ever see him?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Do you know where we are?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
  ans:
  - Yes, but no, I can't right now.

- que:
  - You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
  ans:
  - No, we'll find something around here.

- que:
  - What do you want to drink?
  ans:
  - A coke.

- que:
  - When are you leaving?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow.

- que:
  - Why can't it last?
  ans:
  - I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.

- que:
  - Charlotte?
  ans:
  - Hi, Bob.

- que:
  - I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.

- que:
  - Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
  ans:
  - Yes, no.

- que:

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Mr. Kazuzo sent me.

- que:
  - Do you like massage?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Take them.

- que:
  - Lydia?
  ans:
  - Hello, darling.

- que:
  - That sounds great  can you hold on... What Zoe?
  ans:
  - Yeah, its really different here.

- que:
  - Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school. Can I call you in a little while?
  ans:
  - It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.

- que:
  - Bob?
  ans:
  - Hi, Lydia.

- que:
  - Is this a bad time?
  ans:
  - Uh, no.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Is there anything I can do?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know, eat healthier.

- que:
  - Alright?
  ans:
  - Not all that pasta.

- que:
  - I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hello, Bob, it's me.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's Lydia, your wife.

- que:
  - Fine. Is it going ok?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - When are you coming home?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow.

- que:
  - Ok.
  ans:
  - Hello?

- que:
  - Do you want I send it to your room?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Hospital?
  ans:
  - One moment, please.

- que:
  - Hello? Yes?
  ans:
  - Hello, can I have room 5601.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Evelyn Waugh was a man.

- que:
  - Why do you have to defend her?
  ans:
  - I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.

- que:
  - How'd it go today?
  ans:
  - Good...I'm tired.

- que:
  - You wanna come?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Like popcorn?
  ans:
  - I got some hair stuff.

- que:
  - Hair stuff?
  ans:
  - I gotta go to work.

- que:
  - Do you think it's done?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Will you please stop smoking?
  ans:
  - But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.

- que:
  - A Soul's Search, Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
  ans:
  - Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.

- que:
  - Are you sure you have to go?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.

- que:
  - Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
  ans:
  - Promoting that action movie I did...

- que:
  - ...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
  ans:
  - We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.

- que:
  - Do you think they have a room here?
  ans:
  - How'd your interview go? I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.

- que:
  - Bad?
  ans:
  - Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...

- que:
  - Uh...sure...I...what?
  ans:
  - Sushi.

- que:
  - Peter, where are you?
  ans:
  - Sorry. It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.

- que:
  - Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
  ans:
  - Says she can get me in to see this killer.

- que:
  - Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
  ans:
  - I spaced out.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks, Josef.

- que:
  - When did they find her?
  ans:
  - I'm still shaking.

- que:
  - You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
  ans:
  - No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...

- que:
  - There you are! My God, darling, I've been so worried. Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Claire...

- que:
  - I don't know. What are they?
  ans:
  - I found them in your file box.

- que:
  - Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while?
  ans:
  - Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.

- que:
  - ...you wearing a watch, Father?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's exactly...

- que:
  - Eight. That okay?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And how would you describe him?
  ans:
  - Quiet. Real quiet...

- que:
  - And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
  ans:
  - Seemed...on edge.

- que:
  - On the day of the murders what did the defendant request?
  ans:
  - He asked to go home early. He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.

- que:
  - George, come in. What the hell happened to you?
  ans:
  - It's nothing.

- que:
  - My secretary?
  ans:
  - You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.

- que:
  - So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
  ans:
  - Of course not. They put him through severe mental stress. Causing this aneurysm.

- que:
  - Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
  ans:
  - I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.

- que:
  - What did you hear?
  ans:
  - The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.

- que:
  - And was he in distress when you opened the door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
  ans:
  - There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.

- que:
  - If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
  ans:
  - Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.

- que:
  - Is he going to be okay?
  ans:
  - I hope so.

- que:
  - You'll do it?
  ans:
  - I don't have the experience. Father Thomas should officiate.

- que:
  - You ready?
  ans:
  - Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you. And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Something he said, just before...

- que:
  - He spoke to you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It didn't make any sense.

- que:
  - Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
  ans:
  - You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.

- que:
  - You are my son. Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
  ans:
  - You killed my parents.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this to me?
  ans:
  - I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man. I really need your strength.

- que:
  - So...we won?
  ans:
  - Yes. We won, that's right.

- que:
  - We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
  ans:
  - Um hm. That's right, Maya.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - Peter...Peter Kelson.

- que:
  - You just call?
  ans:
  - I didn't know what else to do...

- que:
  - Yes... and you are?
  ans:
  - I saw you on television yesterday. You were brilliant.

- que:
  - Thank you. Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
  ans:
  - You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.

- que:
  - What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
  ans:
  - A narcissist doesn't admit it. It's the extreme of self-denial.

- que:
  - Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
  ans:
  - The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the wrong one.

- que:
  - You're sure? There was nothing?
  ans:
  - I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but hum.

- que:
  - So what'd I miss?
  ans:
  - You're right. I must've made a mistake.

- que:
  - Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
  ans:
  - I had to.

- que:
  - Well, why should I? Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
  ans:
  - We need to talk.

- que:
  - Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him. What the fuck is going on?
  ans:
  - Please, the children.

- que:
  - Why did he try to kill me?
  ans:
  - Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ. So Satan will assume human form. I believe it too.

- que:
  - And the point is?
  ans:
  - At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man. You are that man, Peter.

- que:
  - Why didn't Birdson just say so?
  ans:
  - If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him.

- que:
  - I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents' blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
  ans:
  - My parents are dead. Don't even think of bringing them into this.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - So what?

- que:
  - Do you know your parents' blood types?
  ans:
  - I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.

- que:
  - And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
  ans:
  - When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like... \"The time of transformation is near...\"

- que:
  - What are you looking for exactly?
  ans:
  - Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.

- que:
  - He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished. Peter, what time were you born?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.

- que:
  - What's the bible for?
  ans:
  - Comfort.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I'm scared I'm slipping back.

- que:
  - Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
  ans:
  - I was desperate. I knew you wrote about murders. I needed a way in.

- que:
  - What about after?
  ans:
  - Only your body will remain. I believe your soul will be at peace. If we kill you, Satan can't stay.

- que:
  - I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
  ans:
  - Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car. Be right back. Don't go anywhere.

- que:
  - What can I do?
  ans:
  - You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.

- que:
  - How much time do we have?
  ans:
  - Not a lot.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - I know who he is.

- que:
  - And what are you thinking we should do now?
  ans:
  - I've filed a report with Father Frank.

- que:
  - Suit yourself. But does this mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - You do know, don't you. That these are also numbers. Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666. The sign of the Devil.

- que:
  - What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
  ans:
  - He can see you Thursday.

- que:
  - I plan to. You want a tip?
  ans:
  - Lemme guess. The lottery.

- que:
  - We millionaires yet?
  ans:
  - Thanks for having me, Sally.

- que:
  - Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
  ans:
  - As if there's another cause for little voices? No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.

- que:
  - What do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.

- que:
  - Are you saying he's legally sane?
  ans:
  - Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one. Not even God.

- que:
  - Would you sign it for me?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - He's looking right at me.

- que:
  - How're you doin' today?
  ans:
  - It's another day. I think I'm alright.

- que:
  - Parents died?
  ans:
  - Yeah, murder-suicide.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.

- que:
  - Where is she now?
  ans:
  - Had to let her go. I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.

- que:
  - Monica, what did you do?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
  ans:
  - Pants.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing. So good luck.

- que:
  - Monica. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.

- que:
  - Dad around?
  ans:
  - He's still at the bank.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.

- que:
  - Need any help?
  ans:
  - I can manage.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - Engaged.

- que:
  - Yeah, you met her?
  ans:
  - His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.

- que:
  - So what do I do?
  ans:
  - Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.

- que:
  - You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
  ans:
  - I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.

- que:
  - So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a \"dumb\" jump shot?
  ans:
  - You're the one always turning your nose up at me.

- que:
  - What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
  ans:
  - Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.

- que:
  - So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
  ans:
  - I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.

- que:
  - How is she alright looking the way she does?
  ans:
  - Camille, she'll be fine.

- que:
  - Which one for tomorrow?
  ans:
  - The blue.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day.

- que:
  - So you're still breast-feeding?
  ans:
  - The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you.

- que:
  - You're a caterer?
  ans:
  - You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You love to pose so much, let's see it again.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.

- que:
  - You're cold?
  ans:
  - No, I mean I can check it for you.

- que:
  - I'm an English major. You like English?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - That was two words.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna see that.

- que:
  - So how long is this trip?
  ans:
  - Four days.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You might be the only one with a job.

- que:
  - Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
  ans:
  - To do what you love.

- que:
  - That too tight?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
  ans:
  - Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

- que:
  - Mom tell you to do this?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Damn, Lena... Who is he?
  ans:
  - This brother from my college.

- que:
  - He's in college?
  ans:
  - And he's fine, girl.

- que:
  - How'd you get him to say yes?
  ans:
  - I told him you looked like me.

- que:
  - You ever been in love?
  ans:
  - Too many times.

- que:
  - Yeah, once I cut them off. Why?
  ans:
  - Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.

- que:
  - And what am I supposed to say to the man?
  ans:
  - The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited. Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.

- que:
  - Dad. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you.

- que:
  - So how's the job going?
  ans:
  - You shoot like a girl.

- que:
  - Coach hates me, doesn't she?
  ans:
  - She hates all freshmen.

- que:
  - What's up with that?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Sidra.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Just wanted to say good game.

- que:
  - But?
  ans:
  - No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Never let a freshman take your spot.

- que:
  - How do you say \"you're dreaming\" in Italian?
  ans:
  - Can you take that damn thing off the table.

- que:
  - Just like that?
  ans:
  - Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.

- que:
  - So what are these Spanish guys like?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know.

- que:
  - What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
  ans:
  - Just not my type, I guess.

- que:
  - You ever think about going back?
  ans:
  - One, up.

- que:
  - So...does it hurt?
  ans:
  - It's this big hole. You could almost see bone.

- que:
  - For real?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - So how come you could play basketball?
  ans:
  - I just can.

- que:
  - Your Dad play?
  ans:
  - He works at a bank.

- que:
  - What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
  ans:
  - I don't know. A lot.

- que:
  - What do I have to do?
  ans:
  - I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - Five seconds.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So that means I have to ride with you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

- que:
  - I know this. What do you want?
  ans:
  - A ride home.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.

- que:
  - Big-ass titties?
  ans:
  - Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.

- que:
  - Who's Spalding?
  ans:
  - See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.

- que:
  - Who said I'm not getting recruited?
  ans:
  - Your hot-ass temper.

- que:
  - Would you watch the damn road?
  ans:
  - I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.

- que:
  - You having fun?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown?
  ans:
  - He ain't Spalding.

- que:
  - Early night for you, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.

- que:
  - So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
  ans:
  - None of your business.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You had four offensive rebounds.

- que:
  - You finish the reading for E-con?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What'd it say?
  ans:
  - Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.

- que:
  - I can't be nice to a fan?
  ans:
  - Fine, Quincy.

- que:
  - So you're gonna act salty all night?
  ans:
  - That was so weak.

- que:
  - What are we playing for?
  ans:
  - Clothes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Give me the ball.

- que:
  - Yo, where's the \"D\"?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
  ans:
  - I...can't.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I've been trying to find you all day.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - Nobody.

- que:
  - You want to go talk?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - We're going to get some food.

- que:
  - Can we talk?
  ans:
  - Talk to your new girlfriend.

- que:
  - What, \"Q-man\", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
  ans:
  - You forgot to be there.

- que:
  - I'm not asking for us to be together.
  ans:
  - That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.

- que:
  - You don't think so?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm entering the draft.

- que:
  - When did you decide all this?
  ans:
  - Few days ago.

- que:
  - So that's it, just forget about us?
  ans:
  - Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.

- que:
  - What are the doctors saying?
  ans:
  - We won the championship.

- que:
  - Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
  ans:
  - Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.

- que:
  - Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You visiting?
  ans:
  - Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company.

- que:
  - Who's this guy I always see her around?
  ans:
  - Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny.

- que:
  - So...how's the knee?
  ans:
  - Getting there.

- que:

  ans:
  - I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.

  - One game. One-on-one.

  - I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
  ans:
  - Guess I should have been telling your father.

- que:
  - Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
  ans:
  - \"Can't\" should never be in a man's vocabulary.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.

- que:
  - Yeah? So you up for a game later?

- que:
  - ....Why does he do it...?
  ans:
  - Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.

- que:
  - ...what...?
  ans:
  - I have money to give you.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - It's frogs. It's raining frogs.

- que:
  - ...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
  ans:
  - It's raining frogs from the sky.

- que:
  - M'lady...?
  ans:
  - I understand you saved my son's life today.

- que:
  - And you were not hurt?
  ans:
  - No, M'lady.

- que:
  - If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
  ans:
  - M'lady...?

- que:
  - I can't bear to see you cry. What is wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing... Nothing.

- que:
  - We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
  ans:
  - Mother -- ?

- que:
  - What is it, mother?
  ans:
  - Next week. This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief. I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.

- que:
  - How can I serve you in this?
  ans:
  - If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel. I will kill both him and the man who told me.

- que:
  - Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
  ans:
  - Your Majesty...

- que:
  - How goes that favor I asked of you?
  ans:
  - I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.

- que:
  - What do you propose to do?
  ans:
  - Making the key to the throne.

- que:
  - Porthos sleeps, and you plot. Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
  ans:
  - Soon enough. Here we are.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - A body.

- que:
  - I see that is a body! But where did you get it?
  ans:
  - Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man.

- que:
  - Who is he, Aramis?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow.

- que:
  - But -- what is Porthos doing?
  ans:
  - Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.

- que:
  - But -- what is he doing?
  ans:
  - All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.

- que:
  - So what has changed?
  ans:
  - Perhaps he serves a different king.

- que:
  - Forgiveness?
  ans:
  - Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.

- que:
  - It is also a place of burial.
  ans:
  - Where are we?

- que:
  - A tomb? We're in a tomb?
  ans:
  - Catacombs. Very holy.

- que:
  - But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
  ans:
  - It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.

- que:
  - And why are you so glum?
  ans:
  - I expected action. There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.

- que:
  - I remember that night. D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way. The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
  ans:
  - Well... Well... Okay.

- que:
  - What use am I?
  ans:
  - We go someplace dangerous.

- que:
  - So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
  ans:
  - Why didn't you say so?

- que:
  - Did she have tits like that?
  ans:
  - He's going to kill you, Aramis.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The Queen Mother. Anne.

- que:
  - Who does?
  ans:
  - Best not to ask. Shouldn't even talk about it.

- que:
  - What do we do now?
  ans:
  - I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.

- que:
  - Do I look all right?
  ans:
  - None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.

- que:
  - But -- are you sure?
  ans:
  - Michelle cannot possibly accept!

- que:
  - Piglet -- ? What are you -- ?
  ans:
  - Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now. She loved me once. I want to die remembering that.

- que:
  - Die? What...?
  ans:
  - I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.

- que:
  - You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
  ans:
  - I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.

- que:
  - Midnight! Mon dieu! Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
  ans:
  - They must stay sharp. There was an attempt on the King's life today.

- que:
  - Another? How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three? Four?
  ans:
  - To kill the king.

- que:
  - What is its antidote?
  ans:
  - I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.

- que:
  - You look so sad. Is it something I have done?
  ans:
  - It is something I have done -- or did not do.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Porthos told me.

- que:
  - Whose rooms are those?
  ans:
  - Your mother's.

- que:
  - The room of the King's favorite mistress?
  ans:
  - She will be at the ball.

- que:
  - D'Artagnan...
  ans:
  - Phillippe...?

- que:
  - Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - THE IRON MASK Just... water.

- que:
  - And you never knew why?
  ans:
  - THE IRON MASK The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.

- que:
  - What is it, d'Artagnan? Assassins falling from the sky now?
  ans:
  - The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.

- que:
  - A personal nature?
  ans:
  - What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.

- que:
  - You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
  ans:
  - I just left the garden, it was empty. What did you see?

- que:
  - Your Majesty...?
  ans:
  - THE IRON MASK No, Keeper.

- que:
  - THE IRON MASK What number, on the first page?
  ans:
  - ... Two-thirty-seven.

- que:
  - Who was Athos seeking? Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
  ans:
  - ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.

- que:
  - Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
  ans:
  - Not by you. I will order d'Artagnan to do it.

- que:
  - Now. Where is d'Artagnan?
  ans:
  - Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.

- que:
  - Aramis! I have been expecting you! We are satisfied, that will do.
  ans:
  - Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?

- que:
  - Ah yes, the riots. We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
  ans:
  - ... Nothing.

- que:
  - A letter. May I see?
  ans:
  - From Raoul. He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.

- que:
  - The food doesn't please you?
  ans:
  - It's lovely. It's just...

- que:
  - You would do that, your Majesty?
  ans:
  - No, you may wait behind the screen.

- que:
  - Did you know... about Raoul?
  ans:
  - I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.

- que:
  - Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
  ans:
  - That's the point. He slipped up, and he's desperate now. And that means he's all the more dangerous.

- que:
  - Cooperate?
  ans:
  - Every step of the way.

- que:
  - You mind if I ride with you?
  ans:
  - The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - Alright, stay on the phone.

- que:
  - What did the six-toes have to say?
  ans:
  - Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.

- que:
  - But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
  ans:
  - When did you join the force? You know, the police force, the place you work...

- que:
  - Did you start out area six?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Gotta come from somewhere...

- que:
  - Where do you come from, Marvosa?
  ans:
  - Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - I'll live...

- que:
  - And he took a swing at you?
  ans:
  - Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...

- que:
  - Did he harm the girl?
  ans:
  - Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.

- que:
  - Did you read today's paper?
  ans:
  - Could explain why Fleming was there.

- que:
  - And where the hell is Marvosa?
  ans:
  - He said he was following up some lead.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know - but he's from the FBI.

- que:
  - So where are you from?
  ans:
  - Up north.

- que:
  - Where up north?
  ans:
  - Seattle.

- que:
  - You got any family?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Mind if I turn out the light?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - You know, you don't seem afraid of much either. How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
  ans:
  - Figure you would have tried it already.

- que:
  - You always carry a gun with you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's going on here?
  ans:
  - You'll find out - soon enough.

- que:
  - Why did you set me up?
  ans:
  - I didn't. I figured you leave it well enough alone.

- que:
  - Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
  ans:
  - No. A witness.

- que:
  - What exactly did you see?
  ans:
  - No, but I'm listening.

- que:
  - Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
  ans:
  - Yeah...they did. One girl...

- que:
  - And what did you do?
  ans:
  - I got out of there. I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.

- que:
  - Found what?
  ans:
  - I had it all on tape...

- que:
  - What happened with the tape?
  ans:
  - I took it with me. It's in a safe place.

- que:
  - Neither did I. I'll make it up to you, I promise...
  ans:
  - Where the hell is my car?

- que:
  - Tubbs, it's me.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
  ans:
  - No...I'm in some trouble...

- que:
  - Well...whatsamatter? Run in with the law?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.

- que:
  - Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times. What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.

- que:
  - OK...where do you want to start?
  ans:
  - 1490...Breckinridge...

- que:
  - No thanks. How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
  ans:
  - I knew I could count on you.

- que:
  - I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.

- que:
  - You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
  ans:
  - How about Marvosa and the others?

- que:
  - What else is new?
  ans:
  - OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas. And that's Switzerland's country code.

- que:
  - A bank?
  ans:
  - Both at the same bank...

- que:
  - It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
  ans:
  - Shit, we just started. But I better log out of this.

- que:
  - Are you going to be alright?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about me... ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.

- que:
  - Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - You must be going somewhere.

- que:
  - Mind if I come along for the ride?
  ans:
  - I'm stranded out here.

- que:
  - Are you a regular there?
  ans:
  - Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...

- que:
  - We were fighting - I told him to let me out. So where are you headed?
  ans:
  - Bartender said there are motels south of here.

- que:
  - Where am I going?
  ans:
  - County jail - get in.

- que:
  - Long gone, huh?
  ans:
  - I asked him not to tell me where he was going. I told him I don't want any part of it.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.

- que:
  - Could he handle a direct contact?
  ans:
  - I don't recommend it.

- que:
  - Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
  ans:
  - How are Molly and the boy?

- que:
  - Right. What about sweating Lecktor?
  ans:
  - They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.

- que:
  - How long do I have?
  ans:
  - Twenty minutes max.

- que:
  - When do they go to press?
  ans:
  - Issue the toilet paper tear as a...

- que:
  - Not the Bible?
  ans:
  - No. Galatians 15,2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6,8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Library of Congress.

- que:
  - This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
  ans:
  - Will Graham, Jack Crawford...

- que:
  - Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
  ans:
  - I have to.

- que:
  - You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
  ans:
  - Because it's his bad luck to be special.

- que:
  - Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
  ans:
  - No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...

- que:
  - Somebody hurt him?
  ans:
  - Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.

- que:
  - Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...

- que:
  - He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
  ans:
  - Get him to Atlanta.

- que:
  - What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.

- que:
  - Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.

- que:
  - For Christ's sake, why?
  ans:
  - To recover the mind set.

- que:
  - Is it weird?
  ans:
  - The mark? Yes.

- que:
  - After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now?
  ans:
  - We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...

- que:
  - Personal ads?
  ans:
  - Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.

- que:
  - Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.

- que:
  - It's your call, Will. What do we do?
  ans:
  - Run it.

- que:
  - What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
  ans:
  - We will feel sick for a very long time.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.

- que:
  - What'd it say?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me, everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.

- que:
  - What's it narrow down to?
  ans:
  - Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.

- que:
  - When are you coming back?
  ans:
  - When I'm done.

- que:
  - He's a very shy boy...
  ans:
  - VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Something Lecktor said.

- que:
  - That's why the boltcutter.
  ans:
  - Will?

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.

- que:
  - You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
  ans:
  - He had to.

- que:
  - Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
  ans:
  - No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...

- que:
  - How far away's the back-up?
  ans:
  - Three minutes.

- que:
  - Wait for the back-up! Will?
  ans:
  - It's happening again, Jack...

- que:
  - Let's get to the physical.
  ans:
  - ...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?

- que:
  - ...twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at Langley?
  ans:
  - They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...

- que:
  - What's being photographed?
  ans:
  - The activities of nocturnal animals.

- que:
  - When do you need it?
  ans:
  - In eight days.

- que:
  - Come on in. How about a gin and tonic?
  ans:
  - Tonic will be fine.

- que:
  - How did you come to Gateway?
  ans:
  - They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.

- que:
  - Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
  ans:
  - It's a surprise.

- que:
  - No! Don't go back into the house... It's too nice outside.
  ans:
  - Is that you. D?

- que:
  - My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
  ans:
  - I have work to do at the plant.

- que:
  - Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
  ans:
  - I'm fine, Francis.

- que:
  - Francis? Where are you?
  ans:
  - The developing room. I need to... see you.

- que:
  - You'll come by?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's me.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Me.

- que:
  - Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta. Do you know what I'm talking about?
  ans:
  - No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.

- que:
  - What am I doing here?
  ans:
  - Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

- que:
  - Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
  ans:
  - I don't want to know.

- que:
  - According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said. You know now, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you feel privileged?
  ans:
  - I'm very scared.

- que:
  - Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.' Do you see?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Do you see?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you see?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?

  - Not me.

- que:
  - Are you a man?

  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Dr. Chilton.
  ans:
  - You'll let me go now?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...

- que:
  - Do you have it?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's right here.

- que:
  - Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
  ans:
  - Three, four hours.

- que:
  - This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
  ans:
  - No. I can help you.

- que:
  - Why do you think I called?
  ans:
  - I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.

- que:
  - Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
  ans:
  - You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.

- que:
  - Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in?
  ans:
  - I don't think I'll tell you.

  - He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
  ans:
  - Why do you think he took his gloves off?

- que:
  - What's average?

  - The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago. He killed nine people, didn't he?
  ans:

  ans:
  - One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.

- que:
  - What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
  ans:
  - Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.

- que:
  - What would you call him?
  ans:
  - To yourself...

- que:
  - What about the dog?
  ans:
  - It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.

- que:
  - Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
  ans:
  - He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.

- que:
  - What did he want?
  ans:
  - He asked how you are.

- que:
  - And you said?
  ans:
  - I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.

- que:
  - We have it good, don't we?
  ans:
  - All the things that happened to you before make you know that...

- que:
  - What the hell can I do?
  ans:
  - What you've already decided. You're not really asking.

- que:
  - Huh? Will? Is that you?
  ans:
  - None you'd notice. I'm lonely...

- que:
  - Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. How's Kevin?
  ans:
  - Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.

- que:
  - To do what?
  ans:
  - I have to see somebody.

- que:
  - I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.

- que:
  - You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us. And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay... He's after you now, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.

- que:
  - Do you remember what you said?
  ans:
  - Yes. I said this is too good to live...

- que:
  - Can I have one of your cigarettes?
  ans:
  - You haven't smoked in two years.

- que:
  - Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then why?
  ans:
  - I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you.

- que:
  - Can you quit?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And... where are things?
  ans:
  - Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.

- que:
  - What will you do?
  ans:
  - I have to go back to Birmingham.

- que:
  - Is Crawford going with you?
  ans:
  - No. I have to be in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.

- que:
  - I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
  ans:
  - Mama was probably asleep.

- que:
  - Will? Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer. I want to see you.

- que:
  - What's this Mama shit?
  ans:
  - It's what Kevin called her when he was little...

- que:
  - What's the problem, Molly?
  ans:
  - Small difference, I'm not dead, yet.

- que:
  - It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
  ans:
  - Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too...

- que:
  - Yes. Is Molly there?
  ans:
  - Tell her I called.

- que:
  - Yes. Who are you?
  ans:
  - No, I'm okay. I just wanted to... ...stop by and...

- que:
  - Will it keep them out?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
  ans:
  - In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.

- que:
  - Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.

- que:
  - Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
  ans:
  - No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are.

- que:
  - Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it. This guy wants to kill you?
  ans:
  - We don't know that.

- que:
  - Are you gonna kill him?
  ans:
  - No. It's just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

- que:
  - How did it happen?
  ans:
  - Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.

- que:
  - You went in the apartment?
  ans:
  - Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.

- que:
  - Did the girl die?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - She got all right?
  ans:
  - ...after a while.

- que:
  - And Hobbs died?
  ans:
  - ...yes.

- que:
  - You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
  ans:
  - That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.

- que:
  - Did you get my card?
  ans:
  - I got it. Thank you.

- que:
  - Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - Very interesting, even to a layman.

- que:
  - It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter to me, Will.

- que:
  - There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
  ans:
  - You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.

- que:
  - Then how did you catch me, Will?
  ans:
  - You had disadvantages.

- que:
  - What disadvantage?
  ans:
  - You're insane.

- que:
  - Pictures?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you dream much, Will?
  ans:
  - Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

- que:
  - Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
  ans:
  - That's interesting.

- que:
  - You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
  ans:
  - I want your opinion.

- que:
  - May I keep the file?
  ans:
  - I haven't decided yet.

- que:
  - Do you know how you caught me, Will?
  ans:
  - Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing, your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.

- que:
  - I don't believe in God.
  ans:
  - Fight what?

- que:
  - Why does it feel good?
  ans:
  - It feels good because, if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is, powerful...

- que:
  - ...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
  ans:
  - Pretty well.

- que:
  - Glaser Safety Slugs?
  ans:
  - Kevlar Second Chance.

- que:
  - So I understand you're from Lithuania?
  ans:
  - No. Caspiar.

- que:
  - \"No\"? \"No\" to which part?
  ans:
  - No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.

- que:
  - Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
  ans:
  - Of course. But only on Monday nights.

- que:
  - I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
  ans:
  - That's alright. Where...?

- que:
  - Oh no! Did he get hurt?
  ans:
  - We were just trying to push the envelope --

- que:
  - Hey! Our first phone call! Hello?
  ans:
  - Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled.

- que:
  - What was that all about?
  ans:
  - It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.

- que:
  - I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver.
  ans:
  - So how can I help you...?

- que:
  - So who's gonna pay for it?
  ans:
  - Tony Clifton.

- que:
  - So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
  ans:
  - Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...

- que:
  - What do you want? \"Take my wife, please\"?
  ans:
  - Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...

- que:
  - Excuse me -- ?
  ans:
  - I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant. I love this time of day.

- que:
  - Oh. So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
  ans:
  - Gosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies!

- que:
  - Hi... am I late?
  ans:
  - No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

- que:
  - Popcorn?
  ans:
  - No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

- que:
  - Popcorn?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And all this will be for real?
  ans:
  - I can shtop whenever I want...

- que:
  - Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it?
  ans:
  - They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.

- que:
  - Have you told your family?
  ans:
  - No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.

- que:
  - What?!?
  ans:
  - Each show is worse than the next.

- que:
  - What is this, World War Two...?
  ans:
  - You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...

- que:
  - Sir, do you have a problem?
  ans:
  - Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.

- que:
  - Yes, your Holiness?
  ans:
  - This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.

- que:
  - \"Philosophically\"?
  ans:
  - Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Positive.

- que:
  - Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe?
  ans:
  - I used to think you were original.

- que:
  - Is he in his room?
  ans:
  - Sure...

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Bob.

- que:
  - \"Bob\"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what?
  ans:
  - Bob Gorsky.

- que:
  - \"Gorsky\"? What is that, Polish?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Expect it. Did you get anything from the room?
  ans:
  - Their next target. The name is Neo.

- que:
  - Know what?
  ans:
  - The sewers. Of course.

- que:
  - And you are?
  ans:
  - Smith. I am Agent Smith.

- que:
  - Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - Oh shit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's the third white van I've seen.

- que:
  - Oh, God.
  ans:
  - Should Tank I.D. it?

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's Choi.

- que:
  - You got the money?
  ans:
  - Two grand.

- que:
  - You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
  ans:
  - All the time. It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - I... it doesn't matter what I believe.

- que:
  - You don't, do you?
  ans:
  - If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.

- que:
  - Are you sure this line is clean?
  ans:
  - Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

- que:
  - Don't tell me you're a believer now?
  ans:
  - I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know.

- que:
  - Cypher? Where's Tank?
  ans:
  - He had an accident.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Midnight watch.

- que:
  - Is that...?
  ans:
  - The Matrix? Yeah.

- que:
  - Why you're here?
  ans:
  - ... Yeah.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going.

- que:
  - How many were there?
  ans:
  - Five. Since I've been here.

- que:
  - What happened to them?
  ans:
  - Dead. All dead.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - There was an accident. A fucking car accident. All of a sudden. Boom. Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.

- que:
  - Are they any agent?
  ans:
  - We found him, Trinity. We finally found him.

- que:
  - What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
  ans:
  - Give me your phone.

- que:
  - What is he doing?
  ans:
  - He's beginning to believe.

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - Five minutes. Maybe six.

- que:
  - Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
  ans:
  - Morpheus...

- que:
  - Who's coming for me?
  ans:
  - Stand up and see for yourself.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Yes. Now.

- que:
  - Good. Now there is a window. Open it.
  ans:
  - But what if...?

- que:
  - How do you know all this?
  ans:
  - No! It's too far away.

- que:
  - What do you know?
  ans:
  - You're the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.

- que:
  - Do you still want to meet?
  ans:
  - ... Yes.

- que:
  - I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
  ans:
  - You could say that.

- que:
  - Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
  ans:
  - You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.

- que:
  - Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

- que:
  - What truth?
  ans:
  - The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.

- que:
  - Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
  ans:
  - This can't be...

- que:
  - ... am I dead?
  ans:
  - Far from it.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.

- que:
  - Why do my eyes hurt?
  ans:
  - You've never used them before.

- que:
  - A.I.? You mean artificial intelligence?
  ans:
  - No! I don't believe it! It's not possible!

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Your training.

- que:
  - How did I beat you?
  ans:
  - You -- you're too fast.

- que:
  - I know what you're trying to do --
  ans:
  - Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?

- que:
  - Because... I didn't think I would?
  ans:
  - I thought it wasn't real.

- que:
  - If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
  ans:
  - The body cannot live without the mind.

- que:
  - Do you understand, Neo?
  ans:
  - I think I do.

- que:
  - No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What? Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
  ans:
  - No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

- que:
  - So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
  ans:
  - Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.

- que:
  - The beginning?
  ans:
  - Of the Resistance.

- que:
  - And she knows what? Everything?
  ans:
  - She would say she knows enough.

- que:
  - How does she know?
  ans:
  - She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is.

- que:
  - She helped you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did she tell you?
  ans:
  - That I would find the One.

- que:
  - What do you believe in?
  ans:
  - That's why we're here.

- que:
  - And you still believe I'm the One?
  ans:
  - Yes I do.

- que:
  - Did you believe in them too?
  ans:
  - Morpheus, I don't know --

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.

- que:
  - You're the Oracle?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What vase?
  ans:
  - That vase.

- que:
  - How did you know...?
  ans:
  - You're cuter than I thought. I see why she likes you.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Not too bright though.

- que:
  - So? What do you think? You think you're the One?
  ans:
  - But you already know what I'm going to tell you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your next life, maybe. Who knows. That's how these things go.

- que:
  - What's funny?
  ans:
  - Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hello, Neo.

- que:
  - How do you know that name?
  ans:
  - I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - My name is Trinity.

- que:
  - Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
  ans:
  - That was a long time ago.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I just thought... you were a guy.

- que:
  - Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
  ans:
  - No. It's safe here and I don't have much time.

- que:
  - How did you do that?
  ans:
  - Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - They're watching you, Neo.

- que:
  - Who is?
  ans:
  - It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did. It is a hacker's question.

- que:
  - What is the Matrix?
  ans:
  - When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question. They have to see it to believe it.

- que:
  - From what?
  ans:
  - From you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road. You know exactly where it ends.

- que:
  - What is this thing?
  ans:
  - We think you're bugged. Try to relax.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I used to eat there... Really good noodles.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.

- que:
  - Should I be?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you go to her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did she tell you?
  ans:
  - She told me...

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - ... right as rain.

- que:
  - What did you just say?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.

- que:
  - What happened? What did you see?
  ans:
  - A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.

- que:
  - How much like it? Was it the same cat?
  ans:
  - It might have been. I'm not sure.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It just went dead.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm going in after him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I believe I can bring him back.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm coming with you.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. Come on, we have to keep moving.

- que:
  - Morning. Did you sleep?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Zion?
  ans:
  - If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.

- que:
  - It's a city?
  ans:
  - The last human city. The only place we got left.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - The Oracle.

- que:
  - What are they doing to him?
  ans:
  - They're hacking his mind.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems. It's like cracking a computer. All it takes is time.

- que:
  - How much time?
  ans:
  - Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.

- que:
  - What do they want?
  ans:
  - The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I believe in something.

- que:
  - Dozer?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I lost him.

- que:
  - Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But he ain't here now.

- que:
  - Know where he is?
  ans:
  - Follow me.

- que:
  - What are your plans?
  ans:
  - Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...

- que:
  - It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Look fella...this is private...

- que:
  - Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You got sparklers?
  ans:
  - No, all we got is $40.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Riverdale.

- que:
  - Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash. Now, you got it or not?
  ans:
  - Sssh! Quiet. Y'know that's illegal.

- que:
  - Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
  ans:
  - Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I gotta get the stuff.

- que:
  - Can't we come with you?
  ans:
  - Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business. I'll be back in thirty minutes.

- que:
  - A check? What the...hey, where you kids from?
  ans:
  - You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do.

- que:
  - Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Anybody wanna have a game?
  ans:
  - Jewish...

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Look at her.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - Kennedy.

- que:
  - I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
  ans:
  - It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You flew before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And say what?
  ans:
  - I'll say that I'm travelling.

- que:
  - Waddaya think?
  ans:
  - Not quite...but keep trying.

- que:
  - What happened to you Flash?
  ans:
  - Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.

- que:
  - All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
  ans:
  - Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.

- que:
  - I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
  ans:
  - No, she isn't.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Didn't show up.

- que:
  - You sick or what? You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
  ans:
  - I don't like loading crates.

- que:
  - What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh? You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
  ans:
  - Ok, ok...take it easy. I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.

- que:
  - Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
  ans:
  - I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll break your arms right now.

- que:
  - It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.

- que:
  - I don't get involved with anything, you understand that? Nothing! I'm clean as far as you know...right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.

- que:
  - Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
  ans:
  - You tell me that in front of these creeps?

- que:
  - Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
  ans:
  - Don't be smart.

- que:
  - I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
  ans:
  - Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...

- que:
  - No you're not...
  ans:
  - You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?

- que:
  - NO!!! What do you think I am, crazy?
  ans:
  - No, I just want to help myself, that's all.

- que:
  - What are you going to do? Hide me?
  ans:
  - Good idea.

- que:
  - Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What pipes?
  ans:
  - What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.

- que:
  - That bad, huh?
  ans:
  - I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.

- que:
  - I don't understand, where's Groppi?
  ans:
  - My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.

- que:
  - Oh great...hey - Winstons?
  ans:
  - For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...

- que:
  - You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
  ans:
  - Nope...

- que:
  - You getting out too?
  ans:
  - Yeah, thanks, it's ok.

- que:
  - What's a'matter?
  ans:
  - Nothin'. Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - $20.

- que:
  - How much was the original loan again?
  ans:
  - $500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.

- que:
  - $3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at $3,000?
  ans:
  - Charlie, this is business.

- que:
  - Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
  ans:
  - We'll be here.

- que:
  - Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
  ans:
  - Whatever.

- que:
  - Yeah, where's the rest?
  ans:
  - You're really crazy.

- que:
  - Diane, how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Stripper?
  ans:
  - No...no stripping...as the hostess.

- que:
  - Chinese food?
  ans:
  - Ok. Chinese. We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.

- que:
  - Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
  ans:
  - About that shooting last night...I was there and...

- que:
  - You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
  ans:
  - Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...

- que:
  - Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming?
  ans:
  - Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.

- que:
  - What did he do?
  ans:
  - His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...

- que:
  - What do they expect you to say?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - Well, maybe you missed something?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, that's a possibility.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.

- que:
  - Do you have enough?
  ans:
  - Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...

- que:
  - An apartment uptown? Downtown?
  ans:
  - Maybe, who knows.

- que:
  - Charlie...?
  ans:
  - Nobody knows anything, believe me.

- que:
  - Anything specific?
  ans:
  - You know...like restaurants, night clubs...

- que:
  - What is it now?
  ans:
  - Don't ask.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - A paper on that one too?
  ans:
  - Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.

- que:
  - No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
  ans:
  - That W.A.S.P. bastard.

- que:
  - Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time?
  ans:
  - You know why...with my parents.

- que:
  - For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing. Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
  ans:
  - I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.

- que:
  - Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
  ans:
  - Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.

- que:
  - Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
  ans:
  - We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.

- que:
  - Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
  ans:
  - Sal!... fourteen street.

- que:
  - This is some boat. Your father's?
  ans:
  - Yeah...just had it delivered...

- que:
  - What'sa matter...forget your registration?
  ans:
  - Of course! A double for Michael, Tony.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - Just keep him quiet.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Not bad. $20. Here, $5.

- que:
  - Can you spare it?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Look who's talking.

- que:
  - Did you speak to the Governor?
  ans:
  - He's coming.

- que:
  - His wife?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately. I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.

- que:
  - Just plain 'Joe'?
  ans:
  - Allison, I trust you. This is your thing.

- que:
  - Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
  ans:
  - What, honey?

- que:
  - A name?
  ans:
  - -- Black.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - From the Korean War.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Annie made them.

- que:
  - What about the Mayor?
  ans:
  - ...This shit's not bad.

- que:
  - And that?
  ans:
  - Pinot Grigio. We're considering it for the appetizer.

- que:
  - What do you do that for?
  ans:
  - Well sir, it's 9,30 in the morning.

- que:
  - Red or white?
  ans:
  - Both.

- que:
  - Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications. I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
  ans:
  - We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?

- que:
  - Yes, sir?
  ans:
  - Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.

- que:
  - I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy. But miles ahead of Peter Pan. Like a taste?
  ans:
  - I would prefer some peanut butter.

- que:
  - How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
  ans:
  - Toast? No...just the butter.

- que:
  - What 'business'?
  ans:
  - ...See you tomorrow night.

- que:
  - Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay?
  ans:
  - No, not okay. I thought we had a good thing going here. It shows you never know.

- que:
  - And what would that be?
  ans:
  - You're taking this too far, Drew.

- que:
  - Am I not obligated to?
  ans:
  - Thank you for coming.

- que:
  - What side of the industry did you say you were on?
  ans:
  - I didn't say.

- que:
  - Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
  ans:
  - Here...

- que:
  - Here'?
  ans:
  - Why yes, thank you.

- que:
  - \"Death and Taxes\"?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter.

- que:
  - May I interrupting?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who are we talking about?
  ans:
  - But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.

- que:
  - Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
  ans:
  - Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.

- que:
  - The dagger --?
  ans:
  - Good morning, Drew. Thanks for coming out.

- que:
  - Well, it's a big day. Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts? Last minute refine- ments or variations?
  ans:
  - Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.

- que:
  - A voice?
  ans:
  - In my sleep.

- que:
  - What'd it say?
  ans:
  - Yes'.

- que:
  - Yes' to the deal?
  ans:
  - Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.

- que:
  - ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news. Okay so far?
  ans:
  - You have a way with words.

- que:
  - So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
  ans:
  - As close as a deal could be.

- que:
  - Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
  ans:
  - Is there any more to it?

- que:
  - You're not familiar with the phrase, \"In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes\"?
  ans:
  - I am now.

- que:
  - No.
  ans:
  - Shall we adjourn?

- que:
  - Just kidding'?
  ans:
  - Sit down, Drew.

- que:
  - I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want you to know I value your advice.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - As much as Joe's?
  ans:
  - You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around.

- que:
  - For how long? And why?
  ans:
  - Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.

- que:
  - Mind if I throw up?
  ans:
  - Please, Drew.

- que:
  - What are their feelings?
  ans:
  - If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

- que:
  - What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
  ans:
  - I don't care.

- que:
  - Whose?
  ans:
  - Yours.

- que:
  - Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Certainly, Bill.

- que:
  - Are you running this Board or am I?
  ans:
  - I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.

- que:
  - But who is he? What are his creden- tials? What is his relationship to you?
  ans:
  - In English, please.

- que:
  - And what do I get?
  ans:
  - You get not to go to jail.

- que:
  - Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
  ans:
  - Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe.

- que:
  - It's up to Joe'? Those were his words?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It's up to Joe', huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's what he said.

- que:
  - How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
  ans:
  - He was interested.

- que:
  - -- But he was concerned about the timing?
  ans:
  - The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe.

- que:
  - It's up to Joe'?
  ans:
  - That's what he said.

- que:
  - He said that?
  ans:
  - Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.

- que:
  - What you then?
  ans:
  - I from dat nex' place.

- que:
  - You wait here'n to take us? Like you bus driver to dere?
  ans:
  - No, no. I on holiday.

- que:
  - Doctor? What could be wrong wit' you?
  ans:
  - Nuthin'.

- que:
  - Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - My Doctor Lady?
  ans:
  - Mine, too.

- que:
  - You loved back?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - She knows you real self?
  ans:
  - She knows how she feel.

- que:
  - I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Nothing?
  ans:
  - -- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.

- que:
  - Didn't the family get together last night --?
  ans:
  - Jennifer.

- que:
  - Didn't you call a Board meeting?
  ans:
  - Joe Black'. Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.

- que:
  - How long you here, Joe?
  ans:
  - As long as it takes.

- que:
  - Confused, huh? About what?
  ans:
  - Love.

- que:
  - You love Allison, don't you?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, I do.

- que:
  - How did you meet?
  ans:
  - I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.

- que:
  - But she loves you?
  ans:
  - Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.

- que:
  - The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.

- que:
  - What do you mean 'free'?
  ans:
  - Free to love each other. Com- pletely. Totally. No fear.

- que:
  - You think so? How do you know?
  ans:
  - Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.

- que:
  - Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm lost.

- que:
  - Big'?
  ans:
  - I am Joe.

- que:
  - Come again?
  ans:
  - When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Do you live here?
  ans:
  - No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.

- que:
  - Yes --?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.

- que:
  - Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
  ans:
  - Goodnight, Joe.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Oh goodness, no.

- que:
  - Then why are you here, Joe?
  ans:
  - I came to see you.

- que:
  - Watch me do what?
  ans:
  - I mean I appreciate that.

- que:
  - Why do you love peanut butter so much?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - It comforts you, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes...I've found that it does.

- que:
  - Has her pain abated?
  ans:
  - We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.

- que:
  - How long have you been standing there?
  ans:
  - I don't like the way Drew spoken to you. But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.

- que:
  - Girlfriend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Gay?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To bed.

- que:
  - To bed'?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm tired.

- que:
  - Why don't you get off his case?
  ans:
  - Almost.

- que:
  - Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
  ans:
  - Why, yes. Thank you.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.

- que:
  - You're here?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - Did you like making love to me?
  ans:
  - I loved it.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Nowhere? I'm...here.

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - Oh, I hope a long, long time.

- que:
  - It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.

- que:
  - Don't. That will come later.
  ans:
  - Where are you going?

- que:
  - What will we do?
  ans:
  - Love will find out the way'.

- que:
  - Love will find out the way'?
  ans:
  - It's a saying.

- que:
  - I believe that, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's why I said it.

- que:
  - Did I say that?
  ans:
  - Thank you for loving me.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.

- que:
  - I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I - uh - took him.
  ans:
  - Threw' you? Where?

- que:
  - So there's nothing between you and Susan?
  ans:
  - What a good idea.

- que:
  - Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How long have I got?
  ans:
  - You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

- que:
  - Good morning, Bill.
  ans:
  - No --

- que:
  - And what?
  ans:
  - And I won't tell anyone who you are.

- que:
  - A 'deal'?
  ans:
  - You've got a deal.

- que:
  - You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - Joe --?
  ans:
  - Yes, Bill.

- que:
  - Make an exception?
  ans:
  - There's one to every rule.

- que:
  - Can you keep a secret?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Would you like to sit down, Joe?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - -- What's the deal here? Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
  ans:
  - Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.

- que:
  - Excellent. What is it?
  ans:
  - Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A little Coleman's mustard.

- que:
  - Why didn't you stop me?
  ans:
  - Well...I don't know.

- que:
  - Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Why did you go to the hospital?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You were just curious?
  ans:
  - I guess...

- que:
  - About Susan?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't put it that way.

- que:
  - What way would you put it?
  ans:
  - You tell me, Bill.

- que:
  - Are you going to fire me, Bill?
  ans:
  - Hello, Bill.

- que:
  - Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
  ans:
  - Um -- not right now.

- que:
  - What's okay?
  ans:
  - Just a manner of speaking.

- que:
  - Fish'?
  ans:
  - Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.

- que:
  - You're violating the laws of the universe.
  ans:
  - Spooning'?

- que:
  - This universe?
  ans:
  - -- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.

- que:
  - You are?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What the hell do you care?
  ans:
  - I was just asking, Bill.

- que:
  - Say again?
  ans:
  - I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.

- que:
  - You're what?
  ans:
  - I think you heard me, Bill.

- que:
  - Then what is it?
  ans:
  - Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging. It's missing everything that matters.

- que:
  - So that's what love is?
  ans:
  - Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.

- que:
  - With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Does she know where she's going?
  ans:
  - I don't like what you're saying.

- que:
  - Are you threatening me?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream?
  ans:
  - I am not a dream.

- que:
  - You're not Death. You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
  ans:
  - You're coming to 'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you?

- que:
  - You want me to be your guide --?
  ans:
  - You fill the bill, Bill.

- que:
  - I do? How long will you be staying?
  ans:
  - You should hope quite a while.

- que:
  - And then --?
  ans:
  - This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.

- que:
  - Excuse me? Could I say something?
  ans:
  - Yes' is the answer to your question.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - What you were talking about.

- que:
  - No, you're not. You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
  ans:
  - Are you giving me orders?

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - I want to have a look around before I take you.

- que:
  - Take me'...? Where?
  ans:
  - It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.

- que:
  - The one' to do what?
  ans:
  - Show me around. Be my guide. And in return, you get...

- que:
  - Get what?
  ans:
  - Time.

- que:
  - In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
  ans:
  - What the hell are you talking about?

- que:
  - Yes what?
  ans:
  - Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.

- que:
  - Good morning, Quince.
  ans:
  - What question?

- que:
  - I'm doing great. You ready?
  ans:
  - I am, this is it. B Day.

- que:
  - How's that, Quince?
  ans:
  - ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from. And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.

- que:
  - Next week?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Or the week after.

- que:
  - But he does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I give a shit.

- que:
  - See. There. What'd I tell you?
  ans:
  - This one.

- que:
  - It's okay, Quince. I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that. Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
  ans:
  - The vodka. What'd I tell you?

- que:
  - Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You think Drew will go for it?
  ans:
  - Quince, I've got confidence in you.

- que:
  - Well said, Eddie. Mr. Black, shall we?
  ans:
  - ...It's not over, 'til it's over.

- que:
  - I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
  ans:
  - Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.

- que:
  - Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here?
  ans:
  - No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.

- que:
  - Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish. Talk to you Monday. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.

- que:
  - How did you know?
  ans:
  - Drew told me.

- que:
  - Does Drew tell you everything?
  ans:
  - I hope so.

- que:
  - You like him, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I guess so.

- que:
  - Not my birthday again?
  ans:
  - You're only six-five once.

- que:
  - So what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.

- que:
  - That's all?
  ans:
  - Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.

- que:
  - Daddy, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - What is it, Daddy --?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I'm ready for action.

- que:
  - You know each other?
  ans:
  - We've met.

- que:
  - Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
  ans:
  - Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
  ans:
  - Raise away.

- que:
  - What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Then what is it?
  ans:
  - It's something.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I'm sorry.
  ans:
  - Where's he going?

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - Daddy --

- que:
  - Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old.
  ans:
  - I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan?

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - The fireworks are about to start.

- que:
  - So you're a one-girl guy?
  ans:
  - Damn right. Looking for her right now. Who knows? You might be her.

- que:
  - How'd you know?
  ans:
  - Me? Internal medicine.

- que:
  - So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
  ans:
  - I could be her.

- que:
  - And I want to get into my apartment and go to work. Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - ...It's kind of a pro bono job.

- que:
  - You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
  ans:
  - No, it was so right it scares me.

- que:
  - Because I like you so much. You have coffee here every morning, don't you? If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
  ans:
  - Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor. ...And I don't want to examine you.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.

- que:
  - Slam it?
  ans:
  - Just loud enough to wake me up.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - Should I wear it?
  ans:
  - No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.

- que:
  - I'm sorry... um... ?
  ans:
  - I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

- que:
  - You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?

  - What makes you think he's my friend?
  ans:
  - Seen you together, that's all.

- que:
  - He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
  ans:

  - We're not certain...

- que:
  - I got to talk to my ADO...
  ans:

  - So...?
  ans:
  - Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Right now.

- que:
  - There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
  ans:
  - What's the recovery? How much are you looking for?

- que:
  - What do you like to drink?
  ans:

  - How fast does that go?
  ans:

- que:
  - ...and therafore there is no consequence?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - And why should continuing excellence cost more?
  ans:
  - Cost less. That's the point.

- que:
  - Good samba dancing...?
  ans:
  - Zero risk.

- que:
  - Cause you don't lose loads?
  ans:
  - Cause we guarantee every load. Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good. Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.

- que:
  - And you're our thirty-percent partner?
  ans:
  - The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.

- que:

  ans:
  - I would say you're... ...four percentage points away from a deal...

  ans:
  - ...to fall back on. You know, a fail-safe. Insurance.

  ans:
  - A few more moments, still in this business. Then I'd find you.

- que:
  - Yero, by himself?
  ans:
  - Maybe. Maybe with the crazy whites.

- que:
  - What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail? You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I know. And now?
  ans:
  - Jos...

- que:
  - You afraid of violence?
  ans:
  - I am not John Wayne. There is no \"S\" on his chest. We get down if the play calls for it. But we are into business and making money.

- que:
  - Red light, green light, Jos?
  ans:
  - Client got delivery. But there were...\"extras\" in the back of the truck.

- que:
  - He didn't. Interrogation's not in our skill set. So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
  ans:
  - Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...

- que:
  - Packaging?
  ans:
  - Fifty-gallon drums. Thirty-two. A hundred kilos in each. You transship that to the Malaysian boat.

  - Something's wrong.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - We could try to run loads into these guys. Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida. Into this group.

- que:
  - What kind of weight?
  ans:
  - Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Where we meeting 'em...?
  ans:
  - Port-Au-Prince.

- que:
  - What do we got?
  ans:

- que:
  - How much we looking for?
  ans:

  - Verdado.

- que:
  - Verdado where?
  ans:
  - It's in the suburbs outside Havana.

- que:
  - ...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're not makin' a move on her...?
  ans:
  - We're makin' moves on each other.

- que:
  - And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
  ans:
  - I am asking. You to me.

- que:
  - Do you believe...I have forgotten I am a cop?
  ans:
  - I would never doubt you.

- que:
  - What's your take?
  ans:
  - What's the point? It's going down.

- que:
  - Switek?
  ans:
  - If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - This is Agent James Fujima.

- que:
  - What's your Miami PD badge number?
  ans:
  - 4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.

- que:
  - How do I discuss operations over an open line?
  ans:
  - Guy's involved in a \"meet\"...

- que:
  - That's right.
  ans:
  - \"Buy and walk\"? \"Buy and bust\"? \"Reverse undercover\"? What?

- que:
  - OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
  ans:
  - NLR, we think. I wanna know...

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - We don't know.

- que:
  - So what do you want?
  ans:
  - To recruit you.

- que:
  - From whom...?
  ans:
  - A Colombian producer. Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.

- que:
  - Out of...?
  ans:
  - Haiti and Puerto Rico. Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.

- que:
  - Sonny...?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where's Riccardo?
  ans:
  - On the phone.

- que:
  - Alonzo? What are you talking about? Where are you...?
  ans:
  - They had me from the gate.

- que:
  - Goodbye.
  ans:
  - Where are you?

- que:
  - Correct. Flash samples. Flash cash.
  ans:
  - How'd they get onto you?

- que:
  - Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
  ans:
  - White supremacist types.

- que:
  - Break your encryption? Hack your e- mail? Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
  ans:
  - As in, your ass is dead in the water.

- que:
  - Reverse undercover? WE supply to them?
  ans:
  - They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...

- que:
  - Who are you talking to?
  ans:
  - He's talking to you, bro. What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Switek pulling this off...? That's not faith; that's delusional...

- que:
  - What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
  ans:
  - Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Nothing. Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
  ans:
  - Bored.

- que:
  - What flowers?
  ans:
  - The bouquet, here. Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.

- que:
  - ...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
  ans:
  - You mean with the flowers...?

- que:
  - Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
  ans:
  - Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.

- que:
  - Not French registry?
  ans:
  - They've been targeted. And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I think Jos suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate. And people, who are good at what they do? They have egos, too...

- que:
  - What would you do...?
  ans:
  - Define small.

- que:
  - Conveyance?
  ans:
  - Maritime. Jose will fill you in.

- que:
  - Meaning...?
  ans:
  - They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.

- que:
  - And violence is extra. And expensive. So how much weight you looking to move?
  ans:
  - Nothing. 'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like. Maybe this does not work.

- que:
  - Then what were we talking to you for?
  ans:
  - I had to lay eyes on you.

- que:

- que:
  - Weird shit...?
  ans:
  - Take a look.

- que:
  - There's really people living down here?
  ans:
  - Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Track bunnies. Rats. They're usually around.

- que:
  - H-how do I get...?
  ans:
  - Way we came. Take the first tunnel to your right...

- que:
  - Go left. Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
  ans:
  - I think so. One right, two lefts...

- que:
  - Fine. You want me to call your supervisor?
  ans:
  - Please do. He's a lonely guy.

- que:
  - For Chrissakes. You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
  ans:
  - You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.

  - Oh, that's gonna work.
  ans:
  - 20 minutes. Susan?

- que:
  - Any luck?
  ans:
  - Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks. Ain't gonna be much use, though. Lines are dead.

  - You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
  ans:
  - Oh, man, there you go again.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Those things bring juice to the new stations. You just can't rewire that shit...

- que:
  - For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...

- que:
  - Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.

- que:
  - \"Mistake\"? What's that supposed to...?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter, all right? It's dead.

- que:
  - Is there a switch?
  ans:
  - Third rail is dead. Get me up. There must be a manual override in the booth.

- que:
  - Can we get this car there?
  ans:
  - Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.

- que:
  - Depends. You got a memo?
  ans:
  - The kid...

- que:
  - What are you doing down here?
  ans:
  - Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere... Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.

- que:
  - What are you putting that crap on me for?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean...

- que:
  - Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
  ans:
  - Who know? We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.

- que:
  - We're down to a \"couple\" now, huh?
  ans:
  - You know where they get this fertility stuff? They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.

- que:
  - Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
  ans:
  - You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.

- que:
  - We?
  ans:
  - Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...

- que:
  - Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Metaxonycha Godmani.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Honey, just leave it.

- que:
  - You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
  ans:
  - I heard how you talked to him.

- que:
  - Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
  ans:
  - He was just doing his job.

- que:
  - It's me. Can you hear me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...

- que:
  - Try not to sweat?
  ans:
  - I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...

- que:
  - Gross. What is it?
  ans:
  - An \"Ootheca\". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh \"weirdbugs\" inside.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She used a baster.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.

- que:
  - I have no idea. Are you ready?
  ans:
  - It bit you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's impossible. Insects don't...

- que:
  - Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.

- que:
  - What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - Anything you can tell me might help.

- que:
  - Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
  ans:
  - Sounds good.

- que:
  - Here.
  ans:
  - How long...?

- que:
  - What are they...?
  ans:
  - They're called Novril--they're for your pain.

- que:
  - Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
  ans:
  - The blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.

- que:
  - Will I be able to walk?
  ans:
  - No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.

- que:
  - Following me?
  ans:
  - Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--

- que:
  - You want to read it?
  ans:
  - If you wouldn't mind.

- que:
  - What's your new book called?
  ans:
  - I don't have a title yet.

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
  ans:
  - I can take it, go ahead.

- que:
  - The profanity bothers you?
  ans:
  - It has no nobility.

- que:
  - The phones are working?
  ans:
  - My daughter must be going nuts.

- que:
  - Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
  ans:
  - No. No, it isn't, it's-- --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would \"great\" be insulting?

- que:
  - I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
  ans:
  - You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.

- que:
  - Misery?
  ans:
  - Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.

- que:
  - The Sistine Chapel?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...

- que:
  - Done?
  ans:
  - Yeah, thanks.

- que:
  - I DIDN'T...
  ans:
  - You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?

- que:
  - Then who did?
  ans:
  - No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.

- que:
  - I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You want me to burn my book?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You want me to burn my book?
  ans:
  - I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - See, isn't this nice?
  ans:
  - Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.

- que:
  - Set what up?
  ans:
  - That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.

- que:
  - Misery's Return?
  ans:
  - I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.

- que:
  - You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
  ans:
  - I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

- que:
  - You--fooler...! Did I do good?
  ans:
  - But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.

- que:
  - Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.

- que:
  - Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
  ans:
  - You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah...
  ans:
  - Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?

- que:
  - Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
  ans:
  - Have to wait.

- que:
  - Oh...
  ans:
  - Not even a hint?

- que:
  - I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
  ans:
  - My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.

- que:
  - A toast?
  ans:
  - Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.

- que:
  - Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.

- que:
  - Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
  ans:
  - Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.

- que:
  - You really think so?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.

- que:
  - Annie, what is it?
  ans:
  - The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.

- que:
  - Why would you lose me?
  ans:
  - The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You've been out of your room.

- que:
  - Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.

- que:
  - Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
  ans:
  - Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...

- que:
  - The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
  ans:
  - I'm glad you like it.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

- que:
  - Four or five days ago. Why?
  ans:
  - Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

- que:
  - What? What is it?
  ans:
  - Could be the weight of the snow.

- que:
  - You really think Sheldon's out there?
  ans:
  - Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.

- que:
  - Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek. Any calls?
  ans:
  - Just from his agent.

- que:
  - You don't think he's dead, do you?
  ans:
  - It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.

- que:
  - What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
  ans:
  - Oh, I like that tone.

- que:
  - What thing?
  ans:
  - That thing. Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

- que:
  - Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - He's your client, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes, he is.

- que:
  - You think he might be missing?
  ans:
  - I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.

- que:
  - No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
  ans:
  - So do I...

- que:
  - Answer me a couple things?
  ans:
  - If I can.

- que:
  - Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
  ans:
  - We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.

- que:
  - You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.

- que:
  - Has she been buying any odd things lately?
  ans:
  - Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd.

- que:
  - Newspapers?
  ans:
  - No, the typing kind.

- que:
  - Did they win?
  ans:
  - Yeah. They're in the semis.

- que:
  - Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
  ans:
  - Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.

- que:
  - You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
  ans:
  - Sean, please..

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - In the envelope in my pocket. My right.. jacket..pocket..

- que:
  - How grateful?
  ans:
  - Well that depends.

- que:
  - How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
  ans:
  - How I usually find you, Nyah.

- que:
  - And my room?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..

- que:
  - Well, that's good, isn't?
  ans:
  - Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.

- que:
  - To do what?
  ans:
  - Sort it all out.

- que:
  - A change of plans?
  ans:
  - Yes. We won't be able to have dinner tonight. Something's come up. I hope you don't mind.

- que:
  - Feel like pleading for your life?
  ans:
  - Not as much as you feel like hearing it.

- que:
  - God damn it, Nyah! Why did you do it? Why did you save that bastard?
  ans:
  - If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz. G'day.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In downtown Sydney for a start.

- que:
  - And you're happy about that?
  ans:
  - Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.

- que:
  - Why, you going to make me a better offer?
  ans:
  - Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not really.

- que:
  - Not exactly. Wallis?
  ans:
  - More like two-two point two million.

- que:
  - A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
  ans:
  - ..or hard wired..

- que:
  - Not at all. But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
  ans:
  - Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - It is, Billy.

- que:
  - What manic invents disease like that in the first place? Why would he do it?
  ans:
  - So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.

- que:
  - There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
  ans:
  - ..in the building...

- que:
  - That's it? That's it? That's it?
  ans:
  - And the check's in the mall.

- que:
  - How much longer before you can reach him?
  ans:
  - Five and a half minutes. He's breached the hot zone..

- que:
  - How're we doin', then?
  ans:
  - He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.

- que:
  - What can we do' mate?
  ans:
  - Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.

- que:
  - No. Should I?
  ans:
  - No. You just looked as if you did.

- que:
  - What if I pay the rent?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
  ans:
  - I see. You're not just another pretty face..

- que:
  - Would you mind if I'm on top?
  ans:
  - Oh, either way works for me.

- que:
  - right..where is it?
  ans:
  - Far right.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - Indeed.

- que:
  - If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
  ans:
  - Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.

- que:
  - Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
  ans:
  - Hi. Would you mind slowing down?

- que:
  - Listen to what?
  ans:
  - I need your help and I thin you can use mine.

- que:
  - Your help? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away.

- que:
  - What's you name?
  ans:
  - Ethan Hunt.

- que:
  - Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
  ans:
  - Awfully short notice..

- que:
  - Care to wait a decent interval?
  ans:
  - Who wants to be decent?..

- que:
  - They've got a book for this?
  ans:
  - They've got a book for everything.

- que:
  - Which is?
  ans:
  - That they're lying.

- que:
  - So where did I got right?
  ans:
  - You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - Ask a question, you get an answer!..

- que:
  - What's the population of Seville any idea?
  ans:
  - Five, six-hundred thousand.

- que:
  - That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
  ans:
  - Sean Ambrose, for one.

- que:
  - You've either got it or you don't. Let your conscience be your guide?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Someone in possession of all the facts. Are you telling me I have to do this?
  ans:
  - Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.

- que:
  - Can you think of a better one?
  ans:
  - Not me. I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.

- que:
  - Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
  ans:
  - Much.

- que:
  - What wouldn't make him suspicious?
  ans:
  - Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - You'll be fine. I'm going to lose you.

- que:
  - How's it going? Everything okay?
  ans:
  - Just like old times.

- que:
  - Just like old times?
  ans:
  - Just about..

- que:
  - Have you met them?
  ans:
  - I've no doubt.

- que:
  - Affirmative.
  ans:
  - Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times. What's that about?

- que:
  - Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
  ans:
  - I'll muddle through.

- que:
  - Why? What's happened. What did you see?
  ans:
  - Nyah, you've done more than enough. Even the best of snake charmers get bit.

- que:
  - How do you suggest I go about it?
  ans:
  - Easy, easy, easy, shhh!

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out of here.

- que:
  - Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
  ans:
  - Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..

- que:
  - I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No. Should I?
  ans:
  - No. You just looked as if you did.

- que:
  - An idea, yeah.
  ans:
  - Why did you phrase it like that?

- que:
  - If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
  ans:
  - You were there.

- que:
  - When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what? Two, three times?
  ans:
  - Twice.

- que:
  - You know we had reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
  ans:
  - Not necessarily.

- que:
  - Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
  ans:
  - Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

- que:
  - The question is why? What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
  ans:
  - Right now only Ambrose knows that.

- que:
  - And then what?
  ans:
  - Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.

- que:
  - Aren't you even curious? About why she did it?
  ans:
  - No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt..

- que:
  - Sorry, Ethan. I don't quite know where to begin. Any suggestions?
  ans:
  - You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.

- que:
  - Where is she now, by the way? Do you know?
  ans:
  - I don't. No exactly.

- que:
  - Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
  ans:
  - Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.

- que:
  - He was quite a man. Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
  ans:
  - Yes, he knew. Just..

- que:
  - ..I'm fine..and you?
  ans:
  - I'm fine..

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.

- que:
  - Nekhorvich's boss?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Left jacket pocket?
  ans:
  - Roger that.

- que:
  - Nyah still on the property?
  ans:
  - Let's start from the inside out.

- que:
  - So what did he say?
  ans:
  - Good job. And thanks.

- que:
  - It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
  ans:
  - You are infected with Chimera, my friend.

- que:
  - You took it! All of it! And what if I need it?
  ans:
  - If?' My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with Chimera needed it as well.

- que:
  - Oh, please! How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
  ans:
  - That's S.O.P..

- que:
  - What about him...?
  ans:
  - Only four more cars.

- que:
  - Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
  ans:
  - High speed train. No-one gets on. No- one gets off. High security. Good place for a pass off to Max.

- que:
  - But why tell us?
  ans:
  - Hes putting on a show, Barnes.

- que:
  - Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
  ans:
  - Two minutes til Krieger shows. Thisll have to be quicker than Id like. Certainly quicker than youd like.

- que:
  - Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
  ans:
  - Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.

- que:
  - Satisfied?
  ans:
  - All ten million.

- que:
  - Now we dont have to eliminate him? You like that, dont you Claire? Dont you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is he serious?
  ans:
  - Always.

- que:
  - Krieger can get it. Right?
  ans:
  - We got it. On your feet.

- que:
  - Are you all right Ethan. What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes.

- que:
  - Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay. It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Don't move.

- que:
  - What happened to Jim?
  ans:
  - There was nobody on the bridge.

- que:
  - What happened to Jim?
  ans:
  - They're dead. Jim's dead.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...

- que:
  - Max made a deal with you?
  ans:
  - I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.

- que:
  - You're sure about this?
  ans:
  - Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.

- que:
  - May I come in?
  ans:
  - Sure...

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - He's expecting my call. I'm going to the station... And I'm going to call him.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I sent the message to Max. Were on for tomorrow.

- que:
  - Is this the only way?
  ans:
  - Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...

- que:
  - Two cars. Where are you?
  ans:
  - You are my eyes. Stay with him.

- que:
  - Ethan?
  ans:
  - Claire...Hey...

- que:
  - Are you damaged?
  ans:
  - They knew we were coming. Golitsyns dead too. The disk is gone.

- que:
  - Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed?
  ans:
  - I dont think so.

- que:
  - Dont think. Are you clean?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Youre in Prague?
  ans:
  - Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Dont disappoint me.

- que:
  - Who else is left?
  ans:
  - Yes. I see your point.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
  ans:
  - Certainly Ethan.

- que:
  - What are we downloading?
  ans:
  - Information.

- que:
  - What kind?
  ans:
  - Profitable.

- que:
  - What makes you trust me?
  ans:
  - Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.

- que:
  - Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing?
  ans:
  - It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.

- que:
  - You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
  ans:
  - I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then, maybe, talk about it.

- que:
  - Why don't you come back with me?
  ans:
  - Just don't know why I'd be doing it.

- que:
  - He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
  ans:
  - Oh man...I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

- que:
  - Who are you and what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I need one hundred thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
  ans:
  - Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.

- que:
  - On what?
  ans:
  - Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Like Job?
  ans:
  - Ah, but, we're asking about you.

- que:
  - Why, may I ask?
  ans:
  - That's the question I want to ask Job.

- que:
  - Why should I?
  ans:
  - It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.

- que:
  - Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
  ans:
  - Very good.

- que:
  - What was your deal with Job?
  ans:
  - Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by the end of the week.

- que:
  - How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days? It's been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy?
  ans:
  - I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.

- que:
  - What about Job?
  ans:
  - I wouldnt worry about him. Once youve got the money -- hell find you.

- que:
  - What sector's the air conditioning?
  ans:
  - Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.

- que:
  - Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building?
  ans:
  - Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go.

- que:
  - Bank?
  ans:
  - IMF mainframe.

- que:
  - Where exactly is it?
  ans:
  - In Langley.

- que:
  - What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
  ans:
  - Claire.

- que:
  - Sorry, am I interrupting?
  ans:
  - You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission.

- que:
  - Then what am I doing here?
  ans:
  - Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.

- que:
  - Oh? What's the problem?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me.

- que:
  - Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.

- que:
  - You're going to use Walter?
  ans:
  - He's our guy.

- que:
  - Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
  ans:
  - Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.

- que:
  - No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
  ans:
  - Sure. If the main character does.

- que:
  - If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable?
  ans:
  - Jack's pinned down Sarah. Should be a second. Keep dancing.

- que:
  - Can you lose him?
  ans:
  - No. Abort.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Whats going to make him do that?
  ans:
  - What he didnt get in Prague. The NOC list.

- que:
  - Jim...?
  ans:
  - Keep counting Claire.

- que:
  - No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
  ans:
  - Loud and clear.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why don't you take a look?
  ans:
  - Jack...that's spying.

- que:
  - That's what we do isn't it?
  ans:
  - Jack you're so wicked.

- que:
  - Too wicked to have a drink later?
  ans:
  - I think I might just take that look.

- que:
  - How long until we reach the Chunnel?
  ans:
  - Twenty minutes.

- que:
  - Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the batteries?
  ans:
  - I always check the batteries.

- que:
  - The Shawfish?
  ans:
  - Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.

- que:
  - Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
  ans:
  - Very good, Mr. Johnny.

- que:
  - Who's dead?
  ans:
  - Nobody. Loretta is getting married.

- que:
  - Rita. Pass the wine.
  ans:
  - You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?

- que:
  - Where you been?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.

- que:
  - Have I been a good wife?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna talk about it.

- que:
  - Where's Ma?
  ans:
  - Bed.

- que:
  - You're not sleepy?
  ans:
  - I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.

- que:
  - What's your news?
  ans:
  - I'm getting married.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What killed him?
  ans:
  - He got hit by a bus.

- que:
  - Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
  ans:
  - He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.

- que:
  - More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
  ans:
  - In a month.

- que:
  - He did?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - So you'll come to the wedding, right?
  ans:
  - Let's go tell your Mother.

- que:
  - What'd you do to your hair?
  ans:
  - I got it done.

- que:
  - And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
  ans:
  - What are you doing here?

- que:
  - And what did they say?
  ans:
  - The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.

- que:
  - Why you looking around so much?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I got a feeling.

- que:
  - Why didn't he call himself?
  ans:
  - He's in Palermo.

- que:
  - Have you come from my brother?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm going to marry him.

- que:
  - You are going to marry my brother?
  ans:
  - Yes. Do you want...

- que:
  - That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - Loretta. What's that smell?
  ans:
  - I'm making you a steak.

- que:
  - Where'd Johnny find you?
  ans:
  - He knew my husband who died.

- que:
  - How'd he die?
  ans:
  - Bus hit him.

- que:
  - When you get engaged?
  ans:
  - Yesterday.

- que:
  - Why what?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When your husband get hit by the bus?
  ans:
  - Seven years ago.

- que:
  - How many men since then?
  ans:
  - Just Johnny.

- que:
  - You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
  ans:
  - She was right to leave me.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - To the bed.

  ans:

  ans:
  - I'm afraid of who I am.

- que:
  - Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
  ans:
  - Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.

- que:
  - A month from today?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - He's my younger brother.

- que:
  - We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How was your plane ride?
  ans:
  - The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away.

- que:
  - Have you told her we're getting married?
  ans:
  - Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.

- que:
  - WHAT?
  ans:
  - If I marry you my mother will die.

- que:
  - Where's the ring?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And who's gonna pay for that?
  ans:
  - Pop.

- que:
  - Will you live here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Pop don't like Johnny.

- que:
  - How's the mother?
  ans:
  - She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.

  ans:
  - Hi, Loretta.

- que:
  - Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
  ans:
  - We just come from the bank.

- que:
  - Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
  ans:
  - I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.

- que:
  - Moving in?
  ans:
  - I came right from the airport.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.

- que:
  - Maybe I should go?
  ans:
  - What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - You're kidding?

- que:
  - But why would a man need more than one woman?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.

- que:
  - You don't know where Loretta is?
  ans:
  - No idea.

- que:
  - Have you come to make peace with me?
  ans:
  - I am alone in the world.

- que:
  - She was just too young for you.
  ans:
  - Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?

- que:
  - Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
  ans:
  - None of your business.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.

- que:
  - That woman was a student of yours?
  ans:
  - Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.

- que:
  - There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I'll remember that. What do you do?
  ans:
  - I'm a housewife.

- que:
  - I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - Why do men chase women?
  ans:
  - Nerves.

- que:
  - May I walk with you a ways?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You knew that man?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I guess you can't invite me in?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You mean the whole house?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
  ans:
  - He's a plumber.

- que:
  - What? What?
  ans:
  - Look.

  - You see that moon last night?
  ans:
  - Burn her anyway.

  - Tell me ... what do you do with witches?
  ans:
  - Burn them.

- que:
  - And what do you burn, apart from witches?
  ans:
  - I see. Yes, of course.

- que:
  - So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
  ans:
  - Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ...

- que:
  - Does wood sink in water?
  ans:
  - No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her. To the pond.

- que:
  - Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
  ans:
  - Bread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...

- que:
  - Get away!
  ans:
  - Halt! Who goes there?

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.

- que:
  - Where did you get the coconuts?
  ans:
  - Well, this is a temperate zone.

- que:
  - Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
  ans:
  - Not at all. They could be carried.

- que:
  - What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
  ans:
  - Well, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

- que:
  - Am I right?
  ans:
  - I'm not interested.

- que:
  - And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
  ans:
  - There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.

- que:
  - But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
  ans:
  - Seek you the Bridge of Death ...

  - King of the WHO?

  - Who are the Britons?
  ans:
  - All of us are ... we are all Britons.

  - Please, please good people. I am in haste. What knight lives in that castle?
  ans:
  - No one live there.

- que:
  - Well, who is your lord?
  ans:
  - We don't have a lord.

- que:
  - You don't vote for kings.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Well, how did you become king, then?
  ans:
  - The same!

- que:
  - Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery. May we go now?
  ans:
  - That is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.

- que:
  - None shall pass.
  ans:
  - What is that?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - None shall pass.

- que:
  - Well, what's that then?
  ans:
  - I've had worse.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.

  - Had enough?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.

- que:
  - You didn't bother to find out, did you?
  ans:
  - I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - ... Well, we did do the nose.

- que:
  - The nose?
  ans:
  - And the hat. But she is a witch.

- que:
  - Why do you think she is a witch?
  ans:
  - Make a bridge out of her.

- que:
  - Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
  ans:
  - Exactly. So... logically ...

- que:
  - And therefore?
  ans:
  - Nothing... There's your ninepence.

- que:

  - Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
  ans:

  - They're doctors?
  ans:
  - No look, really, this isn't nescess ...

- que:
  - You've come to rescue me?
  ans:
  - Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...

- que:
  - What's he do? Nibble your bum?
  ans:
  - Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.

- que:
  - So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
  ans:
  - I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Seventy a year.

- que:
  - How about yourself?
  ans:
  - Sixty.

- que:
  - Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
  ans:
  - It's better than shovelling horse shit.

- que:
  - Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
  ans:
  - She loved him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean.

- que:
  - Which one of us is she flirting with?
  ans:
  - The good-looking one.

- que:
  - Aye, but will they?
  ans:
  - John, it's not your problem what she eats.

- que:
  - They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?
  ans:
  - It's a diary.

- que:
  - What do you take me for?
  ans:
  - You should have someone look after you.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Mary Taylor, sir.

- que:
  - Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
  ans:
  - I hope to go up next year.

- que:
  - You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
  ans:
  - Checked and locked, sir.

- que:
  - Good man. And is she all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you all right, Barney?
  ans:
  - Mr Disraeli. Ma'am.

- que:
  - Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in sugar...?
  ans:
  - I don't think I've had that pleasure.

- que:
  - A situation?
  ans:
  - I'm flattered you think so.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon? Mama...?
  ans:
  - I wish to see my mother.

- que:
  - Do you know who you address, sir?
  ans:
  - It's so infernally cold in here.

- que:
  - Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
  ans:
  - It is quite late enough.

- que:
  - By whose authority?
  ans:
  - My own.

- que:
  - How will I know what she requires?
  ans:
  - You'll be sent a message.

- que:
  - Who'll bring it to me?
  ans:
  - Her Highness' Equerry.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Yes. I do.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - I thought I made myself perfectly clear. You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.

- que:
  - It can wait. Anything else?
  ans:
  - A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen. It was remiss of me not to come earlier.

- que:
  - What do you know about the Highlands?
  ans:
  - I am a blank sheet.

- que:
  - Do you hunt?
  ans:
  - Occasionally.

- que:
  - Was there never ambition?
  ans:
  - Maybe, once.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.

- que:
  - But yourself? What about John Brown?
  ans:
  - I said. I serve the Queen.

- que:
  - No other aspiration?
  ans:
  - You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.

- que:
  - So...?
  ans:
  - Her mind is set. She won't change now.

- que:
  - See what?
  ans:
  - The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.

- que:
  - You are well?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - And the pony?
  ans:
  - She's well, too.

- que:
  - Then why do you persist in doing it?
  ans:
  - Aye, ma'am.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I am told so.

- que:
  - Who by?
  ans:
  - Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.

- que:
  - What does he know about the Highlands?
  ans:
  - He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.

- que:
  - What is it, John? John?
  ans:
  - I heard something.

- que:
  - Must they always follow us?
  ans:
  - I ordered it. It's for your own safety.

- que:
  - Am I not safe enough with you, John?
  ans:
  - Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.

- que:
  - Yes, ma'am?
  ans:
  - I was told you were in a fight.

- que:
  - Has someone seen to those bruises?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I do not accept.

- que:
  - What can we do?
  ans:
  - Oh, several things.

- que:
  - Is that not enough?
  ans:
  - In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave. A figurehead.

- que:
  - I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?
  ans:
  - No, ma'am.

- que:
  - The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
  ans:
  - Well, both.

- que:
  - My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
  ans:
  - The question is, do we need her?

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - We'll see which way the wind blows.

- que:
  - What did he want?
  ans:
  - To know when he'll be king.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Mrs Brown.

- que:
  - What's her excuse this time?
  ans:
  - The Princess Louisa is too ill to move. Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity. You're smiling.

- que:
  - We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where did you find it by the way?
  ans:
  - Some young page was boasting about having seen it. Lucky.

- que:
  - The same, your Majesty.
  ans:
  - Whom?

- que:
  - Why was I not informed?
  ans:
  - I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.

- que:
  - How ill is he?
  ans:
  - The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.

- que:
  - Just them?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - What is he doing there?
  ans:
  - He appears to be ... standing by his horse.

- que:
  - I made no request to go out riding today. How long has he been there?
  ans:
  - I don't know, ma'am. He was observed earlier, I believe.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

- que:
  - Unwell?
  ans:
  - I understand he was in a fight.

- que:
  - Has he been hurt?
  ans:
  - I believe not, ma'am. I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.

- que:
  - How long has he been this sick?
  ans:
  - A few days, ma'am.

- que:
  - Why was I not told earlier?
  ans:
  - Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.

- que:
  - Who told them that?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I have a letter, ma'am.

- que:
  - From whom?
  ans:
  - From Princess Helena and other members of your family.

- que:
  - What do they want?
  ans:
  - They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

- que:
  - Ma'am?
  ans:
  - Ma'am.

- que:
  - Where is my son?
  ans:
  - Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

- que:
  - Why is he not here?
  ans:
  - He is sick, ma'am.

- que:
  - Then why are you not with him?
  ans:
  - You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.

- que:
  - What is the matter with him?
  ans:
  - He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's a tough game. Hard to pin that bastard down. Keeps on changing the rules.

- que:
  - What's the riddle?
  ans:
  - If I tell you, then it's no fun.

- que:
  - Could you play ARCADE with that?
  ans:
  - Well, technically \"yes\", but this is only the prototype.

- que:
  - Thanks, Albert. Think you could print up those schematics?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What's the question mark?
  ans:
  - Level Ten. That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.

- que:
  - Dead?
  ans:
  - Well, brain-dead anyway. Coma patient. It's really not all that important.

- que:
  - He?
  ans:
  - The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game.

- que:
  - How'd you know it was us?
  ans:
  - Security camera. Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.

- que:
  - Now what seems to be the problem?
  ans:
  - It's the game, ARCADE.

- que:
  - You don't like it?
  ans:
  - If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.

- que:
  - Has anyone seen Greg?
  ans:
  - He's probably outside. You know how he is. Gets bored...

- que:
  - Sick?
  ans:
  - Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.

- que:
  - Did you play ARCADE last night?
  ans:
  - Actually, no. I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...

- que:
  - Liar. Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
  ans:
  - I came from the city on the left.

- que:
  - Hmmm. He said you were going to have dinner?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hey, kid.

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I have to talk to you.

- que:
  - What do you mean by \"weird\"?
  ans:
  - Greg never came home. A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.

- que:
  - Can you turn off the game?
  ans:
  - No. Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... I think the game's alive somehow.

- que:
  - So how did it know my name, then?
  ans:
  - You imagined it.

- que:
  - All of them?
  ans:
  - Because I didn't know where else to go.

- que:
  - It's not this weird. It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - She thought Benz was at school.

- que:
  - Where to now?
  ans:
  - Laurie's.

- que:
  - This is like a movie or something. I mean, am I paranoid or what?
  ans:
  - My house. I want to try something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.

- que:
  - Like the fractals?
  ans:
  - It's growing. Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You mean we learn the rules...

- que:
  - Virgin sacrifices?
  ans:
  - Drives 'em crazy every time.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Everything.

- que:
  - What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.

- que:
  - Okay. Give us a kiss?
  ans:
  - One. In case...

- que:
  - Which way do you think Level Two is?
  ans:
  - I don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - I just thought of something. If we came back from the game... ...what if ARCADE did too?
  ans:
  - I know.

- que:
  - And then keep on driving?
  ans:
  - Sure. Never come back. Disappear forever.

- que:
  - So how did you do it, Alex?
  ans:
  - Well, it's a long story...

- que:
  - Then we'll go home?
  ans:
  - Then we'll go home.

- que:
  - Which way?
  ans:
  - That way.

- que:
  - I miss you so much, Alex. I want so much to be with you...
  ans:
  - What did he do to you?

- que:
  - I love you, Alex. I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes...but...how did you...

- que:
  - Is...is that where we are? Did I die?
  ans:
  - Not yet, honey...

- que:
  - \"Escape\"?
  ans:
  - In case things get too intense. It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather. Things can get pretty wild...

- que:
  - So how do I start?
  ans:
  - The game will guide you.

- que:
  - So what do you think?
  ans:
  - Sign me up.

- que:
  - Can you say anything but \"cool\"?
  ans:
  - Of course I can. I can say all sorts of things...

- que:
  - I am the Truth Teller. Where should I take you?
  ans:
  - So start at the beginning...

- que:
  - What's going on, Cynthia?
  ans:
  - They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - They fired everyone.

- que:
  - What do you mean \"you know\"?
  ans:
  - Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.

- que:
  - But I'm not broke.
  ans:
  - And?

- que:
  - I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
  ans:
  - Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.

- que:
  - The Cowboy?
  ans:
  - Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

- que:
  - Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
  ans:
  - Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.

- que:
  - Cynthia...what's going on?
  ans:
  - It's been a very strange day.

- que:
  - And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
  ans:
  - Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.

- que:
  - Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
  ans:
  - I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.

- que:
  - So what's the problem?
  ans:
  - There is no problem.

- que:
  - Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
  ans:
  - Whatever.

- que:
  - A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What did I say?
  ans:
  - That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

- que:
  - Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
  ans:
  - Okay, I'm thinking.

- que:
  - There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
  ans:
  - One.

- que:
  - Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
  ans:
  - I understand.

- que:
  - So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
  ans:
  - No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.

- que:
  - Yes...what is it?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.

- que:
  - ... What?
  ans:
  - The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.

- que:
  - How... how'd they know I was here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.

- que:
  - So, what did they say?
  ans:
  - Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.

- que:
  - Unbelievable. Look... here. I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
  ans:
  - That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.

- que:
  - It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
  ans:
  - His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.

- que:
  - I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - A car ... a car accident.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I think so. I was just taking a shower.

- que:
  - Betty Elms?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
  ans:
  - No, no, I'm fine.

- que:
  - I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
  ans:
  - Betty.

- que:
  - You're still here?
  ans:
  - I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

- que:
  - Before what?
  ans:
  - Yes, there was.

- que:
  - Can you tell me what happened?
  ans:
  - No. I can't.

- que:
  - Diane?
  ans:
  - Number 17.

- que:
  - What is it Rita?
  ans:
  - I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...

- que:
  - How do you remember how to talk?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You don't remember anything else?
  ans:
  - No There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it. There are things there.... but I'm... here.

- que:
  - The money. You don't know where it came from?
  ans:
  - Unh, unh.

- que:
  - When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
  ans:
  - Mulholland Drive.

- que:
  - Mulholland Drive?
  ans:
  - That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.

- que:
  - There's nothing?
  ans:
  - Not that I can see.

- que:
  - What's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - I'm all right.

- que:
  - To my audition.
  ans:
  - Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?

- que:
  - And who are we auditioning for today?
  ans:
  - Wally Brown.

- que:
  - And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
  ans:
  - No, we don't.

- que:
  - Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
  ans:
  - Yes, Sir.

- que:
  - Yeah, what for?
  ans:
  - Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.

- que:
  - What's the matter now?
  ans:
  - Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.

- que:
  - Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to come here.

- que:
  - To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
  ans:
  - This Denny's.

- que:
  - Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
  ans:
  - Okay. Why this Denny's?

- que:
  - So, you came to see if he's out there?
  ans:
  - To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

- que:
  - MCKNIGHT You feel it?
  ans:
  - DOMGAARD Yeah.

- que:
  - MCKNIGHT Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
  ans:
  - DOMGAARD No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

- que:
  - MCKNIGHT The one of 'em still alive?
  ans:
  - DOMGAARD Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.

- que:
  - MCKNIGHT Find out who they are?
  ans:
  - DOMGAARD Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.

- que:
  - MCKNIGHT Where at?
  ans:
  - DOMGAARD Palmdale.

- que:
  - Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
  ans:
  - Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.

- que:
  - Not a coke or anything?
  ans:
  - No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.

- que:
  - A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
  ans:
  - Where's the dock ?

- que:
  - Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
  ans:
  - Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?

- que:
  - Is that it ?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'd say that's it.

- que:
  - Good morning. What do you have today ?
  ans:
  - I have an embezzler and his accomplice.

- que:
  - What's going on ?
  ans:
  - Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.

- que:
  - Where are we ?
  ans:
  - No time. Get him up.

- que:
  - Why should we trust you ?
  ans:
  - I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....

- que:
  - What about Matt ?
  ans:
  - You're both embezzling. I saw the records.

- que:
  - Now where do we go ?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How do we get out of this room ?
  ans:
  - We wait. This is an elevator.

- que:
  - Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
  ans:
  - We have to climb up that.

- que:
  - So where does this lead ?
  ans:
  - No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.

- que:
  - So what do we do ?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it.

- que:
  - Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
  ans:
  - It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.

- que:
  - First Bank ? But how ?
  ans:
  - It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.

- que:
  - McCay knows ?
  ans:
  - Knows ? He watches every \"Guest\" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.

- que:
  - What are you doing ?
  ans:
  - NO ! I wouldn't do that.

- que:
  - Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
  ans:
  - Why would he ? His parents are rich.

- que:
  - What's the trick here ?
  ans:
  - We drown.

- que:
  - Obviously, but what's the way out ?
  ans:
  - Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.

- que:
  - How long till the room fills ?
  ans:
  - I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.

- que:
  - Do you have something better to talk about ?
  ans:
  - I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.

- que:
  - But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
  ans:
  - I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.

- que:
  - There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
  ans:
  - Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.

- que:
  - What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
  ans:
  - I... I .....

- que:
  - Know what ? That it was your fault ?
  ans:
  - It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...

- que:
  - You okay ?
  ans:
  - Fine...

- que:
  - Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
  ans:
  - You don't. It's random, there no trick.

- que:
  - Where are we going ?
  ans:
  - The Brooklyn Bridge.

- que:
  - Do you know where you're going ?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What was that ?
  ans:
  - Girder, watch your head.

- que:
  - What about you ?
  ans:
  - There's one more person here for me to visit.

- que:
  - I work here, remember ?
  ans:
  - That was eleven years ago.

- que:
  - Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
  ans:
  - That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.

- que:
  - Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
  ans:
  - Just shut the fuck up.

- que:
  - Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
  ans:
  - Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.

- que:
  - I don't help criminals.
  ans:
  - And that's different than this because...... ?

- que:
  - Is it over ?
  ans:
  - Not quite....

- que:
  - What's next Walt ?
  ans:
  - A dragon.

- que:
  - So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
  ans:
  - Be very, very quiet...

- que:
  - Are you hunting wabbits ?
  ans:
  - The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.

- que:
  - An elevator ?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.

- que:
  - Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
  ans:
  - Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.

- que:
  - You okay ?
  ans:
  - Ow...

- que:
  - This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
  ans:
  - Knock yourself out.

- que:
  - Is it over ?
  ans:
  - Almost. Look, you two get out of here.

- que:
  - Where ?
  ans:
  - In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.

- que:
  - What ?
  ans:
  - Don't eat at the console.

- que:
  - What ? Are you my mother ?
  ans:
  - It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.

- que:
  - Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
  ans:
  - When I think you're ready.

- que:
  - When will that be ?
  ans:
  - When you are ready.

- que:
  - I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
  ans:
  - You did.

- que:
  - What's wrong ?
  ans:
  - I just want to double check the facts.

- que:
  - So ?
  ans:
  - He already had a balance of $600,000.

- que:
  - Any priors ? Any police record ?
  ans:
  - Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...

- que:
  - Parking tickets ? That's it ?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but we're talking 43.

- que:
  - A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
  ans:
  - Checking........

- que:
  - You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
  ans:
  - For once in your life, shut the fuck up.

- que:
  - Well ?
  ans:
  - MCCAY Fire the whole division.

- que:
  - Excuse me, sir ?
  ans:
  - Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....

- que:
  - MCCAY If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
  ans:
  - We will start work on it now sir.

- que:
  - I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
  ans:
  - Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.

- que:
  - Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
  ans:
  - MCCAY Of course.

- que:
  - MCCAY Zach, how old are you, son ?
  ans:
  - I am thirty two.

- que:
  - MCCAY And how much do we pay you annually ?
  ans:
  - I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.

- que:
  - MCCAY What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the \"Park\" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
  ans:
  - Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.

- que:
  - MCCAY I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
  ans:
  - What do you mean sir ?

- que:
  - What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
  ans:
  - MCCAY Do you think the assistant, what's his name...

- que:
  - MCCAY Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
  ans:
  - Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.

- que:
  - MCCAY Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
  ans:
  - Good, sir.

- que:
  - MCCAY Is it as good as I hope it is ?
  ans:
  - Better, sir.

- que:
  - Sir ?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.

- que:
  - We have new \"guests\" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
  ans:
  - He's been expecting you.

- que:
  - What did you hear ?
  ans:
  - I was.

- que:
  - Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
  ans:
  - There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.

- que:
  - What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
  ans:
  - No. I am not a homosexual.

- que:
  - Then what do you want ?
  ans:
  - Have you ever considered running your own \"Park\" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.

- que:
  - Are you happy with your salary and position ?
  ans:
  - No I am not.

- que:
  - So who are these people with the Boss ?
  ans:
  - Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.

- que:
  - How long till the drug wears off ?
  ans:
  - We should have another fifteen minutes at least.

- que:
  - What is Bruce doing ?
  ans:
  - I don't know.....

- que:
  - He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
  ans:
  - What was that ?

- que:
  - Will he make it out ?
  ans:
  - Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.

- que:
  - I'll see that bet.
  ans:
  - What's next ?

- que:
  - Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
  ans:
  - Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....

- que:
  - Was that the Old Man ?
  ans:
  - The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.

- que:
  - What happened ?
  ans:
  - The power went out in half the park.

- que:
  - How can this happen ?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.

- que:
  - I meant him.
  ans:
  - Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?

- que:
  - Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
  ans:

  - Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
  ans:
  - ehh...I don't know I mean....

- que:
  - Then what did she do?
  ans:
  - Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.

- que:
  - So she had you in jail, in Russia?
  ans:
  - Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.

- que:
  - Is it okay if I drink this?
  ans:
  - It's okay with me, hi Kevin.

- que:
  - You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
  ans:
  - No-one invented gravity, it just exists.

- que:
  - All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.

- que:
  - Nicholas! What are you doing up?
  ans:
  - I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.

- que:
  - And you're gonna solve the mystery?
  ans:
  - You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.

- que:
  - WHAT?
  ans:
  - Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.

- que:
  - What difference does it make?
  ans:
  - A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.

- que:
  - Get married?
  ans:
  - Change my name.

- que:
  - What, you think the guy should change his name?
  ans:
  - I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.

- que:
  - Why do you argue with everything I say?
  ans:
  - You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.

- que:
  - Care for a smoke?
  ans:
  - This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.

- que:
  - Does it work?
  ans:
  - Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

- que:
  - Boyfriend?
  ans:
  - Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.

- que:
  - Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
  ans:
  - Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.

- que:
  - What do you mean Uh Oh?
  ans:
  - ...I dropped it.

- que:
  - In the tar?
  ans:
  - It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Owh...

- que:
  - Right.
  ans:
  - What's he smoking?

- que:
  - And you'd be my cousin?
  ans:
  - Yeah I guess...sort of.

- que:
  - But we wouldn't really be related right?
  ans:
  - Good. I mean...

- que:
  - Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
  ans:
  - I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - This has been a real confusing day.

- que:
  - You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
  ans:

  - Have you ever tried any?
  ans:
  - No.

  ans:
  - Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.

  - Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.

- que:
  - If I do it, can we go?

  - What's wrong with your eyes?
  ans:
  - A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

  ans:
  - Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You have no personality.

- que:
  - Hey, where does it say that?
  ans:
  - Never mind.

  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who's that with your Dad?
  ans:
  - It's my mother.

- que:
  - Do you remember her?
  ans:
  - No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Heaven.

- que:
  - But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
  ans:
  - You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.

  - So?
  ans:
  - Stand back.

  - For their meat.

  - Hi, wanna ride bikes?
  ans:
  - Sure.

  ans:
  - No, I'm hiding out.

- que:
  - Hi Vada, can you come out?
  ans:
  - I dunno..

- que:
  - Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
  ans:
  - Well when you get older, you just have to.

- que:
  - Like they do on TV?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Like this?
  ans:
  - Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

- que:
  - And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.

- que:
  - Stay, huh?
  ans:
  - I honestly wish I could...

- que:
  - Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
  ans:
  - If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.

- que:
  - Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
  ans:
  - I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

- que:
  - There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
  ans:
  - Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?

- que:
  - You've been working on this, huh?
  ans:
  - I wish.

- que:
  - Neosporin?
  ans:
  - Try less appropriate.

- que:
  - I can't even say it.
  ans:
  - Elmer's Glue?

- que:
  - What do you suggest?
  ans:
  - I suppose it's too late to start over.

- que:
  - You're going to say it, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Tell him you love him. With all your heart.

- que:
  - And what will he do?
  ans:
  - Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning. Brevity is even more in order than usual.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I can be quick. I can even be funny.

- que:
  - Can you watch the road?
  ans:
  - The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt.

- que:
  - So your honeymoon is exactly where?
  ans:
  - It depends. If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix. Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...

- que:
  - ... his snoring, yeah. He says it's worse than ever. That snaffle one...?
  ans:
  - How about...

- que:
  - Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
  ans:
  - So it's sweet of you to be protective...

- que:
  - Exactly what?
  ans:
  - What you said. Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.

- que:
  - He won't get mad, huh?
  ans:
  - Your call. You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns. Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...

- que:
  - Uh, Kimmy...?
  ans:
  - We settled this. And I reneged. That wasn't fair.

- que:
  - Who? The jerk who's running your life?
  ans:
  - This must be... very, very, hard on him.

- que:
  - When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
  ans:
  - Don't you see...

- que:
  - ... that this is all my fault?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...

- que:
  - Have you ever heard of. Irony?
  ans:
  - I never want to go through this again.

- que:
  - It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
  ans:
  - Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey. Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.

- que:
  - Ex-cuse me?
  ans:
  - I had this crank call? From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...

- que:
  - You are <u<so right. What a nerve on that guy! Bring my dress to church, huh?
  ans:
  - If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.

- que:
  - Is anybody watching?
  ans:
  - I hope so. This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.

- que:
  - Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
  ans:
  - It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.

- que:
  - I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
  ans:
  - Nobody has. So far.

- que:
  - Best everything, Joe. But I'm going to dance with you.
  ans:
  - I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?

- que:
  - Dance? You don't dance! You learn to dance?
  ans:
  - ... see, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.

- que:
  - What's next?
  ans:
  - Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...

- que:
  - Where was that, Florence, huh?
  ans:
  - Firenze.

- que:
  - The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
  ans:
  - Till the gas ran out.

- que:
  - Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm cheap, remember?
  ans:
  - Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.

- que:
  - Wow and wow. You have a date, after this?
  ans:
  - Never can tell.

- que:
  - You miss her, huh?
  ans:
  - No. I've got you.

- que:
  - Don't you throw up on boat?
  ans:
  - If you like.

- que:
  - And I was thinking this could be our last time. Alone. Together. You know?
  ans:
  - Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.

- que:
  - Dance card filled?
  ans:
  - I'll check. I have it on powerbook, these days.

- que:
  - Will she like it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
  ans:
  - It's over.

- que:
  - I just want to be alone. Is that okay?
  ans:
  - Get married, apparently.

- que:
  - And your point?
  ans:
  - Well. How come she didn't...

- que:
  - ... your one chance for true happiness?
  ans:
  - ... yeah, that.

- que:
  - The Big Hurt, huh?
  ans:
  - Nellie Fox. Walter likes the past. And he likes the little guys.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Shhh.

- que:
  - I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
  ans:
  - I didn't know it would get sent. I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...

- que:
  - It's not just a gag, huh?
  ans:
  - No, it's, uh... a real big favor.

- que:
  - Like family, huh?
  ans:
  - It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...

- que:
  - Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
  ans:
  - He said you told him. It'd be safer with you.

- que:
  - You got the money?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - What do you have to buy?
  ans:
  - Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.

- que:
  - Come on.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - You're from out of town?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm cutting a record.

- que:
  - Is there food?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You have to what?
  ans:
  - Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.

- que:
  - Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
  ans:
  - All those people...

- que:
  - Am I disturbing you?
  ans:
  - I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.

- que:
  - How did you come in here?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.

- que:
  - What did you say your name was?
  ans:
  - Green.

- que:
  - You going today?
  ans:
  - Thank you-- Yes, I am.

- que:
  - What do you really want?
  ans:
  - Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.

- que:
  - Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
  ans:
  - She's fine.

- que:
  - How is that?
  ans:
  - Everybody likes to be as good as their word.

- que:
  - Whose word?
  ans:
  - His Word.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They can come to the concert in the park.

- que:
  - No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
  ans:
  - Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - A little slow, but she'll be fine.

- que:
  - Who the hell is he?
  ans:
  - He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.

- que:
  - Who the hell is he?
  ans:
  - He's going to run for president.

- que:
  - Third party?
  ans:
  - He has that sign with the tree.

- que:
  - What does he want?
  ans:
  - Barbara Jean.

  ans:
  - Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

  - Whose?
  ans:
  - Hal Phillip Walker.

- que:
  - What's he running for?
  ans:
  - President.

  ans:
  - ABC.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Minimum.

- que:
  - D.C.? Tammany Hall? He came there?
  ans:
  - It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Yes, but we're just singing.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To the bathroom.

- que:
  - National?
  ans:
  - Yes. Percy Warner Park'.

- que:
  - What crook?
  ans:
  - He saw us at Tammany Hall.

- que:
  - Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Let me know when you do, all right?
  ans:
  - You bet.

- que:
  - Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
  ans:
  - He got killed at a turkey shoot.

- que:
  - Your brother?
  ans:
  - Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.

  - Harvard?
  ans:
  - Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.

- que:
  - Do you know Barbara Jean?
  ans:
  - Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.

- que:
  - I'm fine. Can I go up?
  ans:
  - Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.

- que:
  - You want me to wait?
  ans:
  - No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your wire Ester - she passed away.

- que:
  - She sure sings nice.
  ans:
  - Can I help you?

- que:
  - A little. What do you need?
  ans:
  - Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.

- que:
  - You know anything about the stations here?
  ans:
  - It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I said, maybe I'll change my name again.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Replacement party.

  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.

  ans:
  - How do you know?

  ans:
  - I don't think so.

  - When did you start singing?
  ans:

  - Well, can you tell me why?
  ans:
  - It just is.

- que:
  - How long have you been with them?
  ans:
  - About three years.

- que:
  - And before?
  ans:

- que:
  - Do you ever do any writing?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - Do you like him?
  ans:
  - He's a member of our congregation.

  - Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
  ans:
  - Yes.

  - Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
  ans:
  - I'd really like to see you.

- que:
  - Well...How have you been?
  ans:
  - Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.

- que:
  - Who is thin?
  ans:
  - Who is this, right? I called you last night.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.

  - Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...? Courtland wants to...

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.

  - Mary?
  ans:
  - We just got a gold record.

- que:
  - Do they have a show to give it to you?
  ans:
  - No Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.

- que:
  - Did it break?
  ans:
  - Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.

- que:
  - How long have you been together?
  ans:
  - Probably a little too long.

- que:
  - Do you study at all?
  ans:
  - Depends on what I'm studying.

- que:
  - Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Come on.

  - Why?
  ans:
  - Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.

- que:
  - Oh --
  ans:
  - Well, I really think he's got a chance.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.

- que:
  - Where are you from?
  ans:
  - Southern California.

- que:
  - Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
  ans:
  - I know a couple.

- que:
  - No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
  ans:
  - Ah... Peter Finch.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Peter Finch -- he's English.

- que:
  - You really do? ~ God -- How come you know them?
  ans:
  - Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.

  ans:
  - Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.

- que:
  - You want a ride into town?
  ans:
  - You bet.

- que:
  - You think I got any kind of a voice?
  ans:
  - You sure do it loud.

- que:
  - Is that good?
  ans:
  - It's not bad.

- que:
  - You think I should take lessons?
  ans:
  - If you're serious. Being serious is real important.

- que:
  - You serious?
  ans:
  - Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.

- que:
  - You think it will?
  ans:
  - Sure thing.

- que:
  - May I see your costume?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
  ans:
  - Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.

- que:
  - What was the color of Tim's belt?
  ans:
  - The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.

- que:
  - Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
  ans:
  - Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

- que:
  - Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
  ans:
  - Yes, they were.

- que:
  - That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
  ans:
  - Yes, you are.

- que:
  - What kind of pies do you have?
  ans:
  - Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

- que:
  - Which do you recommend?
  ans:
  - The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.

- que:
  - What did you think then?
  ans:
  - I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.

- que:
  - Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
  ans:
  - Try to keep it to a minimum.

- que:
  - You got something you want to do?
  ans:
  - We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.

- que:
  - Who is we?
  ans:
  - The prison board and the doctors who examined them.

- que:
  - Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
  ans:
  - Using the same doctors is not common practice.

- que:
  - I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
  ans:
  - Thank you, sir.

- que:
  - I can appreciate that.
  ans:
  - Who isn't?

- que:
  - The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
  ans:
  - By all means.

- que:
  - Who's the song bird?
  ans:
  - Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.

- que:
  - How's it goin'?
  ans:
  - She's in the holding cell, on this floor.

- que:
  - How come you never talk?
  ans:
  - She was born without a tongue.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

- que:
  - How is it?
  ans:
  - Ready.

- que:
  - Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Whose ratings were higher?
  ans:
  - Yours.

- que:
  - How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
  ans:
  - Manson beat you.

- que:
  - She doesn't talk?
  ans:
  - Not to anybody. She sings.

- que:
  - Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
  ans:
  - I'm keen with anticipation.

- que:
  - We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
  ans:
  - Let's do it.

- que:
  - Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
  ans:
  - What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.

- que:
  - Do you miss Mallory?
  ans:
  - Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.

- que:
  - Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
  ans:
  - Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

- que:
  - Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
  ans:
  - That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.

- que:
  - You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
  ans:
  - Tell me about the purity.

- que:
  - Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. What's up here? What's in here?
  ans:
  - That's indescribable.

- que:
  - Says who?
  ans:
  - Says the United States of America.

- que:
  - When have they ever been right?
  ans:
  - Okay, let's cut it.

- que:
  - You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Where's it parked?
  ans:
  - Out front.

- que:
  - Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...

- que:
  - So, what now?
  ans:
  - Just wait one fucking minute.

- que:
  - ...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
  ans:
  - No. Not really.

- que:
  - Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
  ans:
  - They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.

- que:
  - And they made the first move?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately, yes.

- que:
  - Where do the air ducts lead?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
  ans:
  - It's hard to say Capt'n.

- que:
  - The entire wing?
  ans:
  - That's my opinion.

- que:
  - How immediate is immediately?
  ans:
  - Next week's episode.

- que:
  - You can't be serious?
  ans:
  - Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

- que:
  - So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
  ans:
  - Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

- que:
  - Scotty?
  ans:
  - Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.

- que:
  - And where do you keep Mickey?
  ans:
  - We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Two-thirty. Shhh...

- que:
  - Are you all set?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.

- que:
  - They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
  ans:
  - Waitin' in the lounge.

- que:
  - How 'bout Mallory?
  ans:
  - Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

- que:
  - Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - When do you want the assembly?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow.

- que:
  - It's gonna be beautiful.
  ans:
  - How's it working, Scotty?

- que:
  - But how can you say that?
  ans:
  - They're mesmerising.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - They passed the 'edge' along to us.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - But you'll never be whole again.

- que:
  - Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
  ans:
  - I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.

- que:
  - How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
  ans:
  - Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.

- que:
  - You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

- que:
  - Is that her real name?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.

- que:
  - See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It sure is.

- que:
  - Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
  ans:
  - Lose 'em.

- que:
  - Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
  ans:
  - Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

- que:
  - Two guys?
  ans:
  - Okay. I'll take two guys off.

- que:
  - Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
  ans:
  - Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.

- que:
  - How 'bout that furniture plant?
  ans:
  - Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.

- que:
  - Where' you goin'?
  ans:
  - Out.

- que:
  - Want me to come?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
  ans:
  - It sure is.

- que:
  - You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
  ans:
  - See Duff. He's the money man.

- que:
  - What d'you say, Duff?
  ans:
  - You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.

- que:
  - You think so, Frankie?
  ans:
  - Hell, you got steady work.

- que:
  - Fill her up?
  ans:
  - No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.

- que:
  - Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
  ans:
  - That'll be thirty-eight cents.

- que:
  - That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
  ans:
  - You in a big hurry, boy?

- que:
  - You Duff Anderson?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - You a union man?
  ans:
  - Used to be. On the railroad.

- que:
  - All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?

- que:
  - What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
  ans:
  - I'll smile when it's funny.

- que:
  - Where was that?
  ans:
  - Walker and Williams.

- que:
  - What did you say your name is?
  ans:
  - Anderson.

- que:
  - What d'you want?
  ans:
  - Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.

- que:
  - Where's Wilma?
  ans:
  - She done moved to Detroit.

- que:
  - Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
  ans:
  - She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.

- que:
  - Like where?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He's your boy.

- que:
  - Where's he at?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How 'you doing?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Don't say much, do you?
  ans:
  - Guess I don't.

- que:
  - Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Guess so.

- que:
  - Have anything in mind?
  ans:
  - No. What you usually say, I guess.

- que:
  - Where was your father born?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - His profession?
  ans:
  - Well, he worked around.

- que:
  - And his age?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.

- que:
  - Any other family?
  ans:
  - No. Just me. Me an' her.

- que:
  - That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
  ans:
  - You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.

- que:
  - How 'you doin' man?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.

- que:
  - Been over to the other mill?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I been there.

- que:
  - Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
  ans:
  - Okay, I will.

- que:
  - Haven't seen you around, have I?
  ans:
  - No. I'm new in town.

- que:
  - You working?
  ans:
  - Yeah. On the section gang.

- que:
  - You work around town?
  ans:
  - I'm a teacher.

- que:
  - Went to college, huh?
  ans:
  - In Birmingham.

- que:
  - No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
  ans:
  - My father's the preacher.

- que:
  - Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What d'you expect?
  ans:
  - You know, baby, I can't figure you out.

- que:
  - Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't think much of yourself, do you?
  ans:
  - Well, that's a funny thing to say.

- que:
  - How about another beer?
  ans:
  - They must work on the section gang.

- que:
  - I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
  ans:
  - That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.

- que:
  - How d'you mean?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't get on so well most places.

- que:
  - How come you stay 'round here?
  ans:
  - Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.

- que:
  - That's why you come back, huh?
  ans:
  - It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.

- que:
  - Scared, huh?
  ans:
  - Not here, Duff.

- que:
  - What d'you mean?
  ans:
  - You almost got into trouble back there.

- que:
  - Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
  ans:
  - No, on the porch.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.

- que:
  - All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
  ans:
  - Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.

- que:
  - Why did you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.

- que:
  - Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What d'you mean?
  ans:
  - Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.

- que:
  - Just for the day?
  ans:
  - Goin' to see my kid.

- que:
  - Are you married?
  ans:
  - No, I ain't married. Well, good-bye.

- que:
  - Surprised?
  ans:
  - No. Women're always followin' me 'round.

- que:
  - How old is your boy?
  ans:
  - Four.

- que:
  - What's he like?
  ans:
  - I ain't seen him in a couple of years.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your boy.

- que:
  - What d'you mean?
  ans:
  - Just what I said. Don't look so scared.

- que:
  - Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
  ans:
  - Don't push me, Duff.

- que:
  - She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over. Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
  ans:
  - No. But a small one.

- que:
  - It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
  ans:
  - It'll be fine when we get done with it.

- que:
  - Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
  ans:
  - Don't call them that.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - He could live with us.

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's so.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Hmmm - good coffee.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. Why?
  ans:
  - My kids want me to teach them.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Don't look so scared.

- que:
  - You jivin' me?
  ans:
  - Well, I haven't come around.

- que:
  - How come you keep askin'?
  ans:
  - I keep thinking about him.

- que:
  - Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.

- que:
  - Don't ask, baby - huh! How much money you got with you?
  ans:
  - About ten dollars.

- que:
  - What the hell could you do?
  ans:
  - Day work.

- que:
  - How come you don't hate their guts?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.

- que:
  - Ain't you goin' to say something?
  ans:
  - There's nothing to say.

- que:
  - Where're you going to go?
  ans:
  - When I get set, I'll send for you.

- que:
  - Where' you goin'?
  ans:
  - Round town.

- que:
  - What's so hot 'round town?
  ans:
  - Take it easy, Frankie.

- que:
  - How 'bout the key?
  ans:
  - I bet she's easy jam.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like a home, for one thing.

- que:
  - What 'you signifyin'?
  ans:
  - I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.

- que:
  - What's eatin' you, Jocko?
  ans:
  - Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.

- que:
  - Who're you?
  ans:
  - I'm Duff.

- que:
  - What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Heard you were in town.

- que:
  - Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. That's right.

- que:
  - How about a drink?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Workin' a saw mill. Here's to.

- que:
  - Plannin' on getting married?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - How you doin', boy?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Want me to hold the light for you?
  ans:
  - No, thanks.

- que:
  - Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
  ans:
  - Whenever he's got an edge on.

- que:
  - How often is that?
  ans:
  - He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.

- que:
  - Come back some other time, will you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure. Good luck.

- que:
  - Well, what're you going to do?
  ans:
  - I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.

- que:
  - Going back, huh?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - How 'you gonna live?
  ans:
  - I can always chop cotton if I have to. If you want a ride, I'll take you home.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - All right, son.

- que:
  - How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
  ans:
  - Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.

- que:
  - Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I guess I ain't.

- que:
  - Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
  ans:
  - Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.

- que:
  - You'll be in trouble, son. Now just how do you intend to support your family?
  ans:
  - I guess I'll rob a bank.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - I'll be seeing you.

- que:
  - Why don't you guys buy your own?
  ans:
  - Musta knocked her up.

- que:
  - What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
  ans:
  - Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.

- que:
  - I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
  ans:
  - Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.

- que:
  - What d'you know about women, Pop?
  ans:
  - Well, I got married to one of them.

- que:
  - Is that right? Think you're gonna make it with her?
  ans:
  - I understand.

- que:
  - No. Why?
  ans:
  - Let's stay here, Will.

- que:
  - Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
  ans:
  - Shut up, Will.

- que:
  - Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
  ans:
  - If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.

- que:
  - Better now. Where 'you at?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - Whoa. No way. You can't enter the kill zone.
  ans:
  - You hate Raoul?

- que:
  - Since when?
  ans:
  - Since you got married. You got someone else to think about now, Danny.

- que:
  - How long's it been?
  ans:
  - I'm still on my honeymoon.

- que:
  - We got any shots?
  ans:
  - Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.

- que:
  - Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
  ans:
  - No. I only needed the code from you.

- que:
  - She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
  ans:
  - She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - Of course...

- que:
  - What are you doing in here?
  ans:
  - The Elders, mon...

- que:
  - Can you get us into Straylight?
  ans:
  - Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.

- que:
  - I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
  ans:
  - Straylight. Kitchen dock.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.

- que:
  - What you lookin' for, mon?
  ans:
  - A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.

- que:
  - A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
  ans:
  - He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.

- que:
  - How's the villa's security?
  ans:
  - Alright. Let's talk business.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I was set up. She looked at least eighteen.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.

- que:
  - And how do you suggest I do that?
  ans:
  - Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.

- que:
  - What does this have to do with me?
  ans:
  - Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.

- que:
  - What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
  ans:
  - I'd say you were full of shit.

- que:
  - It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies. Terms?
  ans:
  - We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.

- que:
  - Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
  ans:
  - Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.

- que:
  - Why'd you do it, Armitage?
  ans:
  - The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.

- que:
  - And then?
  ans:
  - Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Could be your A.I.'s calling card.

- que:
  - Did you trace it?
  ans:
  - No, but it traced me.

- que:
  - He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
  ans:
  - Prepping your trip.

- que:
  - Linked?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well it's working.

- que:
  - You see the couple up in the balcony?
  ans:
  - That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.

- que:
  - The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
  ans:
  - That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.

- que:
  - Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
  ans:
  - As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.

- que:
  - Can you read my mind?
  ans:
  - I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.

- que:
  - Are you even really alive?
  ans:
  - My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.

- que:
  - The words?
  ans:
  - The access code to your mainframe.

- que:
  - What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
  ans:
  - Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.

- que:
  - Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
  ans:
  - Fine, Ratz. Thanks.

- que:
  - No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
  ans:
  - Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.

- que:
  - Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
  ans:
  - Fine, Dixie. Fine.

- que:
  - That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
  ans:
  - Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...

- que:
  - Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
  ans:
  - Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.

- que:
  - What elders?
  ans:
  - Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.

- que:
  - Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
  ans:
  - All things possible in Babylon.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.

- que:
  - Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
  ans:
  - Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.

- que:
  - What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
  ans:
  - Right...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.

- que:
  - Who got you into this?
  ans:
  - A guy who calls himself Armitage.

- que:
  - I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
  ans:
  - No problem, amigo.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.

- que:
  - How are we doing?
  ans:
  - That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.

- que:
  - Can you take me to it?
  ans:
  - Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.

- que:
  - It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
  ans:
  - Bright enough to be dangerous.

- que:
  - The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
  ans:
  - I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.

- que:
  - Where the hell have you been?
  ans:
  - We got problems topside.

- que:
  - We run. You crack the pattern?
  ans:
  - You can make your move when it comes after me.

- que:
  - What are you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.

- que:
  - Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
  ans:
  - Yo.

- que:
  - How's the ice break?
  ans:
  - Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.

- que:
  - How long, Dixie?
  ans:
  - Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.

- que:
  - How much time you got left?
  ans:
  - Less than thirty minutes.

- que:
  - One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
  ans:
  - It's coming.

- que:
  - You haven't got it?
  ans:
  - I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.

- que:
  - What about the route to the core?
  ans:
  - I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.

- que:
  - What about the mainframe's access code?
  ans:
  - 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The angels... I think they're calling your name.

- que:
  - Want to fucking answer them?
  ans:
  - No!... No...

- que:
  - Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
  ans:
  - People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.

- que:
  - Where did you here that?
  ans:
  - Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case. I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.

- que:
  - Case... are you okay?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't know...

- que:
  - Why would you want me to kill you?
  ans:
  - Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.

- que:
  - What's my end?
  ans:
  - You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.

- que:
  - Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
  ans:
  - Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.

- que:
  - He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
  ans:
  - Couple of months.

- que:
  - What about before that?
  ans:
  - For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.

- que:
  - Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
  ans:
  - I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - You've been calling her name.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Holy shit...

- que:
  - How long have I been out?
  ans:
  - Almost two days.

- que:
  - How soon is soon enough?
  ans:
  - Couple of days. They'll examine you.

- que:
  - What the fuck... are you serious?
  ans:
  - Go ahead...

- que:
  - Too late?
  ans:
  - Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.

- que:
  - Won't that mean you're dead?
  ans:
  - Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - ...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.

- que:
  - I don't sleep much. You packed?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's wrong? Don't like flying?
  ans:
  - Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.

- que:
  - Case... Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.

- que:
  - So... did you get a look at heaven?
  ans:
  - Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.

- que:
  - What went down between you and Riviera?
  ans:
  - I know you have. C'mere.

- que:
  - When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - No. It's important to be able to feel those things. We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.

- que:
  - Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
  ans:
  - The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.

- que:
  - ...And if I guess wrong?
  ans:
  - Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.

- que:
  - Peter... What do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.

- que:
  - What the fuck kind of questions are those?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - How long will they watch us for?
  ans:
  - Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.

- que:
  - Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Let's do that.

- que:
  - So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
  ans:
  - Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.

- que:
  - Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
  ans:
  - Petty good.

- que:
  - What is with this school and prom?
  ans:
  - That's the old drive-in. They call it \"The Court\". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.

- que:
  - Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - Yes, it's lame.

- que:
  - Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - I'm late for lab.
  ans:
  - Hey, where's your sweatshirt?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Last night. 7,30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.

- que:
  - Oh, man! Who told?
  ans:
  - Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.

- que:
  - Gus, have you ever been in love?
  ans:
  - Leave.

- que:
  - No Roger from op/ed?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
  ans:
  - Well. I like a man who gets to the point.

- que:
  - You're Pam?
  ans:
  - If you say so.

- que:
  - What about the \"Roaring Twenties\" or \"The 80's\"?
  ans:
  - Guess who I did it with last night...

- que:
  - Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
  ans:
  - Senorita Josie.

- que:
  - And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
  ans:
  - So, you were a geek. Big deal.

- que:
  - Anita, remember espadrilles?
  ans:
  - Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.

- que:
  - Bridgework?
  ans:
  - Very romantic.

- que:
  - How about this?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.

- que:
  - You need my help?
  ans:
  - No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.

- que:
  - George! What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Just get in the van, Josie.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Hidden camera.

- que:
  - I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
  ans:
  - Wings?

- que:
  - Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
  ans:
  - Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.

- que:
  - That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen? Did I say that out loud?
  ans:
  - That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.

- que:
  - Transitioned?
  ans:
  - You crossed over.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He is totally crunching on you.

- que:
  - Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
  ans:
  - Betty.

- que:
  - Rosalind and Orlando. From \"As You Like It\"? Shakespeare?
  ans:
  - Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.

- que:
  - Eh.
  ans:
  - How many times have I fired her?

- que:
  - Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
  ans:
  - Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.

- que:
  - They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
  ans:
  - A flack jacket.

- que:
  - You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
  ans:
  - Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.

- que:
  - Have you been there?
  ans:
  - Uhh, no.

- que:
  - Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
  ans:
  - Have you been to any parties?

- que:
  - What if I say no?
  ans:
  - Hey there.

- que:
  - Maybe we should go in a different room?
  ans:
  - I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.

- que:
  - You having fun?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.

- que:
  - Hey--what are you thinking about?
  ans:
  - My sword.

- que:
  - Hey Rob, what's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm Rob's prom date.

- que:
  - Don't you remember what they called you?
  ans:
  - Josie Grossie.

- que:
  - Are mom and dad here?
  ans:
  - No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.

- que:
  - Why is that impossible?
  ans:
  - Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.

- que:
  - Is that true?
  ans:
  - Little known fact.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.

- que:
  - So what are you thinking for college?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Are you--scared?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.

- que:
  - You remember that story?
  ans:
  - That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher.

- que:
  - Why do you do that?
  ans:
  - That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--

- que:
  - When are you going to open your eyes?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking when I'm home.

- que:
  - Thanks. They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
  ans:
  - Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.

- que:
  - Do you think you'll find her?
  ans:
  - Yeah, actually I do.

- que:
  - Well, are you here with anybody?
  ans:
  - No, I'm alone.

- que:
  - So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
  ans:
  - Wait, I was going to tell you--

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Billy Prince is asking you to prom.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
  ans:
  - Who are you guys?

- que:
  - I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.

- que:
  - Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
  ans:
  - Well, a ball player.

- que:
  - Are you having fun?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Definitely.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....

- que:
  - Didn't I tell you? I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - If you went away, what would become of me?
  ans:
  - I'm grown up now. I have to leave some time.

- que:
  - Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
  ans:
  - I can't help it.

- que:
  - Just what?
  ans:
  - Just me, I suppose... I'm restless. I can't help it.

- que:
  - Nothing. W-w-what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Taste it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'm not hungry. What's wrong? I spent all morning on that soup. I thought you liked Worm's Wart.

- que:
  - He's conducting experiments of his own.
  ans:
  - Can't you make other creations?

- que:
  - Maybe he doesn't know...
  ans:
  - Experiments?

- que:
  - You got your room straightened out yet?
  ans:
  - It's getting there.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I don't know. COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.

- que:
  - And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
  ans:
  - Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal? Listen - all old houses have stories.

- que:
  - Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away? And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me it's not the gas! Your mother thought she smelled gas.

- que:
  - Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
  ans:
  - Oh, please...

- que:
  - Are you nuts or something? What the hell is that going to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know! I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.

- que:
  - Where's Jesse?
  ans:
  - Could be all night. Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown. Likes prettyboys like you.

- que:
  - You two got a thing going, or what?
  ans:
  - She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.

- que:
  - You got a problem with me, Grady?
  ans:
  - Naw. Just killing time.

- que:
  - Yeah, why?
  ans:
  - Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.

- que:
  - Who told you to choke up that way?
  ans:
  - My Dad. He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.

- que:
  - You remember your dreams, Grady?
  ans:
  - Only the wet ones.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

- que:
  - Are you nuts or something?
  ans:
  - Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening. It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.

- que:
  - I believe you. You had some scary dreams, okay?
  ans:
  - No! I don't know - everything's all mixed up. What difference does it make? I'm in trouble here. I need your help.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's happening again.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Ah, nothing.

- que:
  - Look at this car. Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - Hi! You didn't have to wait.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah, sure.

- que:
  - You know her?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh. Before my time.

- que:
  - This is amazing! Your dream told you where this was?
  ans:
  - Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking. All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.

- que:
  - No. Never. You think that's what it is?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...

- que:
  - And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
  ans:
  - I don't know - into the air I suppose.

- que:
  - I don't know. Where are we going?
  ans:
  - It's a surprise.

- que:
  - Here.
  ans:
  - What is this place?

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I thought you might be able to make a connection.

- que:
  - Any ghosts in here?
  ans:
  - C'mon, cut it out.

- que:
  - Well, what am I supposed to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Concentrate or some- thing.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh. Wait...

- que:
  - About not finding any bogey men?
  ans:
  - I'll get over it.

- que:
  - Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Maybe we can do that. Strictly scientific, of course.

- que:
  - Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
  ans:
  - Ghostbusters are fearless.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know - a sharp pain.

- que:
  - Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.

- que:
  - you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?
  ans:
  - yeah, I had a bad night.

- que:
  - You want to talk about it?
  ans:
  - My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.

- que:
  - Why won't you talk to me?
  ans:
  - Will you leave me alone? Please.

- que:
  - I killed Grady. I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider. Oh my God, he's inside me...
  ans:
  - Jesse, God - what happened?

- que:
  - Who, Jesse?
  ans:
  - he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.

- que:
  - Who? Who's doing this to you?
  ans:
  - Fred Krueger. He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me. He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.

- que:
  - What's so funny?
  ans:
  - We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.

- que:
  - Eggs?
  ans:
  - Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm fine. Just really hot upstairs.

- que:
  - So, school going alright?
  ans:
  - Okay, I guess.

- que:
  - Making friends?
  ans:
  - Maybe we should call a doctor.

- que:
  - I'm not taking drugs, Dad. Can I go to bed now?
  ans:
  - Sure...go ahead.

- que:
  - How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks. Any cute guys gonna be there?
  ans:
  - All of them.

- que:
  - Yor dad picking the music again?
  ans:
  - Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.

- que:
  - You're going out?
  ans:
  - We're going to bed.

- que:
  - Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
  ans:
  - Kristen specializes in strangeness. I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.

- que:
  - Did she always have nightmares?
  ans:
  - They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.

- que:
  - The maid packed a suitcase. Teresa! Teresa?
  ans:
  - What are you still doing up? It's past one.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I had such an awful dream.

- que:
  - Can't it wait till morning?
  ans:
  - Please Mom? I just don't want to be alone.

- que:
  - How's your hand?
  ans:
  - Menthol, regular, ultra-light.

- que:
  - I've been good. When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
  ans:
  - Don't hold your breath.

- que:
  - Girl, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Watching TV.

- que:
  - If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
  ans:
  - Deal. Thanks.

- que:
  - So what do we do about this creep?
  ans:
  - Last time, it was me against him. I wasn't strong enough...alone.

- que:
  - You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
  ans:
  - He's close...

- que:
  - The city that never sleeps. So what will you do now?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm busy with school. New friends. But I'll never forget the old ones.

- que:
  - Do you still...see each other?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm going to see her tonight.

- que:
  - But...it's just a house I've dreamed about. I dream about it all the time. Thank you for what you did last night.
  ans:
  - You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?

- que:
  - Have you ever done that before? Pulled someone into your dream?
  ans:
  - When I was still a kid. My folks got divorced. After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing. I guess I didn't.

- que:
  - That man in my dreams. He's real isn't he?
  ans:
  - He's real.

- que:
  - Nancy? Would you sit with me awhile?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You like gymnastics?
  ans:
  - I was on the team at school. I was never very good, though.

- que:
  - Freddy?
  ans:
  - He's heavy in the halls...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - They sedated me. We're stuck here till it wears off.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So...got the keys to heaven, baby.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The dispensary. I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high. A night at Club meth.

- que:
  - What are these, beauty marks?
  ans:
  - Those are ancient history.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
  ans:
  - Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.

- que:
  - Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
  ans:
  - Fuck off.

- que:
  - Max, where's Kristen?
  ans:
  - She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.

- que:
  - I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
  ans:
  - Restless. Very restless.

- que:
  - It'll be my last chance. Pleese?
  ans:
  - You got five minutes.

- que:
  - Crossed over?
  ans:
  - But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview. I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.

- que:
  - Only if you call me Neil. What was that nursery rhyme all about?
  ans:
  - Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.

- que:
  - Never been here before?
  ans:
  - Must have opened while I was away at school.

- que:
  - Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much. your parents still live around here?
  ans:
  - My mother's dead. Died in her sleep.

- que:
  - I've been to Pittsburgh. Does that count?
  ans:
  - I'm serious.

- que:
  - That's a new one. Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
  ans:
  - That's what I know.

- que:
  - With Hypnocyl?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
  ans:
  - Just until we get things under control.

- que:
  - Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
  ans:
  - We're gonna try.

- que:
  - To who?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - The truth.

- que:
  - Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
  ans:
  - Take it slowly. Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.

- que:
  - What are we going to do?
  ans:
  - There's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands.

- que:
  - The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
  ans:
  - They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.

- que:
  - Who would know where they were hidden?
  ans:
  - There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.

- que:
  - Your dreams?
  ans:
  - Hey, everybody has bad dreams.

- que:
  - What'd you do, take the scenic route?
  ans:
  - Sshhh. No time for that. Come on.

- que:
  - What about Kristen?
  ans:
  - We can't get to her. I've tried.

- que:
  - And what are they?
  ans:
  - The by-product of guilt. Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.

- que:
  - How do we get in?
  ans:
  - They used to keep a spare key.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You're about to attend a funeral. One that's long overdue.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Listen.

- que:
  - There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort. I've seen you before. Sister...?
  ans:
  - Mary Helena.

- que:
  - You do volunteer work at the hospital?
  ans:
  - I come from time to time. When I'm needed.

- que:
  - This wing's been closed for years. What was this place?
  ans:
  - Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men. Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.

- que:
  - You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
  ans:
  - You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - Cooling down.

- que:
  - What did you think?
  ans:
  - Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.

- que:
  - I know what it is. I just can't believe what I'm hearing. What has she talked you into?
  ans:
  - Nothing. They're my patients. It's my decision. I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.

- que:
  - Good. You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog. What do you do?
  ans:
  - I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.

- que:
  - Yeah? What did we ever do?
  ans:
  - Mom and Dad? That's...crazy. They never said...

- que:
  - Where...here?
  ans:
  - I'm in.

- que:
  - I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.

- que:
  - What do you think of the guinea fowl?
  ans:
  - I'm a vegetarian.

- que:
  - I'm sorry? You think you deserve the brownie?
  ans:
  - Well... a shot at it.

- que:
  - And then I... right.
  ans:
  - So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?

- que:
  - Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
  ans:
  - Oh... no one... no one. Just some... guy from the past. I don't know what he's doing here. Bit of an awkward situation.

- que:
  - So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
  ans:
  - I'm an actress.

- que:
  - Oh splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
  ans:
  - Fifteen million dollars.

- que:
  - Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
  ans:
  - No, thanks. I'll just look around.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes. This one though is... very good.

- que:
  - Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Coffee?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
  ans:
  - Really, no.

- que:
  - Do you always say 'no' to everything?
  ans:
  - No. I better be going. Thanks for your help.

- que:
  - Oh hi. Forget something?
  ans:
  - I forgot my bag.

- que:
  - Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
  ans:
  - Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. Four o'clock could be good.

- que:
  - Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
  ans:
  - Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.

- que:
  - Are you busy tonight?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
  ans:
  - If that's all right.

- que:
  - Floppy, huh?
  ans:
  - It's the hair! It's to do with the hair.

- que:
  - Why is she in a wheelchair?
  ans:
  - It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.

- que:
  - And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
  ans:
  - You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.

- que:
  - Busy tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I thought you were leaving.

- que:
  - You abide by rules like that?
  ans:
  - Ahm...

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - So who left who?
  ans:
  - She left me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I'm afraid.

- que:
  - Here we are. Do you want to come up?
  ans:
  - There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.

- que:
  - There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come up?
  ans:
  - To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.

- que:
  - Your boyfriend?
  ans:
  - -- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with. To be honest, I don't realize...

- que:
  - Hi. Can I come in?
  ans:
  - Come in.

- que:
  - Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
  ans:
  - A bath would be great.

- que:
  - I don't know. It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you... and love?
  ans:
  - Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.

- que:
  - I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?
  ans:
  - Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.

- que:
  - Would you like me to take you through your lines?
  ans:
  - Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.

- que:
  - Hand it over. Basic plot?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.

- que:
  - You think I should do Henry James instead?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.

- que:
  - You like Chagall?
  ans:
  - I do. It feels like how being in love should be. Floating through a dark blue sky.

- que:
  - No. What's that?
  ans:
  - Big feet -- large shoes.

- que:
  - You have a stunt bottom?
  ans:
  - I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

- que:
  - Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
  ans:
  - Definitely. Ths is important stuff.

- que:
  - The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
  ans:
  - Both.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.

- que:
  - What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - But... they're odd-looking. They're for milk. Your mum's got them. You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
  ans:
  - Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...

- que:
  - Who was Gilda?
  ans:
  - You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.

- que:
  - Can I stay a bit longer?
  ans:
  - Stay forever.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Don't ask.

- que:
  - Oh my God. And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
  ans:
  - Undressed like this, yes.

- que:
  - How do you think I'm doing?
  ans:
  - I don't know what happened.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.

- que:
  - Well... how have you been?
  ans:
  - I thought I'd give it to you.

- que:
  - What's the thing?
  ans:
  - You were saying...

- que:
  - You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
  ans:
  - Sorry about that.

- que:
  - ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
  ans:
  - ... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.

- que:
  - I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
  ans:
  - I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.

- que:
  - Thank you, Bernie. Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
  ans:
  - Nice surprise.

- que:
  - Liar. She hates surprises. What are you ordering?
  ans:
  - I haven't decided.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Rufus.

- que:
  - Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
  ans:
  - Tempting but... no, thank you.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.

- que:
  - He's bringing a girl?
  ans:
  - Miracles do happen.

- que:
  - Does the girl have a name?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't say.

- que:
  - Christ, what is going on in there?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

- que:
  - Anna Scott?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The movie star?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - He's cooking guinea fowl?
  ans:
  - Don't even ask.

- que:
  - Do you want to stay?
  ans:
  - Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.

- que:
  - This painting isn't the original, is it?
  ans:
  - Yes, I think that one may be.

- que:
  - But she said she wanted to go out with you?
  ans:
  - Yes -- sort of...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...

- que:
  - Is Miss Scott staying here?
  ans:
  - No -- it's my 22nd.

- que:
  - Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?
  ans:
  - Working with Leonardo.

- que:
  - Da Vinci?
  ans:
  - Di Caprio.

- que:
  - Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director?
  ans:
  - By the way -- it's you.

- que:
  - Yes. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Well, yes. Groovy.

- que:
  - I was called and I came. What's up?
  ans:
  - It was good.

- que:
  - It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
  ans:
  - Blimey. What's that?

- que:
  - What do you think? Good move?
  ans:
  - Ahm... room service.

- que:
  - Oh great. Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
  ans:
  - I'll see what I can do.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Ahm... Bernie.

- que:
  - Pleased to meet you. Did you like the film?
  ans:
  - Ah... yes, enormously.

- que:
  - Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - Any bit in particular?
  ans:
  - Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.

- que:
  - Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much. Did you enjoy making that bit?
  ans:
  - Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.

- que:
  - Who? Someone famous?
  ans:
  - Topol.

- que:
  - So it could have been neither of them?
  ans:
  - I suppose so.

- que:
  - Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
  ans:
  - Not classic, no.

- que:
  - Right -- want another one?
  ans:
  - Yes. No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.

- que:
  - Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
  ans:
  - But it's not for the shop. It's for you.

- que:
  - Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
  ans:
  - Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.

- que:
  - Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
  ans:
  - Max. This is Anna.

- que:
  - You haven't slept with her, have you?
  ans:
  - That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.

- que:
  - Do you ever masturbate?
  ans:
  - I think you do, yes.

- que:
  - No -- did you?
  ans:
  - Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.

- que:
  - Buggered?
  ans:
  - Every time. But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - She's perfect, perfect.

- que:
  - Any more announcements?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.

- que:
  - May I help you, sir?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.

- que:
  - How about Miss Flintstone?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...

- que:
  - Does she know you're coming?
  ans:
  - No, no. She doesn't.

- que:
  - This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
  ans:
  - That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.

- que:
  - What are the choices?
  ans:
  - Well... wait for it... First there's this one...

- que:
  - Cool, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.

- que:
  - Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
  ans:
  - Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...

- que:
  - So -- any messages?
  ans:
  - Yeh, I wrote a couple down.

- que:
  - Right. No one else?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not.

- que:
  - Which was?
  ans:
  - No, 'fraid not.

- que:
  - That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
  ans:
  - Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.

- que:
  - You're welcome. Did you find them?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
  ans:
  - I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.

- que:
  - I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
  ans:
  - Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.

- que:
  - I wouldn't go outside.
  ans:
  - Right. Right. You think it's the wrong moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Just take my work for it.

- que:
  - Was it you?
  ans:
  - I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm going to throw out these old videos.

- que:
  - Which floor?
  ans:
  - Three.

- que:
  - Are you sure you...?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Which hospital?
  ans:
  - Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.

- que:
  - How was she?
  ans:
  - Fabulous.

- que:
  - Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
  ans:
  - Excuse me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.

- que:
  - What book?
  ans:
  - The one down your trousers.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I can only speculate as to the reasons why.

- que:
  - Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
  ans:
  - No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...

- que:
  - Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
  ans:
  - No. Mister Harding, that is not true.

- que:
  - Would you like to start?
  ans:
  - N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.

- que:
  - Yes, Billy?
  ans:
  - I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.

- que:
  - Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
  ans:
  - Y-y-y-yes...

- que:
  - What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
  ans:
  - I was in luh-love with her.

- que:
  - Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
  ans:
  - Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?

- que:
  - Is there anything else?
  ans:
  - Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.

- que:
  - How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
  ans:
  - That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.

- que:
  - Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
  ans:
  - No way.

- que:
  - But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
  ans:
  - Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?

- que:
  - You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.

- que:
  - Yes, ma'am?
  ans:
  - Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.

- que:
  - Yes, Miss Ratched?
  ans:
  - Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.

- que:
  - Yes, Miss Ratched?
  ans:
  - Please see to Mister Bromden.

- que:
  - Whatcha boys playin'?
  ans:
  - H-H-Hearts.

- que:
  - What's your name, buddy?
  ans:
  - B-B-Billy.

- que:
  - Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
  ans:
  - That's okay, kid...

- que:
  - Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
  ans:
  - No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.

- que:
  - W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
  ans:
  - So long, kid.

- que:
  - H-Hey, M-Mack.
  ans:
  - Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?

- que:
  - Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
  ans:
  - Yeah, kid?

- que:
  - H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
  ans:
  - Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...

- que:
  - In ya go...
  ans:
  - Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?

- que:
  - M-M-M-Mack?
  ans:
  - It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...

- que:
  - Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Ya like that, Chief, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - What? Where?
  ans:
  - In there.

- que:
  - That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
  ans:
  - Shhh...

- que:
  - How ya gettin' out, Mac?
  ans:
  - Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.

- que:
  - Where's Martini and Scanlon?
  ans:
  - Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.

- que:
  - What? What?
  ans:
  - So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.

- que:
  - Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
  ans:
  - Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.

- que:
  - Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
  ans:
  - Through the ass.

- que:
  - Your buddy is callin' ya.
  ans:
  - Ya know what, Fred?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm seeing what a busy man does.

- que:
  - That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
  ans:
  - Did to you and all the rest of you guys.

- que:
  - And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
  ans:
  - Just warmin' up.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I'm busting outta this place.

- que:
  - What's your plan, Mack?
  ans:
  - Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'm not running a charity ward...

- que:
  - What's he talkin' about?
  ans:
  - Big king, too bad...

- que:
  - Hear what?
  ans:
  - McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Yesterday...

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - Gary Blinker...

- que:
  - Can you borrow me a dime?
  ans:
  - Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Hit me.

- que:
  - Yeah, Mac?
  ans:
  - Bye-bye.

- que:
  - Oh, what's that?
  ans:
  - Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.

- que:
  - My, my... Ah, who are you?
  ans:
  - McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.

- que:
  - Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
  ans:
  - Oh, what was that?

- que:
  - In what way?
  ans:
  - I see...

- que:
  - Well, ya know, Doc... Doesn't it say so there?
  ans:
  - I don't, Doc...

- que:
  - Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
  ans:
  - No, this is my first trip, Doc.

- que:
  - How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.

- que:
  - Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
  ans:
  - Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - We'll let you know.

- que:
  - What's the horse pill for, honey?
  ans:
  - It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...

- que:
  - Are you a doctor?
  ans:
  - No, 'fraid not...

- que:
  - What's troubling ya, buddy?
  ans:
  - I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.

- que:
  - How do ya know that?
  ans:
  - Because I quit breathing.

- que:
  - Up an' at 'em, Taber.
  ans:
  - You think it's funny, huh?

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Sure...

- que:
  - That right?
  ans:
  - You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.

- que:
  - Yeah, what's up?
  ans:
  - Prayin', brother. Prayin'.

- que:
  - Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
  ans:
  - Kay...

- que:
  - Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
  ans:
  - Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.

- que:
  - Hey, how ya doin'?
  ans:
  - Fine, thank you. Here, please take these.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - To help you relax... please...

- que:
  - You comin' in to hold my hand?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
  ans:
  - He's a patient, Rose...

- que:
  - Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
  ans:
  - He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - He's in charge.

- que:
  - Are you a doctor?
  ans:
  - Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - P.A. What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - Potential assaultive.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Asshole.

- que:
  - How 'bout twenty?
  ans:
  - No way...

- que:
  - Is everything all right?
  ans:
  - Why, sure, ma'am...

- que:
  - At this hour?
  ans:
  - Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...

- que:
  - What are these men doing up wandering around?
  ans:
  - Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...

- que:
  - Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
  ans:
  - What happened?

- que:
  - Is he one of the loonies?
  ans:
  - They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.

- que:
  - Are they dangerous when they're awake?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.

- que:
  - Is he in an asylum?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - He is your husband, no?
  ans:
  - Yes, but... He was having an affair.

- que:
  - Your grandmother?
  ans:
  - Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.

- que:
  - May I see your boarding pass, please?
  ans:
  - I-- I must've misplaced it.

- que:
  - You ask what room he's in, okay?
  ans:
  - Buona notte.

- que:
  - Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago. He said his plans had changed unexpectedly. Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
  ans:
  - He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.

- que:
  - Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
  ans:
  - Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because.

- que:
  - So, what's the story with your friend?
  ans:
  - My friend has lost her fucking mind...

- que:
  - What's she doing?
  ans:
  - She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.

- que:
  - No, really. What's she doing?
  ans:
  - Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.

- que:
  - Were they pen pals?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?

- que:
  - My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Your hair... is perfect.

- que:
  - Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne?
  ans:
  - You're sure...

- que:
  - We found each other, didn't we?
  ans:
  - Yes. We did.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.

- que:
  - I don't get it. She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
  ans:
  - Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.

- que:
  - Who's dying?
  ans:
  - Your great aunt.

- que:
  - Oh no. Do you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Dwayne?
  ans:
  - Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.

- que:
  - Sa dov'e' lui?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Ha un numero di telefono?
  ans:
  - ...has a prior commitment.

- que:
  - What's mezzaluna?
  ans:
  - A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.

- que:
  - Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
  ans:
  - Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.

- que:
  - Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
  ans:
  - If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that. And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell.

- que:
  - It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it? I knew that was too much.
  ans:
  - Larry, can I borrow your car keys?

- que:
  - My picture's up?
  ans:
  - Congratulations.

- que:
  - It's an amazing place, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Amazing.

- que:
  - Smoking or non-smoking?
  ans:
  - Non. Please.

- que:
  - Lots of history. For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
  ans:
  - Hm.

- que:
  - Hello? Is anybody there?
  ans:
  - Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.

- que:
  - I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that?
  ans:
  - Damon Bradley...

- que:
  - I'm at the airport. Why?
  ans:
  - Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.

- que:
  - I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
  ans:
  - Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...

- que:
  - How could you do this to me?
  ans:
  - I'm in love with you.

- que:
  - Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that?
  ans:
  - You're limping.

- que:
  - Are you okay? You want some help?
  ans:
  - NO.

- que:
  - Why can't you just tell me?
  ans:
  - If it's any of your business, yes.

- que:
  - He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
  ans:
  - You didn't answer my question.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So it wasn't real.

- que:
  - What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
  ans:
  - No, that wasn't a lie. That was... a mirage.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because. I know where he is.

- que:
  - Where's Positano?
  ans:
  - It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because-- I want you to be happy.

- que:
  - He likes to read... Did he mention anyone in particular?
  ans:
  - Uh, I'd rather not say.

- que:
  - Mickey Spillane?
  ans:
  - Or Hustler.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.

- que:
  - Do you want me to do it?
  ans:
  - NO.

- que:
  - Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
  ans:
  - Nice dress.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - We were hungry.

- que:
  - I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
  ans:
  - The Boston Pops. Season tickets.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - No. Are you're leaving?
  ans:
  - No. I just came by to apologize.

- que:
  - You aren't?
  ans:
  - No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.

- que:
  - Are you asking me out?
  ans:
  - Yes. I am.

- que:
  - There's no such thing.
  ans:
  - Is something the matter?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.

- que:
  - I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
  ans:
  - No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play.

- que:
  - I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
  ans:
  - Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.

- que:
  - What would you call it?
  ans:
  - I would call it-- unforgivable.

- que:
  - Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.

- que:
  - That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
  ans:
  - If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.

- que:
  - You're Damon Bradley?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Been here long?
  ans:
  - Just since yesterday.

- que:
  - Tonight?
  ans:
  - Any night.

- que:
  - Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You would? Really?
  ans:
  - I'll look forward to it.

- que:
  - Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
  ans:
  - Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really...

- que:
  - Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it. You're my guest.

- que:
  - What looks good?
  ans:
  - Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...

- que:
  - So what do you think?
  ans:
  - Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Let's face it. You want me.

- que:
  - I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it... Is Larry here?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He's around somewhere.

- que:
  - What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
  ans:
  - No. He smokes.

- que:
  - How about that guy at the bank?
  ans:
  - Scientologist.

- que:
  - Is everything okay?
  ans:
  - But somebody wrote those songs.

- que:
  - So, what's your point?
  ans:
  - Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.

- que:
  - Is he married?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is he gay?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't think so.

- que:
  - What's he do?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Kate.

- que:
  - You don't have any idea?
  ans:
  - He's a podiatrist or something.

- que:
  - \"Thrills\"? That's what you're waiting for? You know how long that lasts? Besides, how do you know? Have you ever been out with him?
  ans:
  - No. He's never asked me.

- que:
  - If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
  ans:
  - He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him.

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.

- que:
  - Kate, is something the matter?
  ans:
  - Larry brought me flowers last night.

- que:
  - Have you seen him with someone?
  ans:
  - No... I can just tell.

- que:
  - What about your job?
  ans:
  - I have vacation time coming to me.

- que:
  - Does Dwayne know about this?
  ans:
  - Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either.

- que:
  - I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
  ans:
  - Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.

- que:
  - You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
  ans:
  - How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--

- que:
  - The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again?
  ans:
  - It's called... the Gritty Palace.

- que:
  - \"Gritty\"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
  ans:
  - I don't know... Maybe. Think of it as an adventure.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - \"Of the Rich and Famous\". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - He fell out.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Ah ha!...

- que:
  - What'd you find?
  ans:
  - A Butterfinger wrapper.

- que:
  - Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
  ans:
  - Only, it's in Italian...

- que:
  - Couldn't we just have taken a train?
  ans:
  - The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.

- que:
  - You expecting somebody you know?
  ans:
  - Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.

- que:
  - So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him.

- que:
  - You think he misses me at all?
  ans:
  - Course he does.

- que:
  - Larry bought himself cologne?
  ans:
  - Polo.

- que:
  - All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous. God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
  ans:
  - You're right. At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself. Smile.

- que:
  - You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
  ans:
  - So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him.

- que:
  - Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
  ans:
  - Because I'm the one who's single.

- que:
  - Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here?
  ans:
  - He's heeeeeerrre...

- que:
  - Is he looking at us?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Right, right... Okay.. You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
  ans:
  - That was really sweet...

- que:
  - Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.

- que:
  - Sightseeing... What're you doing?
  ans:
  - Packing.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.

- que:
  - A little bad luck?
  ans:
  - Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.

- que:
  - So you're just quitting? Just like that?
  ans:
  - I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.

- que:
  - It was a ouija board, remember?
  ans:
  - ...and a fortune teller.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.

- que:
  - You sure you'll be okay?
  ans:
  - I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.

- que:
  - Yes. Isn't that amazing?
  ans:
  - Amazing...

- que:
  - What if he doesn't like me?
  ans:
  - It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.

- que:
  - Faith, I'm kidding. Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
  ans:
  - Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help.

- que:
  - Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
  ans:
  - Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says \"nuculear\" and \"irregardless\".

- que:
  - Kate is that you?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
  ans:
  - Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.

- que:
  - I'm fine. Have you seen Peter?
  ans:
  - He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.

- que:
  - Larry, did you rent a car?
  ans:
  - And you are?...

- que:
  - You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
  ans:
  - No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later.

- que:
  - My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying?
  ans:
  - She's saying he's a-- a-- porco.

- que:
  - A porco?
  ans:
  - A pig! A pig! She's saying he's a pig.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - That's exactly what you are.

- que:
  - No, why?
  ans:
  - Well, there's nothing here to eat.

- que:
  - This is the last one before the wedding, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - And we didn't have to bring another present?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - We're all desperate for the money, doll. That's what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
  ans:
  - Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll.

- que:
  - What? You know him?
  ans:
  - It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.

  ans:
  - She didn't give me a chance.

- que:
  - She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?

- que:

  ans:

  - Why should he forget it?
  ans:
  - Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.

  ans:
  - I wish I knew.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do, Johnny?
  ans:
  - You said they was only going to talk to him.

- que:
  - And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
  ans:
  - The moment I saw you.

- que:
  - How would you've done it?
  ans:
  - With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Pardon me while I reach for my beads.

- que:
  - What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and I had to take a few dives.

- que:
  - Now what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere. Miss Four Corners.

- que:
  - I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
  ans:
  - What made you want to be a fighter?

- que:
  - Why, Terry, who said it was?
  ans:
  - Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.

  - Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.

- que:
  - Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together. You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
  ans:
  - I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.

- que:
  - Who was the friend?
  ans:
  - Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.

- que:

  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah, I got a problem. This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns. Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - How much for your company at chow?
  ans:
  - Company, shit. I watch the man's back.

- que:
  - I bet. How much?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I don't smoke.

- que:
  - Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
  ans:
  - Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

- que:
  - It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
  ans:
  - Low class of people there, Snoop.

- que:
  - Glenn didn't tell you?
  ans:
  - Let's go outside and talk.

- que:
  - Who's sitting here?
  ans:
  - Your homie, Glenn. Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.

- que:
  - The fuck you talking about?
  ans:
  - Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...

- que:
  - Look, what you worried about Glenn for? What's he know?
  ans:
  - I thought everything.

- que:
  - That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
  ans:
  - Break and enter, shit. Take it and git, how it's done. Don't waste any time. That's how you do it.

- que:
  - So you've done this before, huh?
  ans:
  - Shit, yeah. White Boy even got busted for it. White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.

- que:
  - You know how to use one a these?
  ans:
  - I've seen 'em used on TV.

- que:
  - Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
  ans:
  - Not until recently.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - Why you're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
  ans:
  - I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.

- que:
  - You comfy?
  ans:
  - If I could have a little more room.

- que:
  - There isn't any. All this shit you got in here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
  ans:
  - For your breath. You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.

- que:
  - Where's your gun, your pistol?
  ans:
  - In my bag, in the car.

- que:
  - Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too. Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
  ans:
  - The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.

- que:
  - Buddy. That's his given name?
  ans:
  - One I gave him, yeah. Fuck...

- que:
  - Why, are you famous?
  ans:
  - Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.

- que:
  - How many was that?
  ans:
  - That's funny.

- que:
  - Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
  ans:
  - I don't have to. I don't rob banks.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving. Bonnie was eating a sandwich.

- que:
  - You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
  ans:
  - It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.

- que:
  - You know who this is?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who was it answered the phone?
  ans:
  - None of your business.

- que:
  - How do we do that?
  ans:
  - Let's see. You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because you're having too much fun.

- que:
  - Why? You think he might tell you where I am?
  ans:
  - Unless you wanna tell me.

- que:
  - Don't leave me.
  ans:
  - Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?

- que:
  - Those guys bother you?
  ans:
  - No, they're all right. I meant, you just got here.

- que:
  - You like bourbon?
  ans:
  - Love it.

- que:
  - Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for a living?
  ans:
  - I'm a sales rep. I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.

- que:
  - What, as a sales rep?
  ans:
  - A girl.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - It smelled.

- que:
  - I don't think it works if we're somebody else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
  ans:
  - It's your game. I've never played this before.

- que:
  - Well, does it make sense to you?
  ans:
  - Or once.

- que:
  - If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.

- que:
  - What were you gonna do with me?
  ans:
  - You waved to me in the elevator.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Outside Adele's.

- que:
  - You were going to see her?
  ans:
  - To warn her about Chino.

- que:
  - So she did help you?
  ans:
  - I don't think we should get into that.

- que:
  - You coming back?
  ans:
  - I'm just going to the bathroom.

- que:
  - Why are you mad?
  ans:
  - Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill. Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.

- que:
  - What about my motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You getting serious on me now?
  ans:
  - I'm trying not to. I just wanna know what's gonna happen.

- que:
  - You think I'd shoot you?
  ans:
  - If you don't, one of those guys will.

- que:
  - So. What's your point?
  ans:
  - My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.

- que:
  - You think he's lying?
  ans:
  - Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were somebody else.

- que:
  - Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc. What's going on?
  ans:
  - Oh, nuthin'.

- que:
  - In the trunk?
  ans:
  - The backseat.

- que:
  - What happened to your shades? Someone finally step on 'em?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Whose blood you got all over you?
  ans:
  - These guys, man, they're crazy. Shit.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.

- que:
  - Okay. How many going out?
  ans:
  - I hear six.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Looks like tonight.

- que:
  - You know who they are?
  ans:
  - I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.

- que:
  - Sounds high, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Must be a real soft pillow.

- que:
  - Tell me something. What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I never used a gun.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.

- que:
  - Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Twenty-two months, three days, two hours. Why?
  ans:
  - It's a little late for me.

- que:
  - The fish?
  ans:
  - I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.

- que:
  - And the guy sent you a bill for this?
  ans:
  - It works. You should try it sometime.

- que:
  - You goin' right back to work?
  ans:
  - First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs?
  ans:
  - Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

- que:
  - What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
  ans:
  - We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in Florida.

- que:
  - You gonna write me a check?
  ans:
  - We'll go to my bank. I'll make a withdrawal.

- que:
  - Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
  ans:
  - Five point two.

- que:
  - Hejira? What kinda name is that?
  ans:
  - Islamic.

- que:
  - What's it mean, \"No Hair\"?
  ans:
  - The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.

- que:
  - The flight?
  ans:
  - The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.

- que:
  - You were at Leavenworth, huh?
  ans:
  - For a time.

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - Meaning time came, I left.

- que:
  - You busted out?
  ans:
  - I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.

- que:
  - That time?
  ans:
  - There were others.

- que:
  - The ninth?
  ans:
  - Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's a long way down to Florida.

- que:
  - You don't remember me, do you?
  ans:
  - It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking. I was never out there.

- que:
  - Do we have a gun in the car?
  ans:
  - I remember you now. Shit.

- que:
  - What am I supposed to do now?
  ans:
  - Glenn, take the exit.

- que:
  - Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
  ans:
  - Jesus, I don't believe it.

- que:
  - Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
  ans:
  - I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.

- que:
  - I already stole it. Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't be stealing it again, can I?
  ans:
  - The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.

- que:
  - You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
  ans:
  - For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.

- que:
  - What's going on, Glenn?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.

- que:
  - But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
  ans:
  - Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.

- que:
  - And is Foley a part of this?
  ans:
  - He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.

- que:
  - But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
  ans:
  - I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me...

- que:
  - You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
  ans:
  - If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. It's wide open.

- que:
  - So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
  ans:
  - I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy there.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Wait a minute. I'm letting you in on this, not all your friends.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yeah. If you can step up and actually do it. Understand? 'Stead of just talking the talk.

- que:
  - Can I do what?
  ans:
  - Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.

- que:
  - What-- when?
  ans:
  - Right now, son.

- que:
  - Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.

- que:
  - Why would I do that?
  ans:
  - Hi, Ray.

- que:
  - You look great. Your dad taking good care of you?
  ans:
  - He took the week off so we'd have time together. So far he's worked on his boat every day. Dad? Ray Nicolet.

- que:
  - How's it going?
  ans:
  - Great. We got one of 'em.

- que:
  - How you know that?
  ans:
  - I can tell.

- que:
  - Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
  ans:
  - Flyweight.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for Maurice.

- que:
  - That's not Maurice?
  ans:
  - That's Kenneth, my brother. He's talking on the phone.

- que:
  - You like to sit down?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - You not with probation, one of those?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No, I'm not. Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
  ans:
  - Glenn? No, I don't know any Glenn.

- que:
  - Here? In this house?
  ans:
  - He said he stayed with Maurice.

- que:
  - Your dog was killed?
  ans:
  - Got run over by a car.

- que:
  - What did you call it?
  ans:
  - Was a she, name Tuffy.

- que:
  - Where do you think I might find Maurice?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I know he don't miss the fights. Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater. He use to take me.

- que:
  - You fit another Chanel suit in here?
  ans:
  - Something better. Open it.

- que:
  - Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke?
  ans:
  - Can't. I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.

- que:
  - Which one is that? The ATF guy?
  ans:
  - He was. Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.

- que:
  - He's still married though, huh?
  ans:
  - Technically. They're separated.

- que:
  - Oh, he's moved out?
  ans:
  - He's about to.

- que:
  - What're you doing at Glades?
  ans:
  - You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.

- que:
  - How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
  ans:
  - I'd like that.

- que:
  - Huh.
  ans:
  - What'd I say?

- que:
  - What are you thinking about?
  ans:
  - The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No, he looks a lot...

- que:
  - Off a tip?
  ans:
  - Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For you.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - He's pretty laid back, confident.

- que:
  - He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - He waved to you?
  ans:
  - I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.

- que:
  - You wave back?
  ans:
  - I didn't have time.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.

- que:
  - It's possible. Why?
  ans:
  - He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him to rob banks.

- que:
  - Not yet. Where's Mr. Ripley?
  ans:
  - I told you, he isn't here.

- que:
  - Out for the evening?
  ans:
  - He's in Florida. Palm Beach.

- que:
  - You here all by yourself?
  ans:
  - That's right, just me.

- que:
  - How do I look, mama?
  ans:
  - Like a fag.

- que:
  - In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, \"Undercover\"?
  ans:
  - No. Course not.

- que:
  - Did you pay the guy the reward?
  ans:
  - Yeah, as soon as we got back.

- que:
  - That's how you score now?
  ans:
  - The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet. But then, I could be wrong...

- que:
  - Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the fish thing?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sure. It's all settled.

- que:
  - Where you been hiding, Dick?
  ans:
  - Midge.

- que:
  - BOB We have a problem here?
  ans:
  - Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

- que:
  - White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
  ans:
  - BOB Ten gees.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. You recall, did it say dead or alive?
  ans:
  - BOB I think he must've fell in.

- que:
  - That's your line for tonight, ya know.
  ans:
  - BOB Are they dead?

- que:
  - What is it with Red? I've never seen him this way.
  ans:
  - Are you sure they're here?

- que:
  - Now listen, it's hands off Billy. I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
  ans:
  - He's been like that all day. Hey Danny, you coming?

- que:
  - He was that good?
  ans:
  - No, I was.

- que:
  - But...they called you Strange? Because of Red Grange? I don't get it. Was Red Grange strange?
  ans:
  - How would I know.

- que:
  - COMMANDER On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
  ans:
  - That's me, Sir.

- que:
  - COMMANDER Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.

- que:
  - You're Walker, right?
  ans:
  - Yes Sir.

- que:
  - You liked that?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I don't buy that hot dog shit. So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.

- que:
  - Hale-what?
  ans:
  - You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.

- que:
  - What lizard?
  ans:
  - The one that slept in my mouth last night.

- que:
  - What the hell happened to you guys?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Ever hear of mai-tai's? Comes in a big...pot. Like...like...
  ans:
  - Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

- que:
  - A m-missionary?
  ans:
  - No, like...

- que:
  - They ready, Earl?
  ans:
  - Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.

- que:
  - Who the fuck taught you to fly?
  ans:
  - The Colonel helped me work it out.

- que:
  - I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.

- que:
  - Didn't you say you told her not to come?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Then why are you looking for her?
  ans:
  - You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.

- que:
  - Upset? Why should I be upset?
  ans:
  - Let's go get a drink. Unless you're scared to talk about it.

- que:
  - What facts are those?
  ans:
  - I was grieving too.

- que:
  - So what are you saying?
  ans:
  - I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.

- que:
  - You left her. How's that for a fact?
  ans:
  - How's this for a fact? I loved her first.

- que:
  - How come you're not pukin'?
  ans:
  - I guess I'm used to it. I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.

- que:
  - What's there?
  ans:
  - It's tight.

- que:
  - You hear my okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.

- que:
  - I got a half a tank. You?
  ans:
  - Little less.

- que:
  - What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
  ans:
  - Fun today. Like old times.

- que:
  - Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
  ans:
  - What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.

- que:
  - Hey! What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
  ans:
  - The brass is afraid of sabotage. This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.

- que:
  - Who's gonna to that? Japan is four thousand miles away. So you guys just arrived, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How's everything?
  ans:
  - We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.

- que:
  - I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
  ans:
  - Well...sure.

- que:
  - We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
  ans:
  - From the air?

- que:
  - Then wh-where do we land?
  ans:
  - I have a phrase I want you all to memorize, \"Lushu hoo megwa fugi.\" It means \"I am an American.\" In Chinese.

- que:
  - How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
  ans:
  - Don't get smart with me, son.

- que:
  - Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
  ans:
  - Explain what?

- que:
  - How'd you get this?
  ans:
  - Boxin'.

- que:
  - Win?
  ans:
  - Yes'm.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Dorie Miller, 'Mam.

- que:
  - How often you fight like this?
  ans:
  - Every other Sunday. I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.

- que:
  - What do you get for winning?
  ans:
  - Respect.

- que:
  - Danny's not coming?
  ans:
  - No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.

- que:
  - You waited til tonight to tell me?
  ans:
  - I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say.

- que:
  - I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Nothing that won't heal. I guess.

- que:
  - And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all. As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
  ans:
  - The second wave has not returned. And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?

- que:
  - What if the Japanese did invade?
  ans:
  - We've done studies. We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.

- que:
  - Have the planes made it to China?
  ans:
  - So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.

- que:
  - Well which of those three ya want fixed?
  ans:
  - All of 'em.

- que:
  - You see us as capable of such a blow?
  ans:
  - The Americans themselves have made it possible. We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

- que:
  - What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
  ans:
  - I'm not telling.

- que:
  - What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
  ans:
  - It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.

- que:
  - Do you believe in all of that?
  ans:
  - I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.

- que:
  - Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
  ans:
  - I'd take better care of my teeth.

- que:
  - What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
  ans:
  - Stag movies. Smokers.

- que:
  - I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before?
  ans:
  - The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.

- que:
  - Do you have to wear that hat?
  ans:
  - It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.

- que:
  - How do you like my hair?
  ans:
  - But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.

- que:
  - Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.

- que:
  - Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.

- que:
  - Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
  ans:
  - Who knows. Remember... Whatever Walter wants...

- que:
  - The only one?
  ans:
  - Well, besides Charlie, of course.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - Were taking you back to the nurse.

  ans:
  - We're going to take you home.

  ans:
  - Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.

- que:
  - Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
  ans:
  - Just what you underlined.

- que:
  - Come on. What's with you and Michael?
  ans:
  - I bet Dolores told Charlie.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - It's that jerk Walter.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.

- que:
  - Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
  ans:
  - Can you believe I want to marry that dork.

- que:
  - Why do guys do such stupid things?
  ans:
  - Charlie really has a great voice.

- que:
  - But you love me don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.

- que:
  - You got a Tab?
  ans:

- que:
  - Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
  ans:
  - I'm not going.

- que:
  - Charlie! Am I dead?
  ans:
  - No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - Pretty strange.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.

- que:
  - How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
  ans:
  - Maybe I blocked it out.

- que:
  - Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
  ans:
  - They'll learn to live with it.

- que:
  - Would you?
  ans:
  - Would I?!! Why I oughta...

- que:
  - Great, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.

- que:
  - Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
  ans:
  - Right. I promised my mother.

- que:
  - Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
  ans:
  - He's trying.

- que:
  - Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
  ans:
  - Come on, let's dance.

- que:
  - You really love me, don't you?
  ans:
  - You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.

  - What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
  ans:
  - A lot's happened since last weekend.

- que:
  - Save it.
  ans:
  - I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?

- que:
  - What do you know about classical music?
  ans:
  - Nothing.. Selling is selling.

- que:
  - What am I going to do with you?
  ans:
  - Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Let's go down to the basement.

- que:
  - And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
  ans:
  - Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.

- que:
  - What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
  ans:
  - Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.

- que:
  - How'd you know about that?
  ans:
  - I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.

- que:
  - Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
  ans:
  - What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.

- que:
  - You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
  ans:
  - Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.

- que:
  - Does this mean you like me again?
  ans:
  - It means I care about you and what happens to you.

- que:
  - What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.

- que:
  - Let me got! Where are you taking me?
  ans:
  - Right here. Now sit down.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!

- que:
  - Will you take me back to my grandparents?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
  ans:
  - Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?

- que:
  - Charlie? Was I dead?
  ans:
  - I thought you were...for a while.

- que:
  - What about Janet?
  ans:
  - That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.

- que:
  - Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
  ans:
  - Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.

- que:
  - What would that be, sir?
  ans:
  - Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.

- que:
  - Test?
  ans:
  - Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - Take a long walk on a short pier.

- que:
  - What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
  ans:
  - Terry, slow down.

- que:
  - What, why?
  ans:
  - There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.

- que:
  - Fine. ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
  ans:
  - That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.

- que:
  - She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.

- que:
  - You don't?
  ans:
  - He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...

- que:
  - What're you doing here anyway?
  ans:
  - Coffee and a donut.

- que:
  - Don't you get along with your parents?
  ans:
  - The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.

- que:
  - No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
  ans:
  - I'd love to.

- que:
  - Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
  ans:
  - I can't do that.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.

- que:
  - Can we split now?
  ans:
  - I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.

- que:
  - If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
  ans:
  - I think I'm way ahead of them.

- que:
  - Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
  ans:
  - At my age? Don't be silly.

- que:
  - Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
  ans:
  - Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.

- que:
  - For me?
  ans:
  - Open it.

- que:
  - Quiet today?
  ans:
  - This morning was good.

- que:
  - I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - This is your great invention? Would you wear those things?
  ans:
  - That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.

- que:
  - You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
  ans:
  - Wrong, Dad. Your idea.

- que:
  - How did it go with the pantyhose?
  ans:
  - Oh, you're both so naive.

- que:
  - I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
  ans:
  - Please don't shout.

- que:
  - Does everybody have to hear?
  ans:
  - I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - I'm excused.

- que:
  - What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
  ans:
  - Oh. I forgot.

- que:
  - When did you start drinking coffee?
  ans:
  - Oh. Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.

- que:
  - Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
  ans:
  - What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - The house payments.

- que:
  - Who was that man?
  ans:
  - It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.

- que:
  - Would you get that, dear?
  ans:
  - Sure, Mom. Hello.

- que:
  - Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma.

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - I had a dream that Grandma died.

- que:
  - She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
  ans:
  - Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Maddy's party.

- que:
  - Where have you been?
  ans:
  - Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.

- que:
  - Isn't that awfully forward?
  ans:
  - We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.

- que:
  - Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
  ans:
  - No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.

- que:
  - What does Charlie think about that?
  ans:
  - You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm just happy to see you.

- que:
  - Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - It's unbelievable. The man never ages.

- que:
  - You think this'll cheer Dad up?
  ans:
  - Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.

- que:
  - Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
  ans:
  - I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.

- que:
  - What was?
  ans:
  - Dancing with you.

- que:
  - It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
  ans:
  - All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.

- que:
  - Are you doing some kind of science project?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.

- que:
  - So you think time travel is possible? For people?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.

- que:
  - Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
  ans:
  - Okay. I promise.

- que:
  - How, did you know about my grandfather?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Am I dead or not?
  ans:
  - There's one way to find out.

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.

- que:
  - What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
  ans:
  - You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.

- que:
  - What if you're not here tomorrow?
  ans:
  - The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.

- que:
  - But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
  ans:
  - I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.

- que:
  - Give me some credit, will you?
  ans:
  - Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.

- que:
  - Wbat're you talking about?
  ans:
  - Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.

- que:
  - When do we start?
  ans:
  - Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.

- que:
  - Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
  ans:
  - Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.

- que:
  - That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
  ans:
  - Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.

- que:
  - Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
  ans:
  - No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.

- que:
  - Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
  ans:
  - Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...

- que:
  - What will they be made of?
  ans:
  - I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.

- que:
  - In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
  ans:
  - No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.

- que:
  - You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
  ans:
  - No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.

- que:
  - Will you take of f your blouse?
  ans:
  - Yes, every day. Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.

- que:
  - That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
  ans:
  - I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.

- que:
  - God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
  ans:
  - Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.

- que:
  - Did you break up with Charlie?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.

- que:
  - Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
  ans:
  - I... um...

- que:
  - Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
  ans:
  - Pretty much so.

- que:
  - I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
  ans:
  - I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.

- que:
  - How'd you know that?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...

- que:
  - Yes... why?
  ans:
  - Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...

- que:
  - Is something wrong?
  ans:
  - Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.

- que:
  - Out?
  ans:
  - He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - I had a little run-in with Zowie.

- que:
  - How long ago did this guy retire?
  ans:
  - It's been a few years.

- que:
  - What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Hey! How was your first day at school?
  ans:
  - It sucked.

- que:
  - You alright?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.

- que:
  - Just out.
  ans:
  - Hey! Where're you off to?

- que:
  - I'm not hungry.
  ans:
  - I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...

- que:
  - All set?
  ans:
  - All set.

- que:
  - So where're we going?
  ans:
  - Anywhere but here.

- que:
  - Is he gonna be okay?
  ans:
  - Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.

- que:
  - Just until he heals up?
  ans:
  - Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.

- que:
  - Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
  ans:
  - I'm not trying to prove anything. I was burying my dog.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - Zowie.

- que:
  - What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
  ans:
  - Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...

- que:
  - Is this a good spot?
  ans:
  - I'm not burying him here...

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - There's a better place...

- que:
  - What did?
  ans:
  - The old Indian burial ground.

- que:
  - You want me to help?
  ans:
  - You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...

- que:
  - How can he not have a heartbeat?
  ans:
  - Maybe it takes a while...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...

- que:
  - What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
  ans:
  - I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...

- que:
  - Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
  ans:
  - I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...

- que:
  - Dies?
  ans:
  - I gotta go back and do my chores...

- que:
  - You ever think about running away?
  ans:
  - All the time.

- que:
  - Geoff? Anybody see my boy?
  ans:
  - Right here, Mom...

- que:
  - How long have you been here?
  ans:
  - Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.

- que:
  - How did it go with your father last night?
  ans:
  - Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...

- que:
  - You know everything, don't you?
  ans:
  - Mom...

- que:
  - Are we interrupting, Andy?
  ans:
  - In a word, Bob...

- que:
  - Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
  ans:
  - Bailey, Brackman.

- que:
  - What in God's name... ?
  ans:
  - Bob...

- que:
  - What's wrong with your face?
  ans:
  - Allright. Calm down.

- que:
  - What was the file name?
  ans:
  - K-R-O-one.

- que:
  - Why, Beckett?
  ans:
  - Because they deserve to, Walter.

- que:
  - What's that on your forehead, pal?
  ans:
  - Whacked with a racquetball. I appreciate your faith in my abilities.

- que:
  - This time. What about next time?
  ans:
  - There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.

- que:
  - Really? Who thinks that, sir?
  ans:
  - Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.

- que:
  - Aren't you giving an exam?
  ans:
  - I said, don't worry about it.

- que:
  - So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
  ans:
  - It could be parasites, an infection...

- que:
  - That's the third time. I better call the office. Would you relax, please?
  ans:
  - I am relaxed.

- que:
  - Why are you getting dressed?
  ans:
  - You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...

- que:
  - You got that right, Mikey... You still believe that, don't you?
  ans:
  - Close the law book.

- que:
  - You don't think there's much time left, do you?
  ans:
  - That's not what I said.

- que:
  - I'm ready...
  ans:
  - You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims?

- que:
  - Ready for what, baby?
  ans:
  - Whatever.

- que:
  - If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
  ans:
  - I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.

- que:
  - About my blood work?
  ans:
  - We're waiting...

- que:
  - Innocuous?
  ans:
  - Funny.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
  ans:
  - I have AIDS.

- que:
  - It's okay. Can I sit down?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah.

- que:
  - New baby?
  ans:
  - One week old.

- que:
  - Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.

- que:
  - You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
  ans:
  - Correct. I'm seeking representation.

- que:
  - How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
  ans:
  - Nine.

- que:
  - We?
  ans:
  - My lover and I.

- que:
  - Your... lover?
  ans:
  - Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.

- que:
  - Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
  ans:
  - Makeup.

- que:
  - As in, the vegetable?
  ans:
  - The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...

- que:
  - Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - Rayisha. Very nice.

- que:
  - How did they find out?
  ans:
  - One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.

- que:
  - They didn't fire her?
  ans:
  - No. They didn't fire her.

- que:
  - Arline?
  ans:
  - One more thing, Your Honor...

- que:
  - Get it?
  ans:
  - Let's find you a drink.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.

- que:
  - Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
  ans:
  - Sure. It's fine.

- que:
  - No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Do you... pray?
  ans:
  - Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...

- que:
  - What have you prayed for?
  ans:
  - For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.

- que:
  - What happens?
  ans:
  - We proceed, representing your estate.

- que:
  - Opera?
  ans:
  - I'll look over the Q and A.

- que:
  - What impressed you about him?
  ans:
  - He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.

- que:
  - What kind of person is that?
  ans:
  - Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.

- que:
  - A regular all-American guy?
  ans:
  - I suppose you could say that.

- que:
  - Except... you were gay?
  ans:
  - I still am.

- que:
  - In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
  ans:
  - No. I didn't.

- que:
  - Are you a good lawyer?
  ans:
  - I'm an excellent lawyer.

- que:
  - What makes you an excellent lawyer?
  ans:
  - I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.

- que:
  - Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A good start.

- que:
  - It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome. Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
  ans:
  - I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.

- que:
  - What can I do?
  ans:
  - Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.

- que:
  - You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had \"an adventurous spirit.\" Is that correct?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Do you take risks?
  ans:
  - In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.

- que:
  - In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
  ans:
  - Not unnecessary ones.

- que:
  - What kind of movies do they show there?
  ans:
  - Gay movies.

- que:
  - Gay pornographic movies?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
  ans:
  - I guess it was 1984, 85.

- que:
  - But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
  ans:
  - That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.

- que:
  - You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?
  ans:
  - I'd heard of something. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.

- que:
  - Do you need a break?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
  ans:
  - That is not correct. I never lied about it.

- que:
  - Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
  ans:
  - Some do. I didn't.

- que:
  - As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
  ans:
  - In some situations.

- que:
  - You could have infected him, isn't that right?
  ans:
  - Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
  ans:
  - One. Here, in front of my ear.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hi, Mom. It's me.

- que:
  - Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - What's Dr. Gillman say?
  ans:
  - Hold on, Mom. There's no way my client will go along with that.

- que:
  - Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
  ans:
  - Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.

- que:
  - Where's Dad?
  ans:
  - He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.

- que:
  - Thanks, Mom... Dad?
  ans:
  - Objection.

- que:
  - Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Were you recently promoted?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.

- que:
  - No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - In what way?
  ans:
  - Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.

- que:
  - I'm not worried. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.

- que:
  - Why are we going to do that?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.

- que:
  - Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
  ans:
  - Wyant Wheeler represented us.

- que:
  - Were you pleased with his work?
  ans:
  - We were satisfied.

- que:
  - Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old, Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
  ans:
  - We won.

- que:
  - Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
  ans:
  - It satisfied me.

- que:
  - What kind of people?
  ans:
  - People who want to bend the rules...

- que:
  - Good school. What year?
  ans:
  - Second.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
  ans:
  - Do I look gay to you? Relax.

- que:
  - Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
  ans:
  - Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? Asshole.

- que:
  - How many do you know?
  ans:
  - Lots.

- que:
  - Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... lesbian?
  ans:
  - Duh...

- que:
  - Since when?
  ans:
  - Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.

- que:
  - Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
  ans:
  - My lettuce is wilting.

- que:
  - Yeah. Do I have a case?
  ans:
  - Now that you mention it...

- que:
  - A trial takes time, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
  ans:
  - Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.

- que:
  - Any women on board?
  ans:
  - Not when I was in the Navy.

- que:
  - Going on... like...?
  ans:
  - Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.

- que:
  - How did you do that?
  ans:
  - We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.

- que:
  - Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson?
  ans:
  - She didn't try to conceal it.

- que:
  - So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
  ans:
  - I know the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.

- que:
  - Attorney for the plaintiff?
  ans:
  - Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.

- que:
  - On behalf of the defendants?
  ans:
  - If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this matter.

- que:
  - With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
  ans:
  - No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.

- que:
  - It's good to be King, hey Charles?
  ans:
  - Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant. It's an anti-trust action.

- que:
  - Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately, A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
  ans:
  - Helloooo...

- que:
  - Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
  ans:
  - You'll be sorry, Beckett.

- que:
  - You have to make a decision, is this guy partner material?
  ans:
  - Jesus.

- que:
  - What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
  ans:
  - Charles...

- que:
  - ... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
  ans:
  - No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.

- que:
  - You came for us....
  ans:
  - What? What is it?

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
  ans:
  - Probably okay to talk to me now.

- que:
  - Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'?
  ans:
  - Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Tell me that was you.

- que:
  - Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
  ans:
  - Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.

- que:
  - You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

- que:
  - Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
  ans:
  - I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....

- que:
  - What whispers?
  ans:
  - All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.

- que:
  - I got the quick-and-ugly version.
  ans:
  - You did this? To yourself?

- que:
  - An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
  ans:
  - Entered our minds.

- que:
  - Why, what'd you hear?
  ans:
  - Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --

- que:
  - We can, can't we? Trust you?
  ans:
  - Actually... That's what I been askin' myself.

- que:
  - Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
  ans:
  - Saw something I didn't like.

- que:
  - What do you see? Riddick?
  ans:
  - Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.

- que:
  - Back to the ship, huh?
  ans:
  - Get out of our way.

- que:
  - How many you see?
  ans:
  - One or two.

- que:
  - Audrey?
  ans:
  - We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

- que:
  - What, you're afraid?
  ans:
  - I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.

- que:
  - You'd die for them?
  ans:
  - I would try for them.

- que:
  - What do my eyes see?
  ans:
  - It's starting....

- que:
  - Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
  ans:
  - Possibly.

- que:
  - Hey.
  ans:
  - Can we switch?

- que:
  - Hey, who?
  ans:
  - Hey, me. Over here.

- que:
  - I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
  ans:
  - Only around humans.

- que:
  - S'matter?
  ans:
  - Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Tell me it's not a mirage.

- que:
  - What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
  ans:
  - Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like my pistola.

- que:
  - He used that?
  ans:
  - Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

- que:
  - So why isn't it all bloody?
  ans:
  - Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.

- que:
  - What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
  ans:
  - You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.

- que:
  - 60 years ago.
  ans:
  - 25 kilos each, huh?

- que:
  - He can pilot?
  ans:
  - Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

- que:
  - We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
  ans:
  - You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?

- que:
  - Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
  ans:
  - Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.

- que:
  - Smoke screen for what?
  ans:
  - For your own fear.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - 79 kilos.

- que:
  - He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - We're just burnin' light here.

- que:
  - So you noticed too?
  ans:
  - -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we are disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.

- que:
  - So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
  ans:
  - Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

- que:
  - Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
  ans:
  - Well? Is it just the pump?

- que:
  - What, you're goin' off, too?
  ans:
  - Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.

- que:
  - He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
  ans:
  - You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

- que:
  - Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. I'm Owens. Right?
  ans:
  - 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us.

- que:
  - Fry?
  ans:
  - Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....

- que:
  - So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
  ans:
  - You mean that \"load\" of passengers?

- que:
  - Some prophet guy?
  ans:
  - \"Some prophet guy.\" And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.

- que:
  - You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
  ans:
  - Frightening thought.

- que:
  - One is all?
  ans:
  - For now.

- que:
  - Riddick?
  ans:
  - They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.

- que:
  - And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. But he can.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.

- que:
  - And what about the cells?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. No, no, no....

- que:
  - Which half?
  ans:
  - You mean....

- que:
  - What're you doin'?
  ans:
  - Blessing you like the others. It's painless.

- que:
  - Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
  ans:
  - It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.

- que:
  - For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
  ans:
  - All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.

- que:
  - \"God is Great,\" yes?
  ans:
  - ...then we saw this.

- que:
  - Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
  ans:
  - King Tut's tomb....

- que:
  - What the hell are these?
  ans:
  - Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.

- que:
  - Like an emergency life-raft, right?
  ans:
  - Very big beads.

- que:
  - Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
  ans:
  - We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

- que:
  - For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
  ans:
  - Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.

- que:
  - You'd cut me loose, Boss?
  ans:
  - Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.

- que:
  - Not afraid of the dark, are you?
  ans:
  - I'd rather piss glass.

- que:
  - Wanna rag your fat mouth?
  ans:
  - Think about that reward, Johns.

- que:
  - Well, what's it look like now?
  ans:
  - Looks clear.

- que:
  - Ain't all of us gonna make it.
  ans:
  - About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

- que:
  - Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
  ans:
  - Not if I'm the one.

- que:
  - What if you're one of five?
  ans:
  - Kept calling it \"murder\" when I did it.

- que:
  - So which one caught your eye?
  ans:
  - Don' look, don' look, don' look....

- que:
  - What do you care?
  ans:
  - Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.

- que:
  - What's one more to you? Like this is the one that sends you to Hell?
  ans:
  - Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.

- que:
  - An' this?
  ans:
  - Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's extinct.

- que:
  - Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
  ans:
  - So much for your nightfall.

- que:
  - What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
  ans:
  - Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.

- que:
  - What, it's broken?
  ans:
  - Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.

- que:
  - You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
  ans:
  - Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.

- que:
  - How did you know we'd come here?
  ans:
  - I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.

- que:
  - Seal the cave?
  ans:
  - That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.

- que:
  - Do you have any weapons?
  ans:
  - The best. But we won't need them.

- que:
  - It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
  ans:
  - Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.

- que:
  - Where does the river lead?
  ans:
  - It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.

- que:
  - When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
  ans:
  - Right now, if you like.

- que:
  - Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
  ans:
  - That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.

- que:
  - Do you have to work tonight?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
  ans:
  - Look -- she remembers.

- que:
  - Remembers what?
  ans:
  - The blood transfusion.

- que:
  - Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?' I don't know.
  ans:
  - Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?

- que:
  - And they fell out of the sky with you?
  ans:
  - Flight is a scientific impossibility.

- que:
  - Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
  ans:
  - No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.

- que:
  - Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
  ans:
  - Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

- que:
  - How did it go?
  ans:
  - There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.

- que:
  - One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9. We've enough food and water for three days.
  ans:
  - Got your sensors?

- que:
  - But how long is a day?
  ans:
  - Good question. Landon -- check your communications kit.

- que:
  - Any sign of dangerous ionization?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Which direction?
  ans:
  - That way.

- que:
  - Any particular reason?
  ans:
  - None at all.

- que:
  - Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
  ans:
  - Him.

- que:
  - Will he live?
  ans:
  - I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.

- que:
  - But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
  ans:
  - What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.

- que:
  - Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
  ans:
  - State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.

- que:
  - Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
  ans:
  - I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

- que:
  - Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
  ans:
  - No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.

- que:
  - Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - He's trying to form words.

- que:
  - Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
  ans:
  - I'll see.

- que:
  - We're here to stay.
  ans:
  - What signal?

- que:
  - Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
  ans:
  - Landon! Join the expedition.

- que:
  - Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
  ans:
  - Air leak. Died in her sleep.

- que:
  - Scarecrows?
  ans:
  - Let's take a look.

- que:
  - Can we take a dip?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Fine. Just let her out.
  ans:
  - Who are you?

- que:
  - Shouldn't we be moving on?
  ans:
  - I'm for that.

- que:
  - Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
  ans:
  - In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.

- que:
  - All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
  ans:
  - Not everything. They left a hostage. How do you feel, Lucius?

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.

- que:
  - They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
  ans:
  - I'll start by following the shoreline. And my nose.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed. Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with things like this.

- que:
  - Who put them up?
  ans:
  - The Hunt Club.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - A man, Dr. Maximus.

- que:
  - Why special?
  ans:
  - We're -- conducting a new experiment.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - With one of them.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You lied. Where is your tribe?
  ans:
  - My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.

- que:
  - A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured?
  ans:
  - I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.

- que:
  - Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
  ans:
  - I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?

- que:
  - When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
  ans:
  - Twelve hundred years ago.

- que:
  - Then there is another jungle?
  ans:
  - Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.

- que:
  - Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
  ans:
  - No, thanks. I'll take freedom.

- que:
  - There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
  ans:
  - Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - A hearing.

- que:
  - Which one?
  ans:
  - Second from the left.

- que:
  - You! ... You knew about this?
  ans:
  - No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.

- que:
  - Are you going to take her with you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You want her that much?
  ans:
  - You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.

- que:
  - What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
  ans:
  - She's not sick at all. She's pregnant.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's humiliating.

- que:
  - Would you like to come along?
  ans:
  - Yes, Sir.

- que:
  - Do you believe him?
  ans:
  - Like you, I find it difficult.

- que:
  - How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
  ans:
  - He doesn't know.

- que:
  - Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
  ans:
  - But there's the doll, sir.

- que:
  - But the proof? The doll?
  ans:
  - In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - ...but 'Lias is still out there.

- que:
  - He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.

- que:
  - How the hell did he get away?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.

- que:
  - So what's the problem?
  ans:
  - Says he can't walk.

- que:
  - Sarge?
  ans:
  - Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.

- que:
  - Yeah, what is it?
  ans:
  - I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that...

- que:
  - Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
  ans:
  - ...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.

- que:
  - You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
  ans:
  - Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Barnes comes from Hell.

- que:
  - Does he have a metal plate in his head?
  ans:
  - You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.

- que:
  - Where's Elias come from?
  ans:
  - Lias come naturally.

- que:
  - First time?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Feel good?
  ans:
  - Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.

- que:
  - But what'd she actually do?
  ans:
  - She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.

- que:
  - Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
  ans:
  - Barnes believes in what he's doing.

- que:
  - And you, do you believe?
  ans:
  - In '65 - yeah. Now... No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...

- que:
  - You really think so... us?
  ans:
  - Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...

- que:
  - Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
  ans:
  - I'll go with you.

- que:
  - What you got there - beers?
  ans:
  - Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway. Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.

- que:
  - You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
  ans:
  - Nah...

- que:
  - What are the heads?
  ans:
  - ...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...

- que:
  - You volunteered for this shit man?
  ans:
  - You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.

- que:
  - What we got here a crusader?
  ans:
  - Sounds like it.

- que:
  - Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
  ans:
  - This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...

- que:
  - Whew! - where that come from?
  ans:
  - Found it. Growing in a garden.

- que:
  - You wanted to see me sir?
  ans:
  - Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.

- que:
  - You don't want to hear about it?
  ans:
  - That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.

- que:
  - How far does this train go?
  ans:
  - Vancouver, B.C.

- que:
  - Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
  ans:
  - I'll make one for you. I live there.

- que:
  - A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
  ans:
  - I really don't know.

- que:
  - Indefinitely?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - No thanks?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
  ans:
  - I'm supposing.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

- que:
  - Not tonight.
  ans:
  - Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.

- que:
  - The brush-off, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.

- que:
  - Would you mind?
  ans:
  - Okay. You win.

- que:
  - How do you do?
  ans:
  - I think I'd like to dance.

- que:
  - How careful should I be?
  ans:
  - Maybe you're going to have to like me.

- que:
  - What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
  ans:
  - Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell... ..don't. I'm warning you.

- que:
  - How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.

- que:
  - Immigration Officer?
  ans:
  - They might think I was running away from something.

- que:
  - I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?
  ans:
  - I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.

- que:
  - Bank?
  ans:
  - Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.

- que:
  - I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
  ans:
  - You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.

- que:
  - What did you say his name was?
  ans:
  - You don't sound as if you liked him very much.

- que:
  - Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.

- que:
  - No. Are you really going to drink that stuff?
  ans:
  - You're drinking it.

- que:
  - Would it make you anymore amusing?
  ans:
  - Whatever you say.

- que:
  - Do you think I don't?
  ans:
  - Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.

- que:
  - You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
  ans:
  - He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.

- que:
  - Dance?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - He got in here how?
  ans:
  - Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.

- que:
  - No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
  ans:
  - Sure... but somebody always does..

- que:
  - How did you meet him?
  ans:
  - On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.

- que:
  - He was a great boy for that. What else?
  ans:
  - That's all there is.

- que:
  - Want a spike in it?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Bad?
  ans:
  - Bad enough.

- que:
  - Quarter after one. Why?
  ans:
  - There's a lot of night left to live through.

- que:
  - Dance? Tonight?
  ans:
  - Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.

- que:
  - Just who are you, anyway?
  ans:
  - You, too? My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.

- que:
  - Is this the best you can do?
  ans:
  - At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Absolutely sure.

- que:
  - You don't know who he is?
  ans:
  - He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.

- que:
  - Us?
  ans:
  - All right--following me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.

- que:
  - Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
  ans:
  - Try not talking.

- que:
  - It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
  ans:
  - Nothing matters.

- que:
  - I don't think that's on the market anymore. I'd like something much closer to the water.
  ans:
  - It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?

- que:
  - Cant be too close for me. Right across the street from it suits me. Anything else listed?
  ans:
  - There's another man--right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before.

- que:
  - Yes. I've never been very far from it, for a long time. Will you do something for me?
  ans:
  - Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.

- que:
  - How bad is the other thing? The secret?
  ans:
  - They'll look for you.

- que:
  - But that's what I'm doing. Couldn't they think of that?
  ans:
  - Killaine...

- que:
  - Do you have to leave the note?
  ans:
  - It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - You leave it.

- que:
  - See anything?
  ans:
  - I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.

- que:
  - Cold?
  ans:
  - Frozen.

- que:
  - Wonder what?
  ans:
  - If you're doing all this just for me.

- que:
  - I guess I'm a little screwy. Maybe I could believe it. Should I try?
  ans:
  - So that I will never be found.

- que:
  - Mine?
  ans:
  - Mitchell was dead enough.

- que:
  - Who'd believe it but you? I took him out to sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
  ans:
  - Magruder does.

- que:
  - This is it, Betty. They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
  ans:
  - Would I want to?

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yes. You. You're not really a murderer yet.

- que:
  - Do you think I was faking?
  ans:
  - If I did-I don't-now.

- que:
  - Beer or ale, Miss?
  ans:
  - Ale. I don't mind.

- que:
  - Who told you I was married?
  ans:
  - There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.

- que:
  - Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
  ans:
  - Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.

- que:
  - What this?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where's you get it?
  ans:
  - A graduation present.

- que:
  - They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
  ans:
  - Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.

- que:
  - FLorida?
  ans:
  - I've never been to Florida.

- que:
  - Who hasn't--one way or another?
  ans:
  - But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.

- que:
  - We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons. Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
  ans:
  - You were there when I last saw him.

- que:
  - The police always do, don't they?
  ans:
  - You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.

- que:
  - You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
  ans:
  - We try to be decent.

- que:
  - You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
  ans:
  - Nobody can help me. You, least of all.

- que:
  - Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
  ans:
  - Very ridiculous.

- que:
  - What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
  ans:
  - They call me Jeff.

- que:
  - Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
  ans:
  - Looking for peanuts, I suppose.

- que:
  - Because you think your in love with me?
  ans:
  - You've got a couple of hours, maybe.

- que:
  - To do what?
  ans:
  - I can't answer that.

- que:
  - That's they're business. Can I drop you somewhere?
  ans:
  - You're still a police officer, Jeff. I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.

- que:
  - You do things the hard way, don't you?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - Morning. Any calls?
  ans:
  - Mr. Reed would like you to call him.

- que:
  - Who's Goble?
  ans:
  - Mr. Reed, please, for Mr. Brandon. Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now. Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr. Brandon.

- que:
  - I'm still asking. What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.

- que:
  - What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
  ans:
  - Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.

- que:
  - That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
  ans:
  - Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.

- que:
  - For five hundred, what do I get?
  ans:
  - I go home and paint the kitchen.

- que:
  - For two hundred?
  ans:
  - I stick around and wait for the five hundred.

- que:
  - Got the information on you?
  ans:
  - I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.

- que:
  - Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
  ans:
  - In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.

- que:
  - What'll you have, Margo?
  ans:
  - Martini.

- que:
  - You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly. How long do we have to wait for this police character?
  ans:
  - Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.

- que:
  - That comedian?
  ans:
  - All right, let's see the buzzer.

- que:
  - What's a buzzer?
  ans:
  - So you're not a cop.

- que:
  - Who told you my name?
  ans:
  - I've got good ears.

- que:
  - How are your teeth getting along?
  ans:
  - The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.

- que:
  - What's this in favor of?
  ans:
  - I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A private joke.

- que:
  - How's life treating you?
  ans:
  - The usual grind.

- que:
  - Round of golf Saturday?
  ans:
  - If I can get off.

- que:
  - Hardly. Who's the girl?
  ans:
  - Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.

- que:
  - Quite sure you had no motive?
  ans:
  - Could be.

- que:
  - I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - It was lying where on the balcony?
  ans:
  - Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.

- que:
  - How are you two getting along?
  ans:
  - In case you want to have us followed.

- que:
  - If it doesn't take too long. Drink?
  ans:
  - Thanks. I don't mind.

- que:
  - Thanks. Lovely view you have, haven't you?
  ans:
  - I never notice the view after the first week.

- que:
  - I would. Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap. Wonderful thing, money is. Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know.

- que:
  - Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield. How long since you saw her?
  ans:
  - You'd be breaking the law.

- que:
  - You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up?
  ans:
  - Information.

- que:
  - Your concentrating too hard, Killaine. What about Margo West? She had a motive. I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
  ans:
  - And old man Clarendon? He had a motive, too. Margo and her money.

- que:
  - How could Mitchell? After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
  ans:
  - She didn't have to. He could have climbed down from here.

- que:
  - You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
  ans:
  - No idea.

- que:
  - You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
  ans:
  - Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.

- que:
  - Where did it all come from? Or is that a permissible question?
  ans:
  - I had a father who knew how to steal.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You asked me where it all came from.

- que:
  - Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
  ans:
  - The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.

- que:
  - Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
  ans:
  - Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.

- que:
  - Did I do something wrong?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.

- que:
  - Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
  ans:
  - You don't throw guests out, Brandon.

- que:
  - A little something on account perhaps?
  ans:
  - Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I don't think you locked your door.

- que:
  - Passkey?
  ans:
  - Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.

- que:
  - Convenient, isn't it?
  ans:
  - One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.

- que:
  - With what motive?
  ans:
  - Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.

- que:
  - Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..

- que:
  - Floater?
  ans:
  - Not a floater. Only just dead.

- que:
  - Got a moment, Inspector?
  ans:
  - I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.

- que:
  - Would you?
  ans:
  - If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.

- que:
  - Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
  ans:
  - Men like you don't need orders.

- que:
  - What's the face for, Driscoll?
  ans:
  - We don't need him.

- que:
  - The joint's not open, Mac. Who's Brandon?
  ans:
  - I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.

- que:
  - Mr. Brandon couldn't be here. He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
  ans:
  - One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed. Not too fat- not too thin.

- que:
  - What do I get for it?
  ans:
  - You get it's brother.

- que:
  - You in charge here?
  ans:
  - So it seems Sergeant.

- que:
  - So the shell ought to have gone over?
  ans:
  - Unless the gun was slanted up.

- que:
  - There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
  ans:
  - Not too hard, is it?

- que:
  - Was that about the right angle?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Where's the shell?
  ans:
  - Should be over there.

- que:
  - You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder. What are you going to do about it?
  ans:
  - If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.

- que:
  - Do I know who lives down there?
  ans:
  - You can find out.

- que:
  - Do I know that she's out of the room? Likely to be out of it for some time?
  ans:
  - You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.

- que:
  - Pretty big chance, huh?
  ans:
  - You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon.

- que:
  - Did we ever really think it was suicide?
  ans:
  - And a motive--which we haven't got. So this could all be a dream.

- que:
  - Oh, the Coldstream Guards. Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
  ans:
  - I never wear a hat. Oh, so I am. I forgot. I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.

- que:
  - May you what?
  ans:
  - Oh nothing.

- que:
  - Are you always this witty?
  ans:
  - Scotch and plain water, I think.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - Not quiet yet.

- que:
  - I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
  ans:
  - Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.

- que:
  - Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
  ans:
  - I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.

- que:
  - Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West. Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
  ans:
  - How did you know? Clarendon. You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.

- que:
  - You didn't play it for laughs last night.
  ans:
  - That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?

- que:
  - Did you ever have a serious operation?
  ans:
  - Mortar shells are not funny, either.

- que:
  - Now, you're being beastly.
  ans:
  - It does. May I go now?

- que:
  - And if you didn't believe me?
  ans:
  - I'm interested in who handled it.

- que:
  - How about Magruder?
  ans:
  - He checks too.

- que:
  - Mayfield? She fit into this?
  ans:
  - She might.

- que:
  - The card says so, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Brandon handled the money envelope.

- que:
  - I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point. Now about this Mayfield girl?
  ans:
  - She's a suspect, naturally. But not the only one.

- que:
  - Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
  ans:
  - A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.

- que:
  - It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine. Where's the girl now?
  ans:
  - I don't know, sir.

- que:
  - Well, find out. Who's covering her?
  ans:
  - Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.

- que:
  - Ye have, have ye?
  ans:
  - We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles. Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.

- que:
  - And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
  ans:
  - So-so.

- que:
  - Who's the girl?
  ans:
  - Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.

- que:
  - Why should I mind?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.

- que:
  - Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
  ans:
  - You ought to know why.

- que:
  - You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
  ans:
  - I have a rough idea.

- que:
  - What'll we do about it, Margo?
  ans:
  - I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.

- que:
  - Years, why?
  ans:
  - It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.

- que:
  - Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - How about your new friend?
  ans:
  - I told you she's just..

- que:
  - A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again. Be back in an hour. Right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - He's a little unhappy. I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - My husband apologises for not joining us. It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
  ans:
  - It's fine, thank you.

- que:
  - Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.

- que:
  - Shall we go?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What went wrong?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - That doesn't matter. As long as we can get our message through to someone there. Jill, where are those handouts?
  ans:
  - Very good.

- que:
  - Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure I can face it.

- que:
  - How's Mary?
  ans:
  - She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over.

- que:
  - No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
  ans:
  - Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions. I can't talk about it.

- que:
  - Attributed?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary? Who was the old one anyway?
  ans:
  - It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news. He needs a poet's advice.

- que:
  - Congratulations. Who with?
  ans:
  - A glamorous young lady way above his station...

- que:
  - Are you going to have coffee?
  ans:
  - Yes, please.

- que:
  - And you'll join me in a sambucca?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Can I give you a lift?
  ans:
  - No, it's all right. I can get a cab. Night night.

- que:
  - What did you think of that Wadja film?
  ans:
  - I quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.

- que:
  - Too bad. What did your father do?
  ans:
  - My real father? Well, he was a flashback.

- que:
  - Oh yes?
  ans:
  - How nice.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I called you a taxi.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - Yes, if you like. Call me at work.

- que:
  - Why not stay?
  ans:
  - I have to be up early.

- que:
  - I think we're ready now, thank you. And how was Norfolk? Did you get on with my mother?
  ans:
  - I think she liked me.

- que:
  - Did she talk about me?
  ans:
  - No. We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.

- que:
  - Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
  ans:
  - I haven't really thought about it.

- que:
  - Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I might.

- que:
  - Might?
  ans:
  - He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.

- que:
  - Shall we have a drink or something?
  ans:
  - Oh ... excuse me. There's Nicholas.

- que:
  - Not yet you know any of these people?
  ans:
  - Nonsense.

- que:
  - You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
  ans:
  - No need to thank me, if you don't want to. Just pay for these drinks.

- que:
  - Hold those rights.
  ans:
  - What have you been up to?

- que:
  - Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton. Perhaps you should come too.

- que:
  - Will it be fun?
  ans:
  - Perhaps I will, then.

- que:
  - Still in love?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Six onion bajees! Great girl. Did you shake the mother off?
  ans:
  - Yes, finally.

- que:
  - Are you up to something?
  ans:
  - Susan and I are very old friends, James.

- que:
  - Why not sit down and wait?
  ans:
  - Okay, I will.

- que:
  - Have you come to talk about me?
  ans:
  - Not at all. History.

- que:
  - What period?
  ans:
  - Suez. 1956.

- que:
  - Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - What about the Cromwells?
  ans:
  - They don't count.

- que:
  - So how is she?
  ans:
  - Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. She keeps asking when you're coming...

- que:
  - Now, are you going to have some more tea?
  ans:
  - No, thanks Dad.

- que:
  - What would you call it?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch.

- que:
  - She said that?
  ans:
  - You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.

- que:
  - And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.

- que:
  - What have you got there?
  ans:
  - You'd look naked without one.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - Promise.

- que:
  - Don't you want to walk, Tom?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And that's why you never went pro?
  ans:
  - Two years of surgery. I missed my window. Limped through law school instead.

- que:
  - Mmm. A lawyer, huh? Too bad. But at least you're surfing now. So your life's not over yet, right?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - You always talk like this? You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
  ans:
  - No. So I was up the beach. I saw it going down. you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Come with Tyler. She knows.

- que:
  - Don't you gamble?
  ans:
  - Only make bets I can't afford to lose. Only way to be 100% committed.

- que:
  - So what's the biggest? Waimea?
  ans:
  - No, Bells Beach, Australia.

- que:
  - Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
  ans:
  - Football's a man-made game. You keep score with numbers. But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. Just you and the wave.

- que:
  - How you figure?
  ans:
  - One shot stopping.

- que:
  - Ever done this before?
  ans:
  - Once.

- que:
  - I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
  ans:
  - You gotta earn trust.

- que:
  - I'll take that as a yes.
  ans:
  - We gonna jump or jerk off?

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Insurance policy. Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah. Press play.

- que:
  - Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
  ans:
  - I'm not armed.

- que:
  - Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - You gotta tell me where she is.

- que:
  - I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
  ans:
  - Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why don't you pull it?

- que:
  - Yeah? What?
  ans:
  - Have you seen a little dog? Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. About this big.

- que:
  - Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
  ans:
  - There's nobody else here...

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I take the skin off chicken.

- que:
  - How was the beach?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Surf conditions okay?
  ans:
  - A little mushy.

- que:
  - A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
  ans:
  - Babes.

- que:
  - Three men dead. One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
  ans:
  - Take your hand off my shoulder right now.

- que:
  - What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
  ans:
  - Cole and Munoz. I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.

- que:
  - The shit they pull, huh?
  ans:
  - Pappas. Angelo Pappas.

- que:
  - They don't go for the vault?
  ans:
  - Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.

- que:
  - Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
  ans:
  - So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.

- que:
  - Yeah. What's your theory?
  ans:
  - The fucking punks are surfers.

- que:
  - Sex wax? You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
  ans:
  - Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.

- que:
  - Got it...
  ans:
  - It's all balance, right? And coordination. How hard can it be?

- que:
  - What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
  ans:
  - Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.

- que:
  - Big zippo so far. How about you?
  ans:
  - Patience hotshot. Patience. It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.

- que:
  - Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, Dad.

- que:
  - When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
  ans:
  - He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.

- que:
  - Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
  ans:
  - Right here, partner.

- que:
  - I'm ready to rock, Angelo. Where you want me?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - Nothing?
  ans:
  - Shrimp and fries.

- que:
  - Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
  ans:
  - I'm serious.

- que:
  - Stop here. Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Who's the girl?
  ans:
  - Catch of the day.

- que:
  - What's goin' on?
  ans:
  - Swell's here, Johnny. Bodhi always knows.

- que:
  - You had enough?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling.

- que:
  - Johnny... what's going on? I don't get it... did I do something?
  ans:
  - No. I'm sorry. I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - So what'd the other guy look like?
  ans:
  - Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.

- que:
  - But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
  ans:
  - Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.

- que:
  - Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Something... in the trees...

- que:
  - You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
  ans:
  - No way, old buddy.

- que:
  - Who's our back-up on this?
  ans:
  - No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

- que:
  - Mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.

- que:
  - I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
  ans:
  - Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.

- que:
  - Why us?
  ans:
  - Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.

- que:
  - What story did you give to Davis?
  ans:
  - She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.

- que:
  - The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
  ans:
  - We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.

- que:
  - What the hell do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - We're going to need everyone.

- que:
  - Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
  ans:
  - No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.

- que:
  - What, Sergeant?
  ans:
  - Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...

- que:
  - You saw what?
  ans:
  - I saw it.

- que:
  - What's that, General?
  ans:
  - Someone else will be going in with you.

- que:
  - Mmmnnn...?
  ans:
  - I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...

- que:
  - What's he got?
  ans:
  - Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...

- que:
  - Hawkins?
  ans:
  - I can't tell.

- que:
  - What in God's name...?
  ans:
  - I think it's Hawkins.

- que:
  - Where the hell is his body?
  ans:
  - There's no sign of it.

- que:
  - How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
  ans:
  - He knows our defenses.

- que:
  - Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
  ans:
  - Georgia.

- que:
  - Thunder's a horse. Come on.
  ans:
  - I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?

- que:
  - Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am. This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Hope to be?
  ans:
  - It's... it's not like that.

- que:
  - What's that long building over there?
  ans:
  - I talked to some developers about the land.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished. You've won.

- que:
  - Who are you going after next, sir?
  ans:
  - Who indeed...

- que:
  - If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
  ans:
  - I... I would take advantage of it.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I... I don't know. There... there wasn't time...

- que:
  - This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
  ans:
  - You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.

- que:
  - What? You gonna tell me you're lost?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Great. What do I look like a tourguide?
  ans:
  - No, you look like a hooker.

- que:
  - Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
  ans:
  - Sure. For five bucks.

- que:
  - Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
  ans:
  - Sit... and spin.

- que:
  - Nice car. Yours?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Stolen?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - Mind if I turn on some heat?
  ans:
  - If you can figure it out, be my guest.

- que:
  - You're not from L.A., huh?
  ans:
  - New York.

- que:
  - What motel you staying at?
  ans:
  - Hotel.

- que:
  - Okay, what hotel?
  ans:
  - Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name's Vivian.

- que:
  - You like being a hooker, Vivian?
  ans:
  - It pays.

- que:
  - What do you charge for company, Vivian?
  ans:
  - Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.

- que:
  - For the whole night?
  ans:
  - For an hour.

- que:
  - Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
  ans:
  - You couldn't afford it.

- que:
  - You know how to drive a stick?
  ans:
  - Better believe it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.

- que:
  - Room service. What do you drink?
  ans:
  - Diet coke.

- que:
  - Can I have some chips?
  ans:
  - -- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.

- que:
  - Do you plan everything?
  ans:
  - Always.

- que:
  - Right. So! In town on business?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - And why do you say that?
  ans:
  - I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.

- que:
  - Where are they? Shopping together?
  ans:
  - They should be. They're both good at it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.

- que:
  - What do you like?
  ans:
  - If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred. Just lay back and let me drive.

- que:
  - Did you sleep well?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.

- que:
  - Where'd you go?
  ans:
  - I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night...

- que:
  - Do you ever... enjoy it?
  ans:
  - I like guys if that's what you're asking. Not that I trust'm.

- que:
  - No? Why's that?
  ans:
  - \"Occupational hazard\".

- que:
  - No shit. They expensive?
  ans:
  - The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.

- que:
  - So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
  ans:
  - I sell them.

- que:
  - Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit.
  ans:
  - What? Why?

- que:
  - Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
  ans:
  - Not... quite.

- que:
  - Where'd you learn to do this?
  ans:
  - Don't drown.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm in town until Saturday.

- que:
  - Five full nights... days too?
  ans:
  - Four thousand.

- que:
  - Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
  ans:
  - Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.

- que:
  - Did you buy some clothes?
  ans:
  - I got a dress, yeah.

- que:
  - Go by yourself then. Where you taking me anyway?
  ans:
  - The Rex.

- que:
  - Any good?
  ans:
  - I think you'll approve.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - I thought I told you not to answer the phone.

- que:
  - You're upset, huh?
  ans:
  - Upset. No. I never get upset about business.

- que:
  - Television?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. You don't have to use your brain at all.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works.

- que:
  - Was someone rude to you?
  ans:
  - Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.

- que:
  - Come with me?
  ans:
  - I thought maybe you'd like dinner.

- que:
  - What about dinner?
  ans:
  - Dinner can wait.

- que:
  - You always been rich?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
  ans:
  - Keep talkin'. I like hearin'.

- que:
  - You still mad at'm?
  ans:
  - He died a long time ago.

- que:
  - What id we run into someone I know?
  ans:
  - I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.

- que:
  - Shall we mingle?
  ans:
  - Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with. They're just into it for the money.

- que:
  - Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened.
  ans:
  - Ready to stomp sod?

- que:
  - Stuckey! He wants an \"appointment\" with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
  ans:
  - What was I supposed to do? I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent.

- que:
  - Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down?
  ans:
  - Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.

- que:
  - Do I look okay?
  ans:
  - Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...

- que:
  - What if I lose it?
  ans:
  - You won't.

- que:
  - What if someone tries to steal it?
  ans:
  - I'll guard them and you with my life.

- que:
  - Where are you taking me!?
  ans:
  - To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - The opera.

- que:
  - But don't they have it in English?
  ans:
  - Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know. That's the fun of it.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.

- que:
  - It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you liked him.

- que:
  - The young lady staying in your room?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - What's up, where you going?
  ans:
  - Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.

- que:
  - Cynthia's not coming?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car...
  ans:
  - Love this car! Is it new?

- que:
  - Oh, god, what?
  ans:
  - I'll bring it back.

- que:
  - Edward, did you hear me?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing his son. Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who's this girl you're taking?
  ans:
  - No one you know.

- que:
  - Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to fight?
  ans:
  - Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.

- que:
  - We're letting them slide?
  ans:
  - I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.

- que:
  - Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet?
  ans:
  - We just did.

- que:
  - And you just happened to run into her. Great. What's she do? She work?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - Vivian's in sales.

- que:
  - Why do you want to know?
  ans:
  - She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.

- que:
  - Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
  ans:
  - Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.

- que:
  - Did I wake you?
  ans:
  - I'm up.

- que:
  - He wouldn't say. Edward... I think we got him. His nuts are on the block and we got him. You there?
  ans:
  - Have a good day, gentlemen.

- que:
  - You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.

- que:
  - I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster. I wonder how much she made tonight?
  ans:
  - Don't be mad at me. I'll pay you back. I promise.

- que:
  - No, let's go to work. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay. I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.

- que:
  - Why'd he want you?
  ans:
  - He... he just does.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, Viv'. Carlos has been on my back. Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
  ans:
  - I'm getting dressed now. I'll be over. Bye.

- que:
  - In Beverly Hills?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Who did you think?
  ans:
  - Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks...

- que:
  - Where do you fit?
  ans:
  - I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.

- que:
  - Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
  ans:
  - It was great.

- que:
  - All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it. I don't know what to do. What do I do, Kit?
  ans:
  - Go for the bucks.

- que:
  - So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
  ans:
  - Get a job and probably go back to school. Figure out what I'm gonna be.

- que:
  - What kind of school?
  ans:
  - School, school. Regular. I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.

- que:
  - You sure you won't come with me?
  ans:
  - And leave all this? Not in a million.

- que:
  - Yeah, what?
  ans:
  - Rent. You're late.

- que:
  - You bullshittin' me?
  ans:
  - Of rent I do not bullshit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Housekeeping. I come to turn down the bed.

- que:
  - Is that all? You just fold back the bedspread?
  ans:
  - I also place las chocolates on the pillow.

- que:
  - Thanks! Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
  ans:
  - I'm just going to my room.

- que:
  - You're a guest here?
  ans:
  - I'm -- I'm with a friend.

- que:
  - And who is that?
  ans:
  - I... Edward...

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Vivian.

- que:
  - Niece?
  ans:
  - Of course. Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.

- que:
  - I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too. Wanna see?
  ans:
  - That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely.

- que:
  - Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner. The Rex. Ever been there?
  ans:
  - It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.

- que:
  - Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y'know, normal?
  ans:
  - I think you'll find it normal enough.

- que:
  - Will I like it?
  ans:
  - You'll like it fine.

- que:
  - What if they serve soup?
  ans:
  - They will serve salad.

- que:
  - But what if they serve soup?
  ans:
  - Then you use your soup spoon.

- que:
  - Professionally?
  ans:
  - Barnard Thomas here. Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk. There's someone here to see you.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.

- que:
  - You're not accompanying him to New York?
  ans:
  - Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world. You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.

- que:
  - May I help you?
  ans:
  - I'm just looking, thanks.

- que:
  - Are you looking for something in particular?
  ans:
  - Yes. Something... conservative.

- que:
  - You have beautiful things. How much is this?
  ans:
  - I don't think it would fit you.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I'm going to spend money.

- que:
  - Would you like to try it on?
  ans:
  - Scume me.

- que:
  - Do you remember me?
  ans:
  - No, I'm sorry, I don't.

- que:
  - Having a good time, Vivian?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Thanks.

- que:
  - Then I'm here till I die?
  ans:
  - Till they kill you. Yeah.

- que:
  - Then why bother curing me?
  ans:
  - The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

- que:
  - If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
  ans:
  - May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.

- que:
  - Should I be?
  ans:
  - Brides often are, I'm told.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - BLACK I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.

- que:
  - BLACK You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
  ans:
  - He knows I do not love him.

- que:
  - BLACK With pride. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.

- que:
  - BLACK Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
  ans:
  - Nothing you can say will upset me.

- que:
  - BLACK ... as ... you ... wish...
  ans:
  - And what am I?

- que:
  - Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
  ans:
  - Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.

- que:
  - But what if something happens to you?
  ans:
  - Hear this now, I will come for you.

- que:
  - Can you move at all?
  ans:
  - Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.

- que:
  - I told you, \"I would always come for you.\" Why didn't you wait for me?
  ans:
  - Well ... you were dead.

- que:
  - Singed a bit, were you?
  ans:
  - You? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58.

- que:
  - But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
  ans:
  - I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59.

- que:
  - Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
  ans:
  - Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...

- que:
  - Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me?
  ans:
  - I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.

- que:
  - Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
  ans:
  - I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.

- que:
  - BLACK I believe you -- So what happens now?
  ans:
  - We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.

- que:
  - BLACK You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
  ans:
  - I could kill you now.

- que:
  - BLACK Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
  ans:
  - I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.

- que:
  - BLACK Why should that make such a difference?
  ans:
  - Well ... ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.

- que:
  - No more rhymes now, I mean it.
  ans:
  - Who's Guilder?

- que:
  - Anybody want a peanut?
  ans:
  - I only dog paddle.

- que:
  - What do I do?
  ans:
  - Finish him, finish him. Your way.

- que:
  - Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way?
  ans:
  - Probably he means no harm.

- que:
  - FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
  ans:
  - If there are, we'll all be dead.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.

- que:
  - How many could you handle?
  ans:
  - To find the Man in Black, obviously.

- que:
  - Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
  ans:
  - The Man in Black?

- que:
  - Have you any money?
  ans:
  - I have a little.

- que:
  - Has it been fifteen minutes?
  ans:
  - We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

- que:
  - How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
  ans:
  - You've been mostly dead all day.

- que:
  - Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
  ans:
  - Over the Albino, I think.

- que:
  - Where did you get that?
  ans:
  - At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I hope we win...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Open it up.

- que:
  - Has it got any sports in it?
  ans:
  - It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.

- que:
  - They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
  ans:
  - -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

- que:
  - Who gets Humperdinck?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
  ans:
  - Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90.

- que:
  - No! I'm okay. I'm okay. -- sit down. All right?
  ans:
  - Okay. All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.

- que:
  - What? What?
  ans:
  - No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.

- que:
  - Could this be a trap?
  ans:
  - I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.

- que:
  - I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. You returned this Westley to his ship?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And our assets?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Light him.

- que:
  - Where's Fezzik?
  ans:
  - I thought he was with you.

- que:
  - Hah?
  ans:
  - We're really in a terrible rush.

- que:
  - Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
  ans:
  - Sixty-five.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.

- que:
  - Slow going?
  ans:
  - BLACK Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.

- que:
  - I do not suppose you could speed things up?
  ans:
  - BLACK That does put a damper on our relationship.

- que:
  - You don't know any way you'll trust me?
  ans:
  - BLACK Nothing comes to mind.

- que:
  - BLACK You've done nothing but study swordplay?
  ans:
  - BLACK Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.

- que:
  - You are ready, then?
  ans:
  - BLACK Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30.

- que:
  - BLACK Then why are you smiling?
  ans:
  - Because I know something you don't know.

- que:
  - BLACK And what is that?
  ans:
  - No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.

- que:
  - I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Let me put it this way, have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
  ans:
  - BLACK Yes.

- que:
  - For the Princess?
  ans:
  - I accept.

- que:
  - Wait till I get going! Where was I?
  ans:
  - An hour.

- que:
  - Bye.
  ans:
  - Think it'll work?

- que:
  - You feeling any better?
  ans:
  - A little bit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your grandfather's here.

- que:
  - Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
  ans:
  - You are sick, that's why he's here.

- que:
  - Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
  ans:
  - Please, please, that's what we're here for. Be careful, that hurt.

- que:
  - Ooooooops.
  ans:
  - What are you saying?

- que:
  - Who are you? What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don't you speak?
  ans:
  - Scared. Can't talk.

- que:
  - Then account for yourself! Do you believe in God? Do you believe in gold? Why are you looking up old lady's dresses? Bit of a pervert, eh?
  ans:
  - But sir, I'm not condem ...

- que:
  - I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention. Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
  ans:
  - I have hurt your feelings.

- que:
  - Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
  ans:
  - Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.

- que:
  - What is that? A handkerchief?
  ans:
  - It's nothing ... nothing.

- que:
  - They come here. They all come here. How do they find me?
  ans:
  - Mr. Bialystock ...

- que:
  - Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
  ans:
  - This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.

- que:
  - I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop. What difference does it make?
  ans:
  - It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.

- que:
  - Oh, it's all right ... wha?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.

- que:
  - Yes, what?
  ans:
  - What you were saying. Keep talking.

- que:
  - What was I saying?
  ans:
  - You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.

- que:
  - Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
  ans:
  - You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.

- que:
  - What did I do?
  ans:
  - You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.

- que:
  - Exactly. And how long did it run?
  ans:
  - One night.

- que:
  - But what if the play was a hit?
  ans:
  - Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. I'm hysterical. I can't stop. When I get like this, I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

- que:
  - Okay. I'm way over here. Is that better?
  ans:
  - It's a little better, but you still look angry.

- que:
  - Well, you know what they say, \"Smile and the world smiles with you.\" Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight jacket. Feeling better?
  ans:
  - They certainly do. They certainly do. Come, let me take you to lunch.

- que:
  - Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What do you think, Max?
  ans:
  - Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day. Why waste it indoors. I've got it! Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.

- que:
  - Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Let's see. We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.

- que:
  - Everybody's a big shot. Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I think so. I feel very strange.

- que:
  - Max, what is it? What are you doing? What's happening?
  ans:
  - You found a flop!

- que:
  - Who wrote it?
  ans:
  - Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.

- que:
  - There it is... in red and white! \"Springtime For Hitler,\" signed, sealed and delivered. What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band. I don't care how big the deal is.

- que:
  - Leo, what if this play is a hit?
  ans:
  - Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm going to buy a toy. I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.

- que:
  - What is she gonna do here?
  ans:
  - I'll show you. Ulla, go to work.

- que:
  - Roger De Bris. Roger De Bris. Oh yes, the director. Is he good... I mean bad?
  ans:
  - Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.

- que:
  - Do you think he'll take the job?
  ans:
  - Only if we ask him.

- que:
  - Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
  ans:
  - So much for Nutsy Fagin.

- que:
  - No way out. No way out. What? Who?
  ans:
  - The majority. The majority. Yes. Let's hear from the majority.

- que:
  - What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Max, I...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.

- que:
  - I vas never a member of the Nazi party. I am not responsible. I only followed orders. Who are you?
  ans:
  - Mr. Liebkind, wait. You don't understand.

- que:
  - My play? You mean, \"Springtime For ... \" you know who?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Vat about it?
  ans:
  - We loved it. We thought it was a masterpiece. That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.

- que:
  - You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
  ans:
  - I vas vit him a great deal, you know.

- que:
  - No kidding?
  ans:
  - Really, I never dreamed ...

- que:
  - It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
  ans:
  - Wait. No. How do I know I can trust you? How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

- que:
  - Vaaaat?
  ans:
  - Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time. This is a man of his time.

- que:
  - Never mind. Listen. Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why?
  ans:
  - It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...

- que:
  - I can't. I can't do it. It's a demon. It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
  ans:
  - You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?

- que:
  - Do you need us?
  ans:
  - Of course I need you. It's dark in there.

- que:
  - We make love?
  ans:
  - No! No! We don't make love. Go to work.

- que:
  - LADY Feeling better?
  ans:
  - Wait. Wait. We can't play today. I have too many appointments.

- que:
  - LADY We can't play today?
  ans:
  - Thursday. Thursday. We'll play Thursday. We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.

- que:
  - Vat?
  ans:
  - People can hear you.

- que:
  - I need it. How'm I gonna find the fuse?
  ans:
  - Oh, ve come vit you. All for one and all in the light.

- que:
  - What have you done, LSD?
  ans:
  - Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.

- que:
  - What do you do best?
  ans:
  - Send for Goebbels.

- que:
  - What did you tell the people?
  ans:
  - I told them we invaded England.

- que:
  - Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we come out?
  ans:
  - We won.

- que:
  - I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use. This used to be the main highway. Want to register, please?
  ans:
  - Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...

- que:
  - You out to buy a motel?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days... What was it you wanted to ask?
  ans:
  - I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.

- que:
  - We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area... Did she stop here?
  ans:
  - No. No one has stopped here in weeks...

- que:
  - Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
  ans:
  - Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...

- que:
  - How early?
  ans:
  - Very early. Dawn.

- que:
  - Of which morning?
  ans:
  - The following morning. Sunday.

- que:
  - No one met her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
  ans:
  - No! Of all...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You said she was sitting \"back there,\" or standing rather...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Cash or check? For the cabin...

- que:
  - Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
  ans:
  - Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like. Come on.

- que:
  - Anyone at home?
  ans:
  - I live there. Alone.

- que:
  - If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me. But... She didn't fool my mother.
  ans:
  - If she paid you well?

- que:
  - Your mother met her? Can I talk to your mother?
  ans:
  - No. I told you, she's confined...

- que:
  - All right! Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother. But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
  ans:
  - Let's all talk about Mary.

- que:
  - What's your interest?
  ans:
  - Money.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Must've needed it.

- que:
  - What are you talking about? What is this?
  ans:
  - Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...

- que:
  - I don't believe it. Do you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars. She is your girl friend, isn't she?
  ans:
  - Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...

- que:
  - You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over? You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
  ans:
  - Of course not. Please.

- que:
  - Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - But what? Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
  ans:
  - No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.

- que:
  - Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
  ans:
  - Aren't you going to take the pills? They'll knock that headache out.

- que:
  - Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
  ans:
  - She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...

- que:
  - How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - A lot?
  ans:
  - Forty thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Did he say anything about my sister?
  ans:
  - Just what he told your detective.

- que:
  - May I talk to you?
  ans:
  - Sure...

- que:
  - Is something wrong?
  ans:
  - I want to know if my sister is here.

- que:
  - Here?
  ans:
  - With you.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.

- que:
  - No. I take it you don't either? How long?
  ans:
  - Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.

- que:
  - And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
  ans:
  - Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.

- que:
  - What thing could we be in together?
  ans:
  - I hate tears.

- que:
  - Is Mary... in trouble?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
  ans:
  - Not that kind... You men and your egos.

- que:
  - It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
  ans:
  - No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.

- que:
  - I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
  ans:
  - She haven't even called you?

- que:
  - You want me to stay here?
  ans:
  - She'll need both of us.

- que:
  - Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
  ans:
  - Sam. He said an hour. Or less.

- que:
  - He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
  ans:
  - You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

- que:
  - Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
  ans:
  - I feel better when you feel better.

- que:
  - Where's the old highway?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Sam! Why call when we can go?
  ans:
  - And maybe pass Arbogast on the road? Thanks.

- que:
  - Why can't I go out there with you?
  ans:
  - I don't know... One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.

- que:
  - Just wait here?
  ans:
  - Contemplate your... panic button.

- que:
  - He didn't come back here?
  ans:
  - Sam.

- que:
  - Where could he have gone?
  ans:
  - Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...

- que:
  - Without calling me?
  ans:
  - In a hurry.

- que:
  - Who's he?
  ans:
  - He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.

- que:
  - Where'd you go to college?
  ans:
  - She was willing to lick the stamps.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - She always tries to be proper.

- que:
  - You going to wait here for me?
  ans:
  - I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...

- que:
  - I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
  ans:
  - Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.

- que:
  - I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
  ans:
  - How could we prove... Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - That's proof Mary was here! It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...

- que:
  - You can't go up there.
  ans:
  - Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Bates.

- que:
  - It's regular. Okay?
  ans:
  - I could stand something regular.

- que:
  - What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
  ans:
  - We could laze around here a while longer.

- que:
  - Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
  ans:
  - I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.

- que:
  - Can you?
  ans:
  - Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...

- que:
  - Don't miss your plane.
  ans:
  - Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?

- que:
  - Hey, we can leave together can't we?
  ans:
  - I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.

- que:
  - You have a vacancy?
  ans:
  - We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. They moved away the highway.

- que:
  - Am I that close to Fairvale?
  ans:
  - Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

- que:
  - I have?
  ans:
  - There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.

- que:
  - You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Don't worry about it. But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
  ans:
  - You're very... kind.

- que:
  - Is your time so empty?
  ans:
  - Oh, no! I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.

- que:
  - Friends? Who needs friends. A boy's best friend is his mother. You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
  ans:
  - Only my share.

- que:
  - Why do you ask that?
  ans:
  - Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.

- que:
  - To a private island, like you?
  ans:
  - No, not like me.

- que:
  - You're not going to... to your room already?
  ans:
  - I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.

- que:
  - Phoenix?
  ans:
  - I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out. Before it's too late for me, too.

- que:
  - You slept here all night?
  ans:
  - Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...

- que:
  - I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
  ans:
  - No, m'am.

- que:
  - Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
  ans:
  - Frankly, yes.

- que:
  - Is there?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...

- que:
  - Mary is Lila's sister?
  ans:
  - Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...

- que:
  - He's already been.
  ans:
  - You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?

- que:
  - At this hour?
  ans:
  - Recluse. Kinder word.

- que:
  - He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
  ans:
  - I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

- que:
  - Have you two had breakfast?
  ans:
  - Just coming up to ring for you.

- que:
  - Better sign in first, hasn't we?
  ans:
  - It isn't necessary.

- que:
  - Looking for me?
  ans:
  - Yes, matter of fact. The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.

- que:
  - Satisfied with your cabin?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I didn't think so.
  ans:
  - And now that your mother's dead?

- que:
  - You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you've been saying.

- que:
  - Mother, please...
  ans:
  - I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?

- que:
  - And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
  ans:
  - Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...

- que:
  - They thought she'd be coming to me.
  ans:
  - Shut up! Shut up!

- que:
  - Left Phoenix under her own steam?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - From what?
  ans:
  - Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.

- que:
  - Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place. What'd he exactly say when he called you?
  ans:
  - He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.

- que:
  - Was that all?
  ans:
  - This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.

- que:
  - Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
  ans:
  - Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.

- que:
  - Did I?
  ans:
  - That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.

- que:
  - What--special autopsy?
  ans:
  - Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.

- que:
  - You mean he doesn't work for you?
  ans:
  - No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.

- que:
  - So--friendly or otherwise--?
  ans:
  -  At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.

- que:
  - Then you knew of the inheritance?
  ans:
  - Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.

- que:
  - Who are you? What is your name?
  ans:
  - I don't know, .

- que:
  - What made you steal? Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.

- que:
  - Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
  ans:
  - You--a friend to me?

- que:
  - I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
  ans:
  - Dr. Meirschultz, too?

- que:
  - Why didn't you notify the police?
  ans:
  - I understand from your neighbors that all  cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.

- que:
  -  How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
  ans:
  - Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.

- que:
  - Thousands?
  ans:
  - Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.

- que:
  - What' s the idea ?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.

- que:
  - By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
  ans:
  - I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.

- que:
  - By the way, where is your assistant?
  ans:
  - Oh, Maxwell? He's left.

- que:
  - Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
  ans:
  - So--that's it. Buckley took the body.

- que:
  - Yes indeed. He has been a difficult have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.

- que:
  - Do you have many patients, doctor?
  ans:
  - Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.

- que:
  - What's down there?
  ans:
  - Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.

- que:
  - Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
  ans:
  - Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.

- que:
  - He isn't here.
  ans:
  - Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to call the police.

- que:
  - Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
  ans:
  - How? What can I do?

- que:
  - Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - What were you dreaming about?
  ans:
  - A voice ...

- que:
  - That spoke to you?
  ans:
  - That called ... commanded ...

- que:
  - Did you hear?
  ans:
  - Yes, the child ...

- que:
  - I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
  ans:
  - I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.

- que:
  - What are you laughing at?
  ans:
  - I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.

- que:
  - I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.

- que:
  - But what about lunch?
  ans:
  - I'll have it for supper. So long.

- que:
  - Why didn't you eat last night?
  ans:
  - Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.

- que:
  - You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
  ans:
  - No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.

- que:
  - Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
  ans:
  - Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.

- que:
  - Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
  ans:
  - I'm not quarreling, only ...

- que:
  - So that's the way it is?
  ans:
  - That's the way I feel about it.

- que:
  - Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
  ans:
  - I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.

- que:
  - Are you giving me this straight?
  ans:
  - Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.

- que:
  - What do you think I am?
  ans:
  - Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.

- que:
  - As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
  ans:
  - You mean he was colored?

- que:
  - Yeah. Have a pleasant vacation?
  ans:
  - Charming. More delightful people crippled.

- que:
  - Meaning what?
  ans:
  - I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!

- que:
  - Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
  ans:
  - You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.

- que:
  - Which one is me? The horse?
  ans:
  - Get out of here.

- que:
  - Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - I used to be married to one.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.

- que:
  - No kiddin'?
  ans:
  - Almost certain.

- que:
  - You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
  ans:
  - This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.

- que:
  - Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
  ans:
  - Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.

- que:
  - Don't remember what day that was, do you?
  ans:
  - No, sir. About three months ago.

- que:
  - You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
  ans:
  - No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.

- que:
  - I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog. Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
  ans:
  - You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?

- que:
  - I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
  ans:
  - That's the one.

- que:
  - They don't suspect him?
  ans:
  - Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.

- que:
  - What does that prove?
  ans:
  - Hotcha! Saved, one job!

- que:
  - Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
  ans:
  - It's all yours.

- que:
  - Where'd you get the stag hound?
  ans:
  - He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.

- que:
  - Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
  ans:
  - No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.

- que:
  - Cry-baby?
  ans:
  - They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.

- que:
  - I see. Was that all she said?
  ans:
  - We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.

- que:
  - You weren't going with her?
  ans:
  - No. Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.

- que:
  - Who'd steal her body?
  ans:
  - That's what they're going to ask you.

- que:
  - Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
  ans:
  - I told you I didn't want to mix in it.

- que:
  - Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You go in for dangerous things.

- que:
  - How much money have you got?
  ans:
  - Heaven knows. A lot.

- que:
  - You will have won the undying gratitude of us all. Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
  ans:
  - I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back.

- que:
  - Is that a fact?
  ans:
  - Fire insurance!

- que:
  - A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
  ans:
  - And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.

- que:
  - If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
  ans:
  - One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.

- que:
  - That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
  ans:
  - Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor -- A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.

- que:
  - Have you got it? Is it completed?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.

- que:
  - Shall we unpack it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What are you laughing at?
  ans:
  - He can't hear you.

- que:
  - You taking any medication?
  ans:
  - Dad...

- que:
  - Two, what if I didn't miss?
  ans:
  - You did.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - What was her name? The one I met.

- que:
  - Mia...?
  ans:
  - Yes....

- que:
  - Could we go somewhere?
  ans:
  - I'm heading out of town.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I could go out of town.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - A place you've never been.

- que:
  - Why am I doing this?
  ans:
  - It's an experiment.

- que:
  - What universe are you in, Paul?
  ans:
  - A quantum one.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness. Mia.

- que:
  - What did it want?
  ans:
  - That's what it asked me. \"What do you want?\" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment.

- que:
  - Like now?
  ans:
  - No. I didn't. I'm listening.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - So I can move on. You too.

- que:
  - Is Rose here?
  ans:
  - She must have gone out for a walk with the children.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.

- que:
  - Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
  ans:
  - Nobody.

- que:
  - But who were they?
  ans:
  - They were just bad men, that's all.

- que:
  - In what sense were they bad?
  ans:
  - Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.

- que:
  - Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
  ans:
  - Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.

- que:
  - What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
  ans:
  - There was this old man that ate his niece.

- que:
  - Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost. I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
  ans:
  - Well, all right.

- que:
  - But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
  ans:
  - Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

- que:
  - What did you expect?
  ans:
  - Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.

- que:
  - Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
  ans:
  - Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.

- que:
  - Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
  ans:
  - Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.

- que:
  - Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
  ans:
  - Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.

- que:
  - Who would want to do such a thing as that?
  ans:
  - Well, some fiend might.

- que:
  - Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
  ans:
  - I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.

- que:
  - Buddy, you're just a child.
  ans:
  - Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?

- que:
  - I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
  ans:
  - Well, nothin'.

- que:
  - Am I hurting you?
  ans:
  - No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.

- que:
  - Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.

- que:
  - I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
  ans:
  - You're going to get yourself up and go out?

- que:
  - Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - He did?
  ans:
  - Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.

- que:
  - He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'd believe it.

- que:
  - Hi, Buddy. How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Take a little walk with me, huh?
  ans:
  - They're dumb things. I got tired of them.

- que:
  - How did the rabbits kill him?
  ans:
  - Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.

- que:
  - What was your mother like?
  ans:
  - Rose is madly in love with Daddy...

- que:
  - Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
  ans:
  - Well, yeah.

- que:
  - I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What do you think, Brother?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.

- que:
  - But how would you find him?
  ans:
  - No, she hasn't. I think I hear a car.

- que:
  - Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
  ans:
  - You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.

- que:
  - Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
  ans:
  - I said ahhh-dam stuff.

- que:
  - Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
  ans:
  - She's getting herself up to go out.

- que:
  - What'd you say, Brother?
  ans:
  - She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.

- que:
  - Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - She's watching the car again?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
  ans:
  - They're discussing it.

- que:
  - What are they doing?
  ans:
  - Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.

- que:
  - What are they doing, Doll?
  ans:
  - He kissed her.

- que:
  - Is that all?
  ans:
  - He had his hand on her titty.

- que:
  - What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
  ans:
  - Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.

- que:
  - Buddy... does Rose really... \"do it\" with all those boys and men?
  ans:
  - Doll, don't ask childish questions.

- que:
  - What's goin' on?
  ans:
  - Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.

- que:
  - Why is it taking so long?
  ans:
  - Here comes Daddy.

- que:
  - About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son. Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
  ans:
  - It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.

- que:
  - Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they're in the snow.

- que:
  - Are they polar bears, too?
  ans:
  - Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.

- que:
  - What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
  ans:
  - Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.

- que:
  - What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

- que:
  - Is her husband sick or something?
  ans:
  - The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.

- que:
  - Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
  ans:
  - You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.

- que:
  - All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - No, son, she is dead.

- que:
  - Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
  ans:
  - I'm not blubbering.

- que:
  - Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
  ans:
  - Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.

- que:
  - Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
  ans:
  - Please do.

- que:
  - How goes it, darlin'?
  ans:
  - Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.

- que:
  - What do you think of her, honey?
  ans:
  - Turn up your hearing aid.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.

- que:
  - Oh. Did you say something?
  ans:
  - I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.

- que:
  - What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
  ans:
  - No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.

- que:
  - You're not having lunch?
  ans:
  - Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Quarter of twelve.

- que:
  - Is she all right?
  ans:
  - I don't see any bruises or broken bones.

- que:
  - Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
  ans:
  - No reason at all, darlin'.

- que:
  - Well, time will tell, won't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, darlin', time will tell.

- que:
  - I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
  ans:
  - Boys? You say to me boys?

- que:
  - It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
  ans:
  - I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.

- que:
  - Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
  ans:
  - Honey, please...

- que:
  - It has been three weeks since I \"fired\" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
  ans:
  - She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.

- que:
  - Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
  ans:
  - She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.

- que:
  - That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
  ans:
  - She already told you, she doesn't know.

- que:
  - But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
  ans:
  - Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh? In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.

- que:
  - Honey!
  ans:
  - What did you forget?

- que:
  - I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
  ans:
  - Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.

- que:
  - Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
  ans:
  - I... I'll get the grits.

- que:
  - Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
  ans:
  - Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?

- que:
  - Is anything wrong?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Got yourself up?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm goin' out.

- que:
  - How can the buttons stand the pressure?
  ans:
  - There are more on the other side.

- que:
  - What have you got in your hair, girl?
  ans:
  - My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.

- que:
  - Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
  ans:
  - Oh, anywhere downtown.

- que:
  - You don't know where you're going?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.

- que:
  - Is this ill right?
  ans:
  - It'll do just fine. Bye-bye, see you later.

- que:
  - Strange voices, Rose?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
  ans:
  - Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.

- que:
  - That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.

- que:
  - And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
  ans:
  - Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.

- que:
  - Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
  ans:
  - What's the use, there ain't none.

- que:
  - Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
  ans:
  - Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.

- que:
  - I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
  ans:
  - You mean a farm?

- que:
  - What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
  ans:
  - Mine.

- que:
  - Your baby?
  ans:
  - Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.

- que:
  - All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
  ans:
  - Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.

- que:
  - What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
  ans:
  - Nothing, Rose.

- que:
  - Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
  ans:
  - Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.

- que:
  - Ha ha, course you make a lot more. What's that you got there, Buddy?
  ans:
  - Galley proof.

- que:
  - Galley what?
  ans:
  - Page proof of a book I'm working on.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.

- que:
  - Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - Well, no, I didn't actually.

- que:
  - I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
  ans:
  - You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I. You'll have to admit she had four husbands.

- que:
  - She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I remember it.

- que:
  - Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
  ans:
  - Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.

- que:
  - What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
  ans:
  - Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me. Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.

- que:
  - Yes, dear, what is it?
  ans:
  - You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.

- que:
  - She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
  ans:
  - What's the matter with him?

- que:
  - Afraid of the hospital?
  ans:
  - Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.

- que:
  - A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
  ans:
  - Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean \"epi-zoo-ot-tics,\" an animal epidemic?
  ans:
  - Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.

- que:
  - Gonorrhea?
  ans:
  - Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.

- que:
  - What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
  ans:
  - Yes, go on.

- que:
  - Illusions, Madam?
  ans:
  - Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.

- que:
  - Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
  ans:
  - She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.

- que:
  - But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
  ans:
  - Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.

- que:
  - Mother... is Rose going to die?
  ans:
  - No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.

- que:
  - What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
  ans:
  - More history, Rose.

- que:
  - Are you going to get your degree soon?
  ans:
  - Well, I am working on my thesis.

- que:
  - Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
  ans:
  - You're so sweet.

- que:
  - Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
  ans:
  - Well, you run on now.

- que:
  - Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
  ans:
  - No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

- que:
  - Well, I think it's charming, Rose. But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.

- que:
  - Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
  ans:
  - Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.

- que:
  - Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
  ans:
  - You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.

- que:
  - Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake. What's wrong, Kittle? You don't swing?
  ans:
  - What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.

- que:
  - You think it's that good?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.

- que:
  - And... ?
  ans:
  - What and? That's what I got.

- que:
  - A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
  ans:
  - Now you know what to watch for...

- que:
  - Have I ever steered you wrong?
  ans:
  - Cuff'em. Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.

- que:
  - Who cares?
  ans:
  - Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...

- que:
  - If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
  ans:
  - Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln. A parade float.

- que:
  - What... ?
  ans:
  - Abe Lincoln...

- que:
  - Hey now... what the fuck... ?
  ans:
  - Again.

- que:
  - How's your precious little school-marm today?
  ans:
  - She's fine, as if you cared.

- que:
  - Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
  ans:
  - Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.

- que:
  - What'd I say?
  ans:
  - It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.

- que:
  - What, am I supposed to read it while I drive? Keep a grip on it, alright?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't litter.

- que:
  - Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
  ans:
  - What do you want me to do about it?

- que:
  - What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
  ans:
  - I'm just saying...

- que:
  - All I got is being a cop. What do I do if I'm not that?
  ans:
  - It's personal. We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour. See ya then.

- que:
  - Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's the plan?
  ans:
  - Beats me. You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The booze.

- que:
  - You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants? How do you think it got its name?
  ans:
  - They... they shot me.

- que:
  - What day is it?
  ans:
  - Same day as before. I think.

- que:
  - Where we going?
  ans:
  - We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.

- que:
  - How you doing back there?
  ans:
  - Feeling great.

- que:
  - Why do I always have to sit in back?
  ans:
  - It's just the way things are, kiddo.

- que:
  - Wha... ?
  ans:
  - Birth control's important.

- que:
  - What... what kinda thing is that to say?
  ans:
  - You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.

- que:
  - Smooth move, hot-shot.
  ans:
  - What's mine say?

- que:
  - What was I supposed to do?
  ans:
  - Laugh it up. You'll cry later.

- que:
  - What the... ?! What was that for?
  ans:
  - Follow me.

- que:
  - Where we going?
  ans:
  - We have to find Kittle.

- que:
  - Okay. But, what changed our mind?
  ans:
  - Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.

- que:
  - Then, why'd we tie him up?
  ans:
  - Who said it wa's me, hub? Anyway... he fell off a ladder. It wasn't really my fault.

- que:
  - Can't you say something nice once?
  ans:
  - Okay. It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.

- que:
  - You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
  ans:
  - I'm waiting till the time's right.

- que:
  - What about Jack Daniels? Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where have you been?
  ans:
  - I'm here. That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...

- que:
  - You going rogue on me?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
  ans:
  - He went to pick up lunch.

- que:
  - No. Don't open your mouth! You honestly think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
  ans:
  - I... I think I can... clarify...

- que:
  - Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
  ans:
  - Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.

- que:
  - What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
  ans:
  - Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.

- que:
  - Murderer? Really?
  ans:
  - Thanks, but we don't recognize \"brunch\" as an actual meal.

- que:
  - You fuckers... damn you! Why?! Why me!? Why the obsession with me?
  ans:
  - It's our job.

- que:
  - Pardon me... my mistake. Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
  ans:
  - Whoops... don't mind me. Go ahead and finish up.

- que:
  - Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well... nobody's perfect. They couldn't go doing everything at once.

- que:
  - Alright?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Hold your horses, sweetpea. We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
  ans:
  - Can't be worse than you.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.

- que:
  - What... ? Not you too?
  ans:
  - He's right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.

- que:
  - Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
  ans:
  - You need a doctor.

- que:
  - Any preferences?
  ans:
  - Whatever goes bang.

- que:
  - You get him?
  ans:
  - Dead.

- que:
  - If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Gimmie a minute.

- que:
  - Been waiting long?
  ans:
  - Just got here.

- que:
  - How'd we do?
  ans:
  - A.D. is a C.P.A.

- que:
  - Come again... ?
  ans:
  - Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that's all we got.

- que:
  - You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
  ans:
  - Seatbelts fastened, please.

- que:
  - Think Zimmermann's watching?
  ans:
  - So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.

- que:
  - Know what I love about dynamite?
  ans:
  - Do tell.

- que:
  - You see that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
  ans:
  - They're... around.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - Jabba's palace.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

- que:
  - What is thy bidding, my Master?
  ans:
  - Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.

- que:
  - What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
  ans:
  - Wouldn't miss it.

- que:
  - How are we doing?
  ans:
  - The same as always.

- que:
  - That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
  ans:
  - I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

- que:
  - You got her warmed?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she's comin' up.

- que:
  - Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
  ans:
  - All set.

- que:
  - Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - Hey, are you awake?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

- que:
  - Shall we try and go around?
  ans:
  - It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You love him, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
  ans:
  - Han! Chewie?

- que:
  - Well, look at you, a general, huh?
  ans:
  - Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

- que:
  - All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
  ans:
  - Good luck.

- que:
  - On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
  ans:
  - Here we go again.

- que:
  - What are you telling them?
  ans:
  - Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

- que:
  - Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
  ans:
  - I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

- que:
  - Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
  ans:
  - Let's see.

- que:
  - What's he saying?
  ans:
  - Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

- que:
  - What do you remember?
  ans:
  - Just...images, really. Feelings.

- que:
  - She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this?
  ans:
  - I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

- que:
  - Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
  ans:
  - Vader is here...now, on this moon.

- que:
  - Your father?
  ans:
  - There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

- que:
  - But, why must you confront him?
  ans:
  - The Emperor has been expecting you.

- que:
  - Told you, did he?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Unfortunate that I know the truth?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
  ans:
  - I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

- que:
  - How many languages do you speak?
  ans:
  - I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...

- que:
  - Disintegrated?
  ans:
  - You tricked me. I wouldn't have - I've never - never.

- que:
  - Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
  ans:
  - Like this. Like how? It's your fault - you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.

- que:
  - You promise you won't tell?
  ans:
  - On my mother's grave.

- que:
  - Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
  ans:
  - Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.

- que:
  - What was that bang?
  ans:
  - We must have a blow-out.

- que:
  - Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of place is this?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

- que:
  - Say! Do any of you guys know the Madison?
  ans:
  - Brad, please lets get out of here.

- que:
  - I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
  ans:
  - If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.

- que:
  - Ssssh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
  ans:
  - Like this - like how? It's your fault. You're to blame. I was saving myself.

- que:
  - Are you - giving a party?
  ans:
  - No. You've arrived on a rather special night. It's one of the master's affairs.

- que:
  - Who's Eddie?
  ans:
  - The delivery boy.

- que:
  - ...How's the turtle food this week?
  ans:
  - ...Fine.

- que:
  - And you never got the chance?
  ans:
  - But you never had a chance to prove yourself.

- que:
  - Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
  ans:
  - ...Guess.

- que:
  - Would ya like a glass of water?
  ans:
  - ...No thanks.

- que:
  - I had it pulled. People callin' all the time. Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
  ans:
  - I wanna let my brother know where I am.

- que:
  - D'you really wanna call?
  ans:
  - Yes, I do.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I think he might be worried.

- que:
  - What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
  ans:
  - I don't think I belong here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The glasses... Please.

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - Could ya take off that hat.

- que:
  - Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
  ans:
  - Bout seven.

- que:
  - Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Like?
  ans:
  - Sharp -- Real nice.

- que:
  - Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
  ans:
  - No... Sharp -- You look great.

- que:
  - Yeah...
  ans:
  - ...Are you going to say anything to him?

- que:
  - What did you say about a pet shop?
  ans:
  - I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.

- que:
  - Is everything all right?
  ans:
  - I gotta go out for a while.

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - ...I can't beat him.

- que:
  - Apollo?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I can't beat him.

- que:
  - What're we going to do?
  ans:
  - ...I dunno.

- que:
  - ...Like you?
  ans:
  - Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.

- que:
  - Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
  ans:
  - I'll carry him 'till the third.

- que:
  - No, man, it's very smart.
  ans:
  - Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?

- que:
  - How 'bout this Billy Snow?
  ans:
  - Fouls.

- que:
  - How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
  ans:
  - Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.

- que:
  - Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
  ans:
  - Very high an' very fast.

- que:
  - Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
  ans:
  - He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.

- que:
  - Where're you off to now?
  ans:
  - Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.

- que:
  - Of wa?
  ans:
  - ...Of the truck that run over your face.

- que:
  - Does that bum have to say that?
  ans:
  - I don't like ya face.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.

- que:
  - What's ya name again?
  ans:
  - Bob.

- que:
  - That's it? -- Completely?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - What about for food an' stuff?
  ans:
  - You have my food in ya hand.

- que:
  - Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
  ans:
  - ...Fine.

- que:
  - Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
  ans:
  - No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.

- que:
  - You think I don't hear things?
  ans:
  - Paulie's sister.

- que:
  - Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
  ans:
  - A few bucks.

- que:
  - Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
  ans:
  - Gonna try.

- que:
  - Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna do somethin with it.

- que:
  - Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
  ans:
  - Where else am I gonna go. Bet three grand on Rocky.

- que:
  - Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
  ans:
  - Excuse me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.

- que:
  - Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
  ans:
  - ...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.

- que:
  - Did you hear what I said?
  ans:
  - Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - ...Screw you, yoyo.

- que:
  - Maybe I like garbage.
  ans:
  - Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Listen, I hope ya don't --

- que:
  - Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
  ans:
  - Dipper needed it.

- que:
  - How old?
  ans:
  - Come July, twenty-five.

- que:
  - Did ya win?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Kayo.

- que:
  - ...Who'd ya fight?
  ans:
  - Spider Rice.

- que:
  - Ain't they?
  ans:
  - Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.

- que:
  - Hey, ever think about retirin'?
  ans:
  - ...No.

- que:
  - Message -- What message?
  ans:
  - A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.

- que:
  - When was they here?
  ans:
  - Bout an hour ago.

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.

- que:
  - Whatta' those?
  ans:
  - Turtles -- domestic turtles.

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - Ya got a good mind for dates.

- que:
  - Really think so?
  ans:
  - Ya got heart.

- que:
  - Don't you care what the people will say?
  ans:
  - ...I'm doin' it for a friend.

- que:
  - Whatta you get outta this?
  ans:
  - I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.

- que:
  - Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
  ans:
  - God bless ya, Rock.

- que:
  - How am I doin'?
  ans:
  - Real good.

- que:
  - Damn! How's it look?
  ans:
  - Fine... That guy's great.

- que:
  - Would you keep goin'?
  ans:
  - ...Yeah.

- que:
  - How I look out there, Mick?
  ans:
  - Great, kid, great.

- que:
  - Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
  ans:
  - It ain't your locker no more.

- que:
  - Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
  ans:
  - Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.

- que:
  - Bout what?
  ans:
  - Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.

- que:
  - How's Butkus this mornin'?
  ans:
  - Ain't had time to check 'em.

- que:
  - ...What kinda dog is this again?
  ans:
  - Bullmastiff.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.

- que:
  - Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
  ans:
  - My sister's a friggin' loser.

- que:
  - Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
  ans:
  - Absolutely...

- que:
  - What kinda business?
  ans:
  - Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.

- que:
  - Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.

- que:
  - Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
  ans:
  - Maybe ya better forget it.

- que:
  - What's ya sister like to do?
  ans:
  - Ice skate.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.

- que:
  - Help what?
  ans:
  - Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.

- que:
  - How ya feelin'?
  ans:
  - ...Tight.

- que:
  - If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
  ans:
  - Gazzo's a good man.

- que:
  - Ya really like her?
  ans:
  - Sure I like her.

- que:
  - What's the attraction? I don't see it?
  ans:
  - I dunno -- she fills gaps.

- que:
  - What gaps?
  ans:
  - She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.

- que:
  - You ballin' her?
  ans:
  - Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.

- que:
  - Whatta these guys want?
  ans:
  - To see ya train.

- que:
  - What can I do about it?
  ans:
  - ...People talk to me more.

- que:
  - How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
  ans:
  - We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.

- que:
  - I'll tear his head off.
  ans:
  - Do you feel you have a chance?

- que:
  - Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
  ans:
  - Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.

- que:
  - This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
  ans:
  - Feel? I dunno... Happy.

- que:
  - How will you fight Apollo Creed?
  ans:
  - Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.

- que:
  - Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
  ans:
  - Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.

- que:
  - We don't serve formula. Snookums.
  ans:
  - And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?

- que:
  - You serve martinis, doncha?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Oh, a ladies man, huh?
  ans:
  - My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

- que:
  - So what's your next move, Valiant?
  ans:
  - Make it dry. Baby doesn't like to be wet. You're Valiant, right? The name's Baby Herman.

- que:
  - I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.

- que:
  - So where is it then?
  ans:
  - Somebody took it from him. That's what this whole thing's about.

- que:
  - Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?
  ans:
  - Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown.

- que:
  - Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
  ans:
  - Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie... 'Boop boop be-doop'.

- que:
  - Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
  ans:
  - That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

- que:
  - Big on the musical comedy, huh?
  ans:
  - Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.

- que:
  - You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
  ans:
  - What's this, Roger?

- que:
  - Is this paper even good?
  ans:
  - Check the scrawl.

- que:
  - No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
  ans:
  - Bastards put him on notice.

- que:
  - Do you think the rabbit did it?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna think. I wanna drink.

- que:
  - Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
  ans:
  - Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
  ans:
  - It's all yours.

- que:
  - Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
  ans:
  - If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.

- que:
  - So what's the scam, Eddie?
  ans:
  - Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants Acme's property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.

- que:
  - Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
  ans:
  - Yeah, do that. I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - That was the rabbit's wife.

- que:
  - The rabbit's wife? Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
  ans:
  - Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.

- que:
  - Maroon, right?
  ans:
  - Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.

- que:
  - What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
  ans:
  - Got me. But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

- que:
  - What's that comin' from the bar?
  ans:
  - Sounds like singin'.

- que:
  - What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
  ans:
  - Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.

- que:
  - That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?
  ans:
  - Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.

- que:
  - Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
  ans:
  - Men? They look more like weasles to me.

- que:
  - Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
  ans:
  - Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.

- que:
  - So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
  ans:
  - Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year.

- que:
  - Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
  ans:
  - Ask her...

- que:
  - They?
  ans:
  - The other people who were in here lookin' for the will. I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.

- que:
  - You're not takin' me to downtown Toontown?
  ans:
  - Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.

- que:
  - So you're Cloverleaf?
  ans:
  - No one person is Cloverleaf. We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.

- que:
  - Come on, Doom. What would a company like that want with Toontown?
  ans:
  - It wasn't Toontown they wanted. It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.

- que:
  - What the hell's a freeway?
  ans:
  - Not really. Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - That's right, me.

- que:
  - Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
  ans:
  - Toon cops worked me over.

- que:
  - What am I, Earl?
  ans:
  - You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

- que:
  - Does it hurt?
  ans:
  - Not much. It's hard to talk.

- que:
  - Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that's what he was after?
  ans:
  - Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.

- que:
  - Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
  ans:
  - Toons aren't given imperfections.

- que:
  - I'm not complainin'. But give me credit. I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
  ans:
  - So altruistic.

- que:
  - It's the truth. Why won't you believe it?
  ans:
  - Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills. I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

- que:
  - If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
  ans:
  - You shot Roger.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - I didn't know who I could trust.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - He's right here in the...

- que:
  - How did you get onto Doom?
  ans:
  - Marvin told me. Doom was after his land. Ne was afraid. That's why he brought me his will.

- que:
  - So where is it?
  ans:
  - When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.

- que:
  - Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
  ans:
  - He made me laugh.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.

- que:
  - Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
  ans:
  - No one knows. He bought the election a few years back. He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - Doom.

- que:
  - How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
  ans:
  - Only there's no business like it, no business I know.

- que:
  - One too many safes dropped on his head?
  ans:
  - Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.

- que:
  - So what do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.

- que:
  - When will I hear from you?
  ans:
  - As soon as is humanly possible.

- que:
  - Valiant? What're you doin' here?
  ans:
  - I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.

- que:
  - Maybe. Why?
  ans:
  - Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.

- que:
  - Stop what?
  ans:
  - Valiant! You surprised me.

- que:
  - You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
  ans:
  - No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.

- que:
  - You got the will in there, don't ya?
  ans:
  - I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
  ans:
  - In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out!

- que:
  - If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
  ans:
  - Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run.

- que:
  - Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.

- que:
  - Does this help?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's better.

- que:
  - You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
  ans:
  - Well, no, not any time. Only when it was funny.

- que:
  - Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
  ans:
  - My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

- que:
  - Hey, don't I get an encore?
  ans:
  - Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you. I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.

- que:
  - Just because you got 'em to laugh?
  ans:
  - A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.

- que:
  - Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
  ans:
  - A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.

- que:
  - I think you want a drink. How about it, Judge?
  ans:
  - Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.

- que:
  - Valiant and Valiant? Who's the other Valiant?
  ans:
  - My brother. Get inside.

- que:
  - So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
  ans:
  - We can't do anything till it's dark.

- que:
  - Say, who's this guy laughin'?
  ans:
  - Me.

- que:
  - Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
  ans:
  - You wanna know? Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.

- que:
  - Safe?
  ans:
  - Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again.

- que:
  - Wrong number?
  ans:
  - No, it's not.

- que:
  - How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
  ans:
  - Two bits.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doin' in there?
  ans:
  - I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I think you oughta read it to her.

- que:
  - I guess I am at that. Cigar?
  ans:
  - By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife. She's a good lady. I'm glad you got her back.

- que:
  - And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it?
  ans:
  - Only time will tell.

- que:
  - Pretty good cigar. Where'd you get it?
  ans:
  - From this box here...

- que:
  - Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
  ans:
  - Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

- que:
  -  Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
  ans:
  - Quarrel sir! no, sir.

- que:
  - Uh? Uh?
  ans:
  - Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.

- que:
  - Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
  ans:
  - Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

- que:
  - Romeo will answer it?
  ans:
  - Any man that can write may answer a letter.

- que:
  - Am I like Such a fellow?
  ans:
  - Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.

- que:
  - Is the day so young?
  ans:
  - But new struck cuz.

- que:
  - It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
  ans:
  - Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

- que:
  - Of love?
  ans:
  - No, cuz, I rather weep.

- que:
  - Good heart, at what?
  ans:
  - She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.

- que:
  - By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
  ans:
  - Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.

- que:
  - Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
  ans:
  - Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.

- que:
  - Young Romeo is it?
  ans:
  - Tis he.

- que:
  - Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
  ans:
  - My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.

- que:
  - Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
  ans:
  - The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

- que:
  - God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
  ans:
  - Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

- que:
  - Where is my Lady's lord?
  ans:
  - Romeo, come forth.

- que:
  - Madam, in happy time what day is that?
  ans:
  - What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!

- que:
  - What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
  ans:
  - Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.

- que:
  - I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news, I pray thee, speak.
  ans:
  - O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?

- que:
  - But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
  ans:
  - Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.

- que:
  - O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
  ans:
  - I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

- que:
  - Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
  ans:
  - I have.

- que:
  - Speakest thou from thy heart?
  ans:
  - Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

- que:
  - Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  ans:
  - Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

- que:
  -  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
  ans:
  - Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

- que:
  - Well what shall I swear by?
  ans:
  - Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.

- que:
  - What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
  ans:
  - The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

- que:
  - Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
  ans:
  - By the hour of nine.

- que:
  - Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
  ans:
  - I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.

- que:
  - If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
  ans:
  - Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

- que:
  - Why, may one ask?
  ans:
  - I dream'd a dream to-night.

- que:
  - Well, what was yours?
  ans:
  - That dreamers often lie.

- que:
  - The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
  ans:
  - OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.

- que:
  - What wouldst thou have with me?
  ans:
  - Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.

- que:
  - Is she a Capulet?
  ans:
  - His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.

- que:
  - Do you have it?
  ans:
  - Always in a rush, you are. All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.

- que:
  - Do you really think so?
  ans:
  - You know it is.

- que:
  - Why did you do that?
  ans:
  - It's under your seat.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - As my American friend Larry would say, are you fucking deaf? It's under your seat.

- que:
  - Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - While Sam and I take out the back two cars...

- que:
  - Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don't even know what it is. What did we steal?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - So where do you go from here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.

- que:
  - Who the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.

- que:
  - So what's the deal?
  ans:
  - The deal? The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.

- que:
  - How do we know that?
  ans:
  - I never did trust that blonde fuck...

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - Best beer in the world known to man or God.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?
  ans:
  - I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks, Guinness.

- que:
  - So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What in bloody hell is going on?
  ans:
  - They're part of the team. One of them's the guy I told you about.

- que:
  - From Interpol?
  ans:
  - That's him.

- que:
  - You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
  ans:
  - Good Christ! Can't you lose these jokers?

- que:
  - Do I need to repeat myself?
  ans:
  - No, Seamus. I heard you the first time.

- que:
  - You were a soldier, were you?
  ans:
  - Once.

- que:
  - I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that?
  ans:
  - I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Duty calls?
  ans:
  - Just business.

- que:
  - Now, what did we steal?
  ans:
  - Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.

- que:
  - Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
  ans:
  - I'm a patriate.

- que:
  - Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
  ans:
  - Are you alright?

- que:
  - You sure about this?
  ans:
  - I'd stake my reputation.

- que:
  - Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? What's your job?
  ans:
  - Next.

- que:
  - Where's the case?
  ans:
  - There's a problem...

- que:
  - Do you have the material?
  ans:
  - You first, Edvard.

- que:
  - Not so fast. Who's that?
  ans:
  - He's company.

- que:
  - There's been a slight problem.
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I take it you still want the money...

- que:
  - Where's my information?
  ans:
  - In here...

- que:
  - Sit, sit... Would you like one?
  ans:
  - Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.

- que:
  - Then where is it?
  ans:
  - I sent it to myself in Paris.

- que:
  - Sent it where?
  ans:
  - A post office box.

- que:
  - Is it done?
  ans:
  - It's done.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.

- que:
  - A means to an end, is that it?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Don't cross me...

- que:
  - I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. He's a cop?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - How did you know?
  ans:
  - If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.

- que:
  - Are you sure you won't have a drink?
  ans:
  - No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control. Alright, let's do it.

- que:
  - You think you can stitch me up on you own?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

- que:
  - But first you have something to take care of?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Something important? A thing that cannot wait?
  ans:
  - It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.

- que:
  - So this is what, a test?
  ans:
  - Call it a reckoning of character.

- que:
  - So what is it you want to know?
  ans:
  - I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.

- que:
  - Created?
  ans:
  - Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself. And I'm not any kind of Samurai.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - It's been known to happen.

- que:
  - Did he bring that with him?
  ans:
  - What're you talking about, man? I don't understand.

- que:
  - Who's they?
  ans:
  - Everybody.

- que:
  - Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
  ans:
  - I'm just worried about your health, Larry. You could stand to shed a few pounds.

- que:
  - Who you calling dumb, dickless?
  ans:
  - I ride with fat-boy...

- que:
  - Where is this broad?
  ans:
  - You should learn a little patience.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.

- que:
  - Perhaps the police?
  ans:
  - I know cops -- and you're no cop.

- que:
  - Cigarette?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - He trusts you to lock up?
  ans:
  - Let's just say he knows who I am.

- que:
  - Coordinate what?
  ans:
  - Things. This is my country, you know.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - To see a man about a thing.

- que:
  - As in, they own it?
  ans:
  - Something like that...

- que:
  - And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
  ans:
  - I didn't know that you spoke French.

- que:
  - What'd you say to him?
  ans:
  - I asked if we could give him anything else.

- que:
  - That was a nice move you did on our young friend. Judo?
  ans:
  - Jujitsu.

- que:
  - Same thing, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Not at all. Similar, but not the same.

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - One's a lot more painful than the other.

- que:
  - Help yourself. Since when do you smoke?
  ans:
  - I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.

- que:
  - A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - Exactly. Why not bring them?
  ans:
  - Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He's smart, Gregor is.

- que:
  - I've wondered that myself. None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me?
  ans:
  - I wanted to see who you were.

- que:
  - Who am I?
  ans:
  - They certainly are. Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.

- que:
  - Lovely, isn't it?
  ans:
  - They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to see something.

- que:
  - See what?
  ans:
  - I needed to know.

- que:
  - Know what?
  ans:
  - That there was a gun pointed at me.

- que:
  - But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
  ans:
  - Because that's what I would have done...

- que:
  - The question still remains, what do we do now?
  ans:
  - Gregor's cell phone...

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I came up here to sneak a smoke.

- que:
  - You were smoking?
  ans:
  - I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.

- que:
  - I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
  ans:
  - You don't. You just learn to live with it.

- que:
  - You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
  ans:
  - No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.

- que:
  - And what job is that?
  ans:
  - It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.

- que:
  - You see the bullet?
  ans:
  - Clearly.

- que:
  - You know him?
  ans:
  - I know of him.

- que:
  - The Irish representative?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.

- que:
  - You sure your friend got the right place?
  ans:
  - If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.

- que:
  - Dark ops?
  ans:
  - Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.

- que:
  - You were behind the door?
  ans:
  - I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.

- que:
  - You would have done that?
  ans:
  - I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.

- que:
  - How could you have done that?
  ans:
  - Because I owe you. Look at that...

- que:
  - You think?
  ans:
  - You said it yourself, Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.

- que:
  - What the fuck happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Why are you driving? You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads. Why are you driving?
  ans:
  - I'm not here very much.

- que:
  - Business keeps you on the road?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
  ans:
  - In a minute.

- que:
  - Do we need anything else?
  ans:
  - Yeah. We need out fucking heads examined.

- que:
  - Just like that?
  ans:
  - What of it? Samurai pain in the ass.

- que:
  - It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
  ans:
  - Closest and oldest.

- que:
  - And when you finish? What then? This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA? Do you really think they deserve it?
  ans:
  - That's a good question.

- que:
  - Do you have a good answer?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You speak French.

- que:
  - What of it?
  ans:
  - Nothing...

- que:
  - What happened to it?
  ans:
  - Gone. Destroyed.

- que:
  - What's the story?
  ans:
  - Gaelic.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.

- que:
  - Doing well. This is?
  ans:
  - A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.

- que:
  - Do you have the tape?
  ans:
  - I might know where you could get a copy.

- que:
  - You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
  ans:
  - All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.

- que:
  - Can you get it?
  ans:
  - Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here -- one of them's still alive.

- que:
  - I want to get some hounds down here.
  ans:
  - I'd like to know what they were doing in my town! Did you get ID off any of them?

- que:
  - Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this?
  ans:
  - I can't get enough of it.

- que:
  - How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
  ans:
  - The horniest dog in Nevada.

- que:
  - Cash and what?
  ans:
  - Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...

- que:
  - Why? Are you kidding me?
  ans:
  - No. We can't.

- que:
  - It won't work.
  ans:
  - We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows?

- que:
  - Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - What makes you so sure?
  ans:
  - Because...I know.

- que:
  - At the expense of six people.
  ans:
  - Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?

- que:
  - All right we will.
  ans:
  - All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car?

- que:
  - I've got one condition.
  ans:
  - We'll torch the bases, how's that?

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.

- que:
  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it.
  ans:
  - We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?!

- que:
  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - He would have done it to us, right?
  ans:
  - Exactly. This is our little secret, partner.

- que:
  - And how do you figure we do that?
  ans:
  - All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow.

- que:
  - We had a deal! What was I, talking to the wall?
  ans:
  - You said that last time!

- que:
  - You think he's bluffing?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're crazy.
  ans:
  - Well what are we supposed to do?

- que:
  - How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
  ans:
  - Not bad enough to kill him.

- que:
  - Do you have everything?
  ans:
  - I sure as hell hope so. Let's go.

- que:
  - It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.

- que:
  - We're not? How do you figure that?
  ans:
  - We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.

- que:
  - What happened? What's Earl doing here?
  ans:
  - He found us, he shot her...he killed her...

- que:
  - Uh huh.
  ans:
  - What are you talking about?

- que:
  - And you're solid on that?
  ans:
  - My offer? Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is...

- que:
  - I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
  ans:
  - Two thousand...

- que:
  - What are you proposing?
  ans:
  - I want my share. All of it.

- que:
  - How are ya?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - No. Why?
  ans:
  - Because someone may have gotten away.

- que:
  - Could it have been in the Mercedes?
  ans:
  - Maybe. That's where it was during Denning's last report.

- que:
  - You mean that guy was an agent?
  ans:
  - Yes. Wife and a kid. Don't blame yourself, Deputy. You did all you could. You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Denning was wearing a bug.

- que:
  - Yeah? So?
  ans:
  - It's odd. I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I gotta take some money out, that's what for.

- que:
  - Has he?
  ans:
  - No. But he would, probably.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Oh. You coming by tonight?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - Are you sure you're OK?
  ans:
  - Yeah I'm fine.

- que:
  - I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
  ans:
  - OK. I love you.

- que:
  - You got me something? What's the occasion?
  ans:
  - You deserve it is the occasion.

- que:
  - Nothing happened?
  ans:
  - Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.

- que:
  - Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
  ans:
  - Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me.

- que:
  - Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
  ans:
  - I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.

- que:
  - How the hell did he find it?
  ans:
  - He started digging through my closet, something he never does.

- que:
  - It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
  ans:
  - I used to think he was something, once... I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.

- que:
  - A satellite dish?
  ans:
  - Well I was just throwing out ideas...

- que:
  - How are we going to do all this?
  ans:
  - I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him.

- que:
  - When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
  ans:
  - Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.

- que:
  - Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
  ans:
  - It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here...

- que:
  - Why does that bother you?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...

- que:
  - Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up?
  ans:
  - I don't know. My friends...

- que:
  - Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I want to tell you everything.

- que:
  - Sally, do you love me?
  ans:
  - You know I do.

- que:
  - What did he buy?
  ans:
  - I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.

- que:
  - Could it have been this?
  ans:
  - Be more specific. A month, a week...

- que:
  - Test the product?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
  ans:
  - You said that, I didn't.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I have a better plan.

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - How about you give us what you have and leave.

- que:
  - Am I speaking English here? How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
  ans:
  - What is this? Don't be stupid man...

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - Hell, I don't know. If I had some input I'd offer it up.

- que:
  - That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.

- que:
  - What are you getting at?
  ans:
  - Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.

- que:
  - Why would someone do that?
  ans:
  - Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.

- que:
  - Don't you have to be here?
  ans:
  - Mm-hmm...

- que:
  - Have you known this all along?
  ans:
  - Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.

- que:
  - Is this marked money, or what?
  ans:
  - Some of it. Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.

- que:
  - What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.

- que:
  - Hi.
  ans:
  - Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?

- que:
  - Anything I can help you with?
  ans:
  - Well I just uh, you know...

- que:
  - Anything...specific?
  ans:
  - Well I don't know...

- que:
  - Shopping here?
  ans:
  - No, I can't say that I have.

- que:
  - C?
  ans:
  - Yeah I'd say C...C.

- que:
  - No I don't. You sure you havent seen her?
  ans:
  - Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.

- que:
  - A lot of men come in here?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers. All types. Even had an officer, just like you.

- que:
  - All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
  ans:
  - No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.

- que:
  - Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - Jesse?
  ans:
  - Yeah whaddya want?.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Uh, sure. I hear you.

- que:
  - Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
  ans:
  - Well I'm here now.

- que:
  - No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
  ans:
  - You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.

- que:
  - Nothing. Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
  ans:
  - Not much to tell. Nothing really happened.

- que:
  - Don't you want to hear about my day?
  ans:
  - Yeah let's hear about your day.

- que:
  - Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
  ans:
  - Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace! Is that asking too much?

- que:
  - Then what the hell are you all about?
  ans:
  - I'll settle for a third of that.

- que:
  - True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
  ans:
  - We're out of here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I was on a roll! Im a little overextended now.

- que:
  - Is that the mail?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How's work?
  ans:
  - Well, same ol' same ol'.

- que:
  - Did they ever find out who they were?
  ans:
  - Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.

- que:
  - Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey -- I've got a surprise.

- que:
  - And what happened?
  ans:
  - Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...

- que:
  - This whole place?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Figured you could have it.

- que:
  - Don't you want it?
  ans:
  - Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.

- que:
  - Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it?
  ans:
  - Absolutely positively.

- que:
  - You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
  ans:
  - Give me the bad news.

- que:
  - Anything in it?
  ans:
  - Money.

- que:
  - That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane.

- que:
  - So...what's the good news?
  ans:
  - That fire was set. Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.

- que:
  - No, it doesn't. Neither does his blank tape. Any news on that?
  ans:
  - We're going to find out.

- que:
  - What do you think? Heart attack?
  ans:
  - It's nine-thirty in the morning.

- que:
  - I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why?
  ans:
  - Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - Those are five hundred dollar chips.

- que:
  - Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
  ans:
  - No, I just assumed...

- que:
  - You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right? Are you a racist?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Wait.
  ans:
  - Winner six!

- que:
  - Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced. Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says. Where is he?
  ans:
  - Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.

- que:
  - What? Where'd you hear that?
  ans:
  - I got my sources.

- que:
  - How'd you know?
  ans:
  - So tell me what you know.

- que:
  - I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I knew it. The guy's name is Zing. He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

- que:
  - This is your ship?
  ans:
  - That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

- que:
  - Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a beautiful yacht. What's it called?
  ans:
  - I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht. And it's his party.

- que:
  - So what's your story?
  ans:
  - They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

- que:
  - How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
  ans:
  - They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.

- que:
  - What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
  ans:
  - The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.

- que:
  - Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
  ans:
  - I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist. I got proof. See, I got a mini-bar key.

- que:
  - Do you have it in you, Lee? Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
  ans:
  - C'mon, Lee. He's going to jail. You won, now just put the gun down.

- que:
  - Oh, you American?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - You bring American money?
  ans:
  - Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money.

- que:
  - You get massage from Chinese girl before?
  ans:
  - No. It's my first time.

- que:
  - Wait a second. You're Steven Reign? You're big time. You own all them big hotels. What are you doing in Hong Kong?
  ans:
  - I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.

- que:
  - Vegas has been my town for 30 years. I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
  ans:
  - You're right, you're a smart guy. Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar. But this is an even swap. Pure genius.

- que:
  - Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
  ans:
  - Mu-shu? You're hungry?

- que:
  - That's what I'm talking about. A real Hong Kong night club. You want an Altoid?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Just relax and don't worry about a thing. I'll hook you up in there. You got condoms?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going?
  ans:
  - Bathroom.

- que:
  - Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?
  ans:
  - Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.

- que:
  - What'd I say?
  ans:
  - Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.

- que:
  - How you doin'?
  ans:
  - My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - She said I could pick any girl I want.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I have plenty of dates.

- que:
  - Really? When's the last time you had some Mu-shu Let's hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat?
  ans:
  - Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.

- que:
  - What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
  ans:
  - I'm okay, you go.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
  ans:
  - I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

- que:
  - Good at what?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - How the hell did Tan get away with it?
  ans:
  - All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal. Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.

- que:
  - Why LA?
  ans:
  - I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.

- que:
  - Follow the Rich White Man?
  ans:
  - Almost, but you've got to say \"Rich White Man\" all run together like it's one word.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.

- que:
  - The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. Gefilte Fish. Lox and bagel. I love this stuff. Here, try it with a smear.
  ans:
  - How do you know he's our man?

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.

- que:
  - You pull a muscle or something?
  ans:
  - My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
  ans:
  - It's a long story.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - She's just standing around -- not doing much.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I said nothing.

- que:
  - Is it hot in here?
  ans:
  - Hot? I'm freezing my ass off.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - She's getting undressed.

- que:
  - What's she doing?
  ans:
  - Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired...

- que:
  - I don't understand?
  ans:
  - She's walking back towards the door.

- que:
  - Let me see it again?
  ans:
  - We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty.

- que:
  - Why did you help me?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter.

- que:
  - I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
  ans:
  - Yes. We have heaven.

- que:
  - What's a Chinese heaven?
  ans:
  - I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in.

- que:
  - You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How was the sex?
  ans:
  - There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married.

- que:
  - You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mu-shu?
  ans:
  - No mu-shu.

- que:
  - What about a little king pao chicken?
  ans:
  - No kung pao chicken. Never.

- que:
  - Steamed dumplings?
  ans:
  - Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Forget it. It doesn't matter.

- que:
  - That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
  ans:
  - They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.

- que:
  - Who's Benjamin?
  ans:
  - Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.

- que:
  - What is Mac out?
  ans:
  - Follow me my Asian brother.

- que:
  - Lee, what the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - It was Isabella. She says the plates are in the soft count room.

- que:
  - That your gate down there?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - About fifty grand. I won it at the tables.

- que:
  - New York City?
  ans:
  - First class.

- que:
  - The Plaza Hotel?
  ans:
  - A little Mu-shu.

- que:
  - Some Kung-Pao?
  ans:
  - I could use a little vacation.

- que:
  - Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
  ans:
  - What \"revenge\" is he talking about?

- que:
  - No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
  ans:
  - And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I need your help.

- que:
  - Why don't you go get them?
  ans:
  - If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

- que:
  - I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
  ans:
  - No. But I'll help you.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
  ans:
  - No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

- que:
  - Baby Duck?
  ans:
  - That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking. Never shut up.

- que:
  - Do you still have the bills?
  ans:
  - I still have my lunch money from third grade.

- que:
  - Any leads?
  ans:
  - We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.

- que:
  - The Secret Service? Why?
  ans:
  - All he wanted was some mu-shu.

- que:
  - Did you tell Sterling?
  ans:
  - Let him find out on his own. I want the Hong Kong police handling this.

- que:
  - Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
  ans:
  - Yes, Master.

- que:
  - Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
  ans:
  - Ricky Tan?

- que:
  - STERLING Who the hell is that?
  ans:
  - That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation.

- que:
  - Fifty million! Are we talkin' United States dollars?
  ans:
  - In used currency. Nothing bigger than a fifty.

- que:
  - What is your name?
  ans:
  - That's cool. We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.

- que:
  - Feds asked for me?
  ans:
  - They asked for the best street man I had.

- que:
  - You have one of these?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're full of shit. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
  ans:
  - Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That silly-ass look on your face.

- que:
  - Where were we?
  ans:
  - Witnesses.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - I know a shortcut.

- que:
  - He was trying to kill me, not you.
  ans:
  - Shortcut?

- que:
  - Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours?
  ans:
  - It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.

- que:
  - What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
  ans:
  - No. I just made it up.

- que:
  - Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight, did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
  ans:
  - Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself. And he dropped this.

- que:
  - When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear? This is my man, you dig? My informant. You know what an informant is?
  ans:
  - Stooly.

  - Took off. Yes. They took off.

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's good.

  ans:
  - No, no. I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas. scuse me.

  - No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it.
  ans:
  - You know War?

- que:

  ans:
  - I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.

- que:
  - Want some?
  ans:
  - No, fish is a PM food.

- que:

  ans:
  - Going into the restaurant.

  - What do you hear?
  ans:
  - OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.

  ans:
  - Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The art.

- que:
  - It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo. My country asked for the best. I told them that was you. Now I will show you around my hood.
  ans:
  - You know him?

- que:
  - No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to?
  ans:
  - Oh, I think you like this very much.

- que:
  - Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
  ans:
  - Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

- que:
  - Where'd you get it?
  ans:
  - You're killin' me here.

- que:
  - No...what?
  ans:
  - I could get promoted right out of here.

- que:
  - They put you in charge?
  ans:
  - In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I.

  - Yeah. So why you look do down?
  ans:
  - Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.

  - How about a lift home?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.

- que:
  - Any demands yet?
  ans:
  - At this point we don't have much.

- que:
  - How much they want?
  ans:
  - You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.

- que:
  - What kind of assignment is that?
  ans:
  - Bottom line, I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.

- que:
  - Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
  ans:
  - Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.

- que:
  - What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
  ans:
  - Don't play bullshit games with me.

- que:
  - Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
  ans:
  - Or somethin'.

- que:
  - What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

  - You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
  ans:
  - Do it!

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!

  - Can I speak with her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

  - Han?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You have what I asked for?

  - When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
  ans:
  - I still have work to do here.

- que:
  - After I left?
  ans:
  - I will not have friends in America.

- que:
  - What is he up to now?
  ans:
  - Ike just came by to check out the team.

- que:
  - Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
  ans:
  - I'm just bragging about how great you are. I'm the luckiest man alive.

- que:
  - At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
  ans:
  - Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.

- que:
  - Let me take you back inside, okay?
  ans:
  - Ahh.

- que:
  - How about -- \"I hope you'll be very happy together\"?
  ans:
  - You look awful.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.

- que:
  - Got any last minute advice?
  ans:
  - Maintain eye contact.

- que:
  - What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.

- que:
  - How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
  ans:
  - Good one! Thanks.

- que:
  - I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
  ans:
  - -- It's for you, Ike.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.

- que:
  - Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze- hound in a bar?
  ans:
  - No, that's what makes you unemployed.

- que:
  - See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.

- que:
  - Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you?
  ans:
  - Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout. That's New York living.

- que:
  - Or a vegetarian?
  ans:
  - Look, he's running after her.

- que:
  - What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
  ans:
  - Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.

- que:
  - But I'll get my normal fee, right?
  ans:
  - Don't say \"spec\" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book advance...

- que:
  - No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You're coming here?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?
  ans:
  - Get this man a Kamikaze.

- que:
  - Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?
  ans:
  - Not bad. I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.

- que:
  - Why do YOU think she ran?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.

- que:
  - And you defending her?
  ans:
  - No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.

- que:
  - I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
  ans:
  - Good fact. Well, you let me know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - About her upcoming wedding and all.

- que:
  - I am just such a reporter. And you are?
  ans:
  - Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.

- que:
  - And you are?
  ans:
  - Looking for Maggie.

- que:
  - Have you listened to his morning show, \"Wake up with ballplayer\"?
  ans:
  - Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.

- que:
  - Yes, I am. And who are you?
  ans:
  - Betty Trout. Five dollars.

- que:
  - Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...?
  ans:
  - Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.

- que:
  - Getting nervous?
  ans:
  - Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never been more certain in my life. Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.

- que:
  - Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did something happen to make you care about reality?
  ans:
  - You're going to be very disappointed.

- que:
  - Everest. Is that right?
  ans:
  - Twice...

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Without oxygen...

- que:
  - You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
  ans:
  - You can turn that finger around.

- que:
  - I'm not a boastful man. What's your point?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
  ans:
  - Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.

- que:
  - You afraid to try?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.

- que:
  - Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
  ans:
  - Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.

- que:
  - Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
  ans:
  - You know, there's no...

- que:
  - Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
  ans:
  - No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible.

- que:
  - Can you fix it?
  ans:
  - First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.

- que:
  - Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
  ans:
  - I already explained about that.

- que:
  - Brian told you that?
  ans:
  - Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.

- que:
  - What!?
  ans:
  - No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.

- que:
  - About a minute...?
  ans:
  - A little longer for me.

- que:
  - Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.

- que:
  - So, we'll...
  ans:
  - To who? Are you asking me?

- que:
  - It's something I've always wanted to do.
  ans:
  - I've been making friends with your cat. Is it okay that I'm here?

- que:
  - You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.

- que:
  - Does it matter?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did.

- que:
  - Used?
  ans:
  - They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.

- que:
  - I was, because if you said \"yes\" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part. And I've been practicing it. Ready?
  ans:
  - I'm listening.

- que:
  - Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
  ans:
  - I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?

- que:
  - She's the boss.
  ans:
  - Reporter?

- que:
  - For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?
  ans:
  - That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.

- que:
  - There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
  ans:
  - Ya think?

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those \"sources say\" things.

- que:
  - Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
  ans:
  - I'm going to kill myself.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because you think I'm all like... \"Hey man, check me out\".

- que:
  - I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
  ans:
  - Something that brings warmth to my heart. Duckbill platypus.

- que:
  - Thanks. Will you fix my hair?
  ans:
  - Lighten up, wahine.

- que:
  - Lighten up, what?
  ans:
  - This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter.

- que:
  - He's going to be the pastor?
  ans:
  - Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.

- que:
  - ... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this?
  ans:
  - It's for the bell.

- que:
  - Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just going to head home.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Wedding. Wedding. You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.

- que:
  - Is there somebody else?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - You don't love me, is that it?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - What am I going to do with a microwave?
  ans:
  - You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.

- que:
  - Am I what they had in mind?
  ans:
  - They're going to love you.

- que:
  - Is that all right with you?
  ans:
  - Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

- que:
  - I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Even when you were young?
  ans:
  - Nope. Not even when I was young.

- que:
  - You sure you don't want to drive with me?
  ans:
  - How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday? Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.

- que:
  - We will? The Symphony? Okay. I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
  ans:
  - Walter, I'd love to --

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's delicious, trust me.

- que:
  - Does it have wheat in it?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again. Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.

- que:
  - Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
  ans:
  - Not for the kind of place I want to do. I won't be in Chicago that long.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - About forever.

- que:
  - Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
  ans:
  - Beautiful view, isn't it?

- que:
  - I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
  ans:
  - So what happened?

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yes. Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Nothing's with me.

- que:
  - \"Sleepless in Seattle\"?
  ans:
  - I'm going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system.

- que:
  - I don't know. I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
  ans:
  - Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.

- que:
  - And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
  ans:
  - Plus he fell in love with a temp.

- que:
  - Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
  ans:
  - The kid is on. You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.

- que:
  - I couldn't do it. How did I get here?
  ans:
  - You told a lie and got on a plane.

- que:
  - Is this crazy?
  ans:
  - No. That's the weirdest part about it.

- que:
  - You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
  ans:
  - I love that dream.

- que:
  - But he saw you, right?
  ans:
  - He said hello.

- que:
  - Becky?
  ans:
  - Made for each other.

- que:
  - What about the letter?
  ans:
  - It doesn't mean anything. It was written before I went out there. Before the ho.

- que:
  - What are your plans in New York?
  ans:
  - We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.

- que:
  - That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home. I quit. Laurie, I quit. I'm going back to Baltimore. How does a blonde do a high- five?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?
  ans:
  - Howard.

- que:
  - I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married. So we get married.
  ans:
  - I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do. Are you happily married?

- que:
  - But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
  ans:
  - I don't even know him. But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.

- que:
  - Are his folks nice?
  ans:
  - You'll love them. We're going down to D.C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning.

- que:
  - How did it happen?
  ans:
  - How amazing.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Magic. It was magic.

- que:
  - Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working?
  ans:
  - Like... clockwork.

- que:
  - It's you.
  ans:
  - Shhhh --

- que:
  - It's me?
  ans:
  - Grace heard it.

- que:
  - Why me? What about Jay?
  ans:
  - Thanks, but I'll pass. It's kind of a big night. I don't like to leave Jonah alone.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - FIELDSTONE Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE Good. How long ago did your wife die?
  ans:
  - It's been about a year and a half.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE Have you had any relationship since?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE And I don't want to invade your privacy --
  ans:
  - FIELDSTONE Why not?

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
  ans:
  - It's hard to imagine.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE What are you going to do, Sam?
  ans:
  - I don't know. When I met my wife, it was so clear. I just knew.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE What was it that made you know?
  ans:
  - I don't think I could really describe it.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late?
  ans:
  - It's not that late in Seattle.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
  ans:
  - It's not for me. It's for my dad. I think he needs a new wife.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE You don't like the one he was now?
  ans:
  - He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE Where's your mom?
  ans:
  - She died.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE Why not?
  ans:
  - It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff. It's like it makes him sadder.

- que:
  - FIELDSTONE Is he home right now?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
  ans:
  - Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

- que:
  - How about rapacious and love- starved?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When's the latest time you were out there?
  ans:
  - Seventy... eight.

- que:
  - What's tira misu?
  ans:
  - You'll find out.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - You'll see.

- que:
  - Dad, could you close the door?
  ans:
  - H and G. Hi and goodbye.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - It's Y. O. H.

- que:
  - Yeah. What's that?
  ans:
  - Your only hope.

- que:
  - Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?
  ans:
  - Eighty dollars.

- que:
  - Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
  ans:
  - Window.

- que:
  - I don't know. Do I?
  ans:
  - There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.

- que:
  - It's never happening again. Right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
  ans:
  - Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
  ans:
  - I think I know how to have a spice rack.

- que:
  - How did they get our phone number?
  ans:
  - You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.

- que:
  - \"Dear Sleepless in Seattle, I am an SWF\"-- What is that?
  ans:
  - Somewhere in the middle.

- que:
  - I'm starting to notice that.
  ans:
  - This is not how you do it. You want this on an English muffin or a bun?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff. When they're having sex.

- que:
  - Whose show was this on?
  ans:
  - Jed's got cables.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - It was sinking.

- que:
  - What was?
  ans:
  - Our house. There was water coming in all the windows.

- que:
  - I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Like do you believe in heaven?
  ans:
  - I'm starting to forget her.

- que:
  - She's going to cook something for us?
  ans:
  - Okay, tiger. Time for bed.

- que:
  - What are you doing up?
  ans:
  - I was thirsty.

- que:
  - Did you call that radio station again?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Was Mom an adjustment?
  ans:
  - God, she's beautiful.

- que:
  - Who is Annie?
  ans:
  - The one who wrote us.

- que:
  - Have you seen my wallet?
  ans:
  - It might be in the kitchen.

- que:
  - Are you going with her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's wrong with Annie?
  ans:
  - I was scared of what you were gonna do.

- que:
  - When I found you?
  ans:
  - If I didn't go.

- que:
  - Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
  ans:
  - I went camping once. I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - You must be Jonah.

- que:
  - Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done. Ready to eat. Do you know how to make juice?
  ans:
  - He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later. It's so beautiful here.

- que:
  - You saw her in the airport and then here?
  ans:
  - I tried to talk to her... It was like I knew her. Weird.

- que:
  - It's a little derivative.
  ans:
  - How's Jonah taking it?

- que:
  - Anyway, Victoria's nice.
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - Would you follow her through an airport?
  ans:
  - Look, I met somebody. She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off. We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.

- que:
  - I've already solved it. I've hired a hit man.
  ans:
  - You did?

- que:
  - Is he there?
  ans:
  - Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.

- que:
  - Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - You're welcome to one.

- que:
  - Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
  ans:
  - There's nothing stopping you.

- que:
  - How's it going?
  ans:
  - Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.

- que:
  - Whose side are you on anyway?
  ans:
  - Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I don't make policy.

- que:
  - Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
  ans:
  - It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.

- que:
  - Jenkins ain't no boss. Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
  ans:
  - You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.

- que:
  - How goes it?
  ans:
  - It never ends.

- que:
  - The woman question?
  ans:
  - Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.

- que:
  - So? What does he want to do about 'em?
  ans:
  - He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.

- que:
  - What do you mean -- sex equality?
  ans:
  - You know ... What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

- que:
  - Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse? Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
  ans:
  - You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.

- que:
  - Who? A scab?
  ans:
  - An American.

- que:
  - Are you sick, Mama?
  ans:
  - No, Estellita.

- que:
  - Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
  ans:
  - Later. When I finish the ironing.

- que:
  - Why are they singing, Mama?
  ans:
  - They are singing for me.

- que:
  - Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
  ans:
  - Yes. We will light the candles.

- que:
  - To the mine?
  ans:
  - Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.

- que:
  - I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
  ans:
  - It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - Got to talk to the brothers.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.

- que:
  - What's more important than sanitation?
  ans:
  - First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.

- que:
  - What has it got me, your union?
  ans:
  - What has it got me, your union?

- que:
  - Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
  ans:
  - I'm a fool.

- que:
  - Was it expensive, the beer?
  ans:
  - Antonio paid for it.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. Just a little catch ...

- que:
  - A fighter, huh?
  ans:
  - He was born fighting. And born hungry.

- que:
  - What were they saying? About you? In there?
  ans:
  - They say I am no good to you.

- que:
  - What makes you so sure?
  ans:
  - Let them take it!

- que:
  - Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
  ans:
  - It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.

- que:
  - Can be what?
  ans:
  - Backward.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Must've been some experience for you, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm going back tomorrow.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.

- que:
  - Four nights. How did you sleep?
  ans:
  - We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.

- que:
  - Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
  ans:
  - No, no ... we wouldn't do it.

- que:
  - A meeting?
  ans:
  - Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.

- que:
  - That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
  ans:
  - Be still ...

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Hunting.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Sun up.

- que:
  - Alone?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You mean you're ready to give up?
  ans:
  - Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
  ans:
  - Shut up, you're talking crazy.

- que:
  - This is what we've been waiting for.
  ans:
  - Will you be still?

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - This means they've given up trying to break the picket line. Now we can all fight together -- all of us.

- que:
  - Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
  ans:
  - Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.

- que:
  - You mean Delaware?
  ans:
  - No. New York.

- que:
  - New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
  ans:
  - No ...

- que:
  - Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President. But you've come out here to settle the strike?
  ans:
  - Well, if that's possible ...

- que:
  - What are you doing here? Something wrong with Mama?
  ans:
  - I thought maybe you forgot...

- que:
  - Forgot what?
  ans:
  - She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.

- que:
  - I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
  ans:
  - Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...

- que:
  - Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
  ans:
  - I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.

- que:
  - What attitude?
  ans:
  - You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.

- que:
  - He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.

- que:
  - Are you Australian?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
  ans:
  - Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty. Just kinda' filthy is all.

- que:
  - You mind?
  ans:
  - No, I don't mind. That's how come I told you about it.

- que:
  - Bobby?
  ans:
  - Shhh.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The spiders.

- que:
  - What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Come on. Ease off the girl.

- que:
  - Not even a guess?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but he was in silhouette.

- que:
  - How about in the house?
  ans:
  - They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's downright classy is what it is.

- que:
  - Everything go?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.

- que:
  - What about the guy on the very bottom?
  ans:
  - Leave me out of this.

- que:
  - That bad, huh?
  ans:
  - Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
  ans:
  - It's not that easy.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You don't understand.

- que:
  - You get off on abuse or something?
  ans:
  - Fuck you.

- que:
  - Why don't you call the cops?
  ans:
  - Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Oh. Hi.

- que:
  - Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. Where's Quincey?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. He's out of town.

- que:
  - How far out of town?
  ans:
  - Trust me. We're safe.

- que:
  - Like you?
  ans:
  - Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.

- que:
  - And you admire that?
  ans:
  - It's the only way to play.

- que:
  - Is that how you play?
  ans:
  - I try.

- que:
  - What are you up to?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
  ans:
  - It gets me through the day.

- que:
  - How much time do you have?
  ans:
  - You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.

- que:
  - Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
  ans:
  - There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.

- que:
  - What are you hiding, Danny?
  ans:
  - Therapy session is over.

- que:
  - You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
  ans:
  - No. But I'm the only one with my sad story. And that's how it's gonna stay.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's me.

- que:
  - You always been this stubborn?
  ans:
  - From day one. I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Danny?
  ans:
  - Look, maybe you oughta' leave.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.

- que:
  - How you holding up?
  ans:
  - Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's Tom.

- que:
  - All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
  ans:
  - Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.

- que:
  - Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
  ans:
  - I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

- que:
  - Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
  ans:
  - You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.

- que:
  - How the hell did we get this detail?
  ans:
  - Guess it's our turn.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - My features. They're Finnish.

- que:
  - Was. I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man. You got anything for me?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Why does it have to feel so bad?
  ans:
  - You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here. Have a beer.

- que:
  - So, why'd you want to see me?
  ans:
  - Business. I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit. You got language skills, man.

- que:
  - You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
  ans:
  - I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.

- que:
  - Can you set that up?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Jimmy, where do you find these people?
  ans:
  - The Del Ammo Mall mostly.

- que:
  - You wanna score some go-fast?
  ans:
  - Not tonight.

- que:
  - Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
  ans:
  - Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.

- que:
  - Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
  ans:
  - I think on account of his nose.

- que:
  - You want a hit?
  ans:
  - No. I'm good.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Sure, Jimmy.

- que:
  - What does J.F.K. stand for?
  ans:
  - John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had.

- que:
  - No one ever noticed?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.

- que:
  - But... why? Why would you pretend?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you.

- que:
  - You don't trust me?
  ans:
  - I don't trust anybody.

- que:
  - Wait If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
  ans:
  - I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.

- que:
  - Nah... I want to keep it. Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
  ans:
  - Good for you Jimmy.

- que:
  - Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
  ans:
  - That was my idea.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - You don't understand.

- que:
  - Understand what?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Would you like a taste?
  ans:
  - No, I'm good.

- que:
  - Can we talk price?
  ans:
  - Make me an offer.

- que:
  - I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
  ans:
  - I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.

- que:
  - You're serious?
  ans:
  - Anything for a dear friend.

- que:
  - So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
  ans:
  - If you say so.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.

- que:
  - You want to do this some other time?
  ans:
  - Pull your pants down.

- que:
  - I'm sorry?
  ans:
  - Pull your motherfucking pants down.

- que:
  - What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
  ans:
  - No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.

- que:
  - Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
  ans:
  - I'll keep that in mind.

- que:
  - What the hell is this?
  ans:
  - Just some buddies.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
  ans:
  - Cool it. We got business.

- que:
  - You got a name?
  ans:
  - Bobby, rhymes with hobby.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.

- que:
  - No last name?
  ans:
  - It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.

- que:
  - You think I'm a Judas?
  ans:
  - Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.

- que:
  - Don't you wonder why I do it?
  ans:
  - The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.

- que:
  - You don't find that repugnant?
  ans:
  - Just the way the world works. Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.

- que:
  - Tell me what?
  ans:
  - If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Soon. I promise. We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.

- que:
  - Question is, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I was trying to score some dope.

- que:
  - Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
  ans:
  - Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.

  - You think this is funny motherfucker?
  ans:
  - I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.

- que:
  - This chink have a name?
  ans:
  - Bubba.

- que:
  - Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
  ans:
  - Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear. I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.

- que:
  - Whata you mean I've got no choice?
  ans:
  - Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...

- que:
  - You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
  ans:
  - That's because he doesn't have one.

- que:
  - What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
  ans:
  - That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.

- que:
  - What? Is it bad?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so, Danny.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.

- que:
  - Danny?
  ans:
  - My name is Tom.

- que:
  - Whatever you say, man. Look ... can we talk about this?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ... You're in the bathroom. You've been shot in the shoulder ...

- que:
  - Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You're a bottom feader, Flynne.

- que:
  - Yeah. What about him?
  ans:
  - Turns out he's connected.

- que:
  - And what does this have to do with me?
  ans:
  - He knows somebody ratted him.

- que:
  - Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
  ans:
  - We know what's going on.

- que:
  - Who the hell is Jimmy?
  ans:
  - He's the only one I told.

- que:
  - What's on the other end of this thing?
  ans:
  - Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.

- que:
  - What's that smell?
  ans:
  - That would be me.

- que:
  - Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
  ans:
  - Who'd have thought it? Danny \"Chickenshit\" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Several possession charges, but nothing major.

- que:
  - Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
  ans:
  - They have. But they never found a lab.

- que:
  - Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
  ans:
  - Worse. Much worse. A teacher.

- que:
  - When is the deal going down?
  ans:
  - You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.

- que:
  - With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
  ans:
  - A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

- que:
  - Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
  ans:
  - Tom, quit fucking around.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Look at that place. It's creepy.

- que:
  - First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't. Which is it?
  ans:
  - I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.

- que:
  - Just no pleasing you, is there?
  ans:
  - Just admit you're wrong.

- que:
  - We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
  ans:
  - Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.

- que:
  - You thinking what I'm thinking?
  ans:
  - Yeah. This could be the one we're looking for.

- que:
  - Don't we always take good care of you?
  ans:
  - She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.

- que:
  - Where's Bubba?
  ans:
  - Maybe he isn't showing.

- que:
  - What is it, drugs?
  ans:
  - Better than drugs.

- que:
  - What is that? Rum and coke?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
  ans:
  - No, you can't taste it. It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.

- que:
  - Resistance?
  ans:
  - A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.

- que:
  - Casualties?
  ans:
  - Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

- que:
  - Where are your men now?

  - Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.

- que:
  - A private, sir?
  ans:
  - He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.

- que:
  - You writin' a book or somethin'?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact, I am.

- que:
  - In West Fork?
  ans:
  - In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.

- que:
  - What about the Captain? Where's he from?
  ans:
  - Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.

- que:
  - The Army gave you that?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - You take account of the wind?
  ans:
  - Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.

- que:
  - Jackson?
  ans:
  - Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

- que:
  - You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
  ans:
  - Hell, no. I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.

- que:
  - They got squirrels there, too, right?
  ans:
  - Last I knew.

- que:
  - Shut up, will you?
  ans:
  - You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

- que:
  - You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
  ans:
  - Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.

- que:
  - Cap'n...?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

- que:
  - I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
  ans:
  - He ain't half-bad, I guess.

- que:
  - What deal?
  ans:
  - Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In the shadow by those two trees.

- que:
  - What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
  ans:
  - Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.

- que:
  - Who's Wade?
  ans:
  - Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.

- que:
  - Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
  ans:
  - It's worth it.

- que:
  - White-walls?
  ans:
  - No white-walls, sir, there's a war on. NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE! I can't help you, sir.

- que:
  - How about that jeep?
  ans:
  - A paratrooper named Ryan. He's going home, if he's alive.

- que:
  - Senator's son?
  ans:
  - Glad of it.

- que:
  - Upham?
  ans:
  - Pass.

- que:
  - Sarge?
  ans:
  - I wasn't made for this.

- que:
  - You think the rest of us were?
  ans:
  - It looks like a Renoir.

- que:
  - Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
  ans:
  - I've been humming it.

  - You know classical music?
  ans:
  - Some.

  - Where are you from, Captain?

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - A machine gun.

- que:
  - What about our grenades?
  ans:
  - Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.

- que:
  - Sure, you got one?
  ans:
  - The Germans do.

- que:
  - What'd you say, Captain?
  ans:
  - I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.

- que:
  - Captain, what about our deal?
  ans:
  - I changed my mind.

- que:
  - You tryin' to get yourself killed?
  ans:
  - Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.

- que:
  - Caen?
  ans:
  - I wish. You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.

- que:
  - You? Leading a squad?

- que:
  - You got me. Afraid of bad news?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - You think they'll be alright?
  ans:
  - They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.

- que:
  - And what about you?
  ans:
  - They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.

- que:
  - Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - It doesn't take this.

- que:
  - Is it getting worse?
  ans:
  - No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it.

- que:
  - Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot. He's done this before.
  ans:
  - Yeah? What rule of thumb is that?

- que:
  - You alright?
  ans:
  - Let's just find someplace.

- que:
  - What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
  ans:
  - Vecchio.

  - Bits and pieces.

- que:
  - And what about your own hand?
  ans:
  - It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.

- que:
  - And how do you bluff yourself?
  ans:
  - Except this time, the mission IS a man.

- que:
  - You want me to take over?
  ans:
  - No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.

- que:
  - What are we going to do?
  ans:
  - We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.

- que:
  - Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
  ans:
  - Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.

- que:
  - Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.

- que:
  - Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
  ans:
  - There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.

- que:
  - No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?
  ans:
  - Trust me, you're the best.

- que:
  - Captain, can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Sure, Reiben.

- que:
  - Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
  ans:
  - Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.

- que:
  - Yeah, how so?
  ans:
  - Ours is not to reason why.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
  ans:
  - Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.

- que:
  - Any further thoughts on the subject?
  ans:
  - I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.

- que:
  - I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
  ans:
  - Well now I'm saying we're moving out. Get off your ass.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - Except for the last part, that one's not bad.

- que:
  - Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - What if our guys open up, sir?
  ans:
  - You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.

- que:
  - This bridge cannot be held. The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here. They have tanks.
  ans:
  - I wonder if his cabin is still available?

- que:
  - The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way. You hear me, Private?
  ans:
  - I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah. I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
  ans:
  - Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.

- que:
  - And Sarge?
  ans:
  - Sarge? He was the best friend I ever had. Lemme tell you about Sarge...

- que:
  - Frogs?
  ans:
  - Lingerie.

- que:
  - Yeah? So?
  ans:
  - I usually like surprises.

- que:
  - What are we likely to run into?
  ans:
  - Damn fool. Sir.

- que:
  - So, where are you from?
  ans:
  - Get lost.

- que:
  - How do you do it?
  ans:
  - It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...

- que:
  - You think he really believed it?
  ans:
  - Who knows? It worked.

- que:
  - How fast?
  ans:
  - Twenty-four-five.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - Look, why don't you check it out for yourself? See if your father fits the profile.

- que:
  - What's the profile?
  ans:
  - You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.

- que:
  - How can you, how can you say that?
  ans:
  - Because he's guilty.

- que:
  - So you refuse to answer my questions?
  ans:
  - Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake. I have people here.

- que:
  - Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
  ans:
  - Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims. I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.

- que:
  - Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter.

- que:
  - For going to school?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she won a fellowship.

- que:
  - Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind.

- que:
  - Lloyd?
  ans:
  - Hey, sis.

- que:
  - Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
  ans:
  - Why do you eat that stuff? There's no food in your food. Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.

- que:
  - How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
  ans:
  - Gee, it's easy.

- que:
  - I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
  ans:
  - No, no, don't go in there.

- que:
  - Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
  ans:
  - I'll be home soon.

- que:
  - The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
  ans:
  - But you never had a first date.

- que:
  - What's a scam?
  ans:
  - Going out as friends.

- que:
  - Then what's love?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna call her.

- que:
  - Please?
  ans:
  - That's just so embarrassing.

- que:
  - Did you sleep with her?
  ans:
  - I admit nothing.

- que:
  - So, what's your point?
  ans:
  - You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement.

- que:
  - What does it say?
  ans:
  - Read it.

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.

- que:
  - \"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd.\" I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
  ans:
  - I dream about it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.

- que:
  - What is wrong with this girl?
  ans:
  - Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.

- que:
  - One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
  ans:
  - One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.

- que:
  - Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
  ans:
  - Visit her at the home.

- que:
  - Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
  ans:
  - Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.

- que:
  - No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
  ans:
  - Everybody thinks I'm a priss.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I just had a phone call.

- que:
  - Tell me, is it bad news?
  ans:
  - No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.

- que:
  - I won?
  ans:
  - God, I'll have to go on a plane.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.

- que:
  - Now why can't I tell the story?
  ans:
  - Well, let me start it. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.

- que:
  - Lloyd?
  ans:
  - Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.

- que:
  - Did he ever get rough with you?
  ans:
  - Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.

- que:
  - Do you love him?
  ans:
  - I like him a lot.

- que:
  - Dad, are you okay in there?
  ans:
  - Just finishing up in here.

- que:
  - Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
  ans:
  - Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.

- que:
  - You think you know what this money is?
  ans:
  - Yes, I...

- que:
  - Why are you being so hateful to me? Is this because of Lloyd?
  ans:
  - No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you.

- que:
  - Mom, please?
  ans:
  - Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest. I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.

- que:
  - You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
  ans:
  - I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.

- que:
  - If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
  ans:
  - Alright.

- que:
  - You will?
  ans:
  - Okay. Oh, here's Ray. Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.

- que:
  - Hi. You called me?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Thank you very much.

- que:
  - Whoah, what a day, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. What a day.

- que:
  - Quick question - do you know who I am?
  ans:
  - Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
  ans:
  - No, I read it on the message.

- que:
  - Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out. Do you wanna go out?
  ans:
  - Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.

- que:
  - Busy?
  ans:
  - Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.

- que:
  - Are you busy on Friday?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I have to help my father.

- que:
  - Are you busy on Saturday?
  ans:
  - Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.

- que:
  - So you're monumentally busy?
  ans:
  - Well, not monumentally.

- que:
  - What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
  ans:
  - Hmmm....

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - I'll go.

- que:
  - You will? Excellent, alright, this is great. You will, really?
  ans:
  - Eight. Eight O' clock.

- que:
  - What are these?
  ans:
  - They're Bavarian Death style pretzels.

- que:
  - Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Keymaster?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.

- que:
  - So it's an honor?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So we can finally talk?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - He does this every year?
  ans:
  - It's the worst job since keymaster.

- que:
  - It's just you and your dad, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.

- que:
  - So what's your job this summer?
  ans:
  - Job? Being a great date.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I think you should wear that.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Mmmm.

- que:
  - After work?
  ans:
  - I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.

- que:
  - I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you?
  ans:
  - Me? Sure I do.

- que:
  - Wait, wait. You told her about me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Well... just meet her.

- que:
  - Be friends?
  ans:
  - Yeah. With potential.

- que:
  - Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around. Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - If you'll just maybe ease it into second.

- que:
  - Am I wrecking my car?
  ans:
  - Yeah, a little bit. Listen, this is important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.

- que:
  - Little more gas. Ease it up. Hold on- minor setback. Now you feel confident, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Now, go into second. Little more gas... Yeah! You can get this whole problem. Now, maybe you downshift to first?
  ans:
  - This is so noble.

- que:
  - Let's get outta here. You want to?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yes. Are you shaking?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then why are you shaking?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm happy.

- que:
  - It did?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. It was wonderful.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - It was wonderful.

- que:
  - How do you know what I'm going to say?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...

- que:
  - Say what?
  ans:
  - I think that we should spend some time apart.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Well, I need to study, and...

- que:
  - You need to study?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Okay, what did we just decide?
  ans:
  - We decided...

- que:
  - Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
  ans:
  - No, no.

- que:
  - Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
  ans:
  - I think that we should stop going out on dates.

- que:
  - Is this because of your dad?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
  ans:
  - She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.

- que:
  - Did you tell anybody?
  ans:
  - Just my dad.

- que:
  - You told your dad?
  ans:
  - You have Corey and DC. I have my dad.

- que:
  - Lloyd, I love you, okay?
  ans:
  - What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.

- que:
  - I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
  ans:
  - One more time would be nice.

- que:
  - Alright, high level air safety tips. If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
  ans:
  - Not right now, thanks.

- que:
  - Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
  ans:
  - No my brother, you have to go buy your own.

- que:
  - Hello. May I please speak with Diane please?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.

- que:
  - Is this the guy with the Mustang?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The guy with the Datsun?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The truck?
  ans:
  - Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.

- que:
  - She's really pretty great, isn't she?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she is. Good luck.

- que:
  - Yeah. Honey?
  ans:
  - Thanks Lloyd.

- que:
  - How do you pay for one of those?
  ans:
  - Well, we pay for the . That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.

- que:
  - Yeah Lloyd. What are your plans for the future?
  ans:
  - Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.

- que:
  - Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
  ans:
  - That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.

- que:
  - I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
  ans:
  - \"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel...\"

- que:
  - So what's up?
  ans:
  - Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes? They're going to be valuable some day.

- que:
  - Your car?
  ans:
  - Diane Court.

- que:
  - How ya doin' Miss Evans?
  ans:
  - You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way.

  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
  ans:
  - I'm Lloyd Dobler.

- que:
  - Alright. Key?
  ans:
  - Ooop, excuse me.

  ans:
  - I don't really know where we are.

- que:
  - You know Diane Court?
  ans:
  - Wow, man. Well. Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.

- que:
  - You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up. Why am I yelling?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.

- que:
  - 2 Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Sir, the list is correct.

- que:
  - A charade? How could it be a charade?
  ans:
  - Luck.

  - What?
  ans:
  - I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.

- que:
  - Should I stay?
  ans:
  - It's a beautiful city.

- que:
  - Should I stay?
  ans:
  - It's up to you.

- que:
  - Yeah, what's that?
  ans:
  - That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:

  - When?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Soon.

- que:
  - What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam?
  ans:
  - It's good business.

- que:
  - If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how?
  ans:
  - I just told you.

- que:
  - Where are the guards?
  ans:
  - The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.

- que:
  - So I'm responsible for the weather?
  ans:
  - I asked for metal, you gave me glass.

- que:
  - Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Nice things cost money.

  - I don't know, ten or twelve. That's a good color. Dark blues, grays.

- que:
  - How you feeling, all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's the matter, everything all right at home? Mila's okay?
  ans:
  - She's good.

  ans:
  - Things are great, things are great.

- que:
  - Pistols?
  ans:
  - Pistols, rifles, carbines ... I'd be grateful.

- que:
  - What others?
  ans:
  - He doesn't deserve your loyalty. More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.

- que:
  - Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
  ans:
  - I think most people right now have other priorities.

- que:
  - What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
  ans:
  - The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.

  ans:
  - There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

- que:
  - You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; I've never understood that. What's next?
  ans:
  - Christmas presents.

- que:
  - Are you losing money?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.

- que:
  - I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
  ans:
  - There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office.

- que:
  - They arrived, can you believe it?
  ans:
  - They're withholding payment.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.

  - No, no, what, what is it?
  ans:

  - What now?
  ans:
  - That doesn't work, sir.

- que:
  - You're sure about this two person thing?
  ans:
  - Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.

- que:
  - PHONE What is it?
  ans:
  - I heard a noise.

- que:
  - PHONE Where?
  ans:
  - PHONE Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...

  - Why aren't you there?
  ans:
  - I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.

- que:
  - Why do you always answer a question with a question?
  ans:
  - I'm inquisitive.

- que:
  - Hello? Ted?
  ans:
  - No, it's me.

- que:
  - WHAAAATT?
  ans:
  - Don't forget to set the alarm.

- que:
  - Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I live here.

- que:
  - I had to change. Did anyone call?
  ans:
  - Just some asshole trying to scare me.

- que:
  - Can we talk?
  ans:
  - I don't think that's a good idea.

- que:
  - What do you want from me, Cotton?
  ans:
  - You could start with an apology.

- que:
  - How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
  ans:
  - I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.

- que:
  - Did it?
  ans:
  - It helped me realize one thing.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.

- que:
  - Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
  ans:
  - You have a right to be angry.

- que:
  - Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
  ans:
  - Fair enough.

- que:
  - What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
  ans:
  - Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.

- que:
  - Hi, Gale, any leads?
  ans:
  - Tons and tons.

- que:
  - Where is Sidney's father?
  ans:
  - Home--where he lives.

- que:
  - Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - Youre all in this together?
  ans:
  - Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Finish what my son started.

- que:
  - How do you put up with this Greek shit?
  ans:
  - Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...

- que:
  - What's your subject?
  ans:
  - I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.

- que:
  - Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
  ans:
  - I think he's doing Dolly.

- que:
  - Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
  ans:
  - Not one bit.

- que:
  - Where's Sid?
  ans:
  - She dumped me.

- que:
  - You freakin?
  ans:
  - How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...

- que:
  - I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
  ans:
  - Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - The forbidden subject.

- que:
  - What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
  ans:
  - It's under control.

- que:
  - I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
  ans:
  - No, it's not.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Good question. You took the bait.

- que:
  - Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
  ans:
  - Youre not going to get away with this.

- que:
  - Where's Sid?
  ans:
  - Damned if I know. She ditched me.

- que:
  - What guy?
  ans:
  - Randy somebody.

- que:
  - Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
  ans:
  - Need some help, honey.

- que:
  - Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
  ans:
  - Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.

- que:
  - Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
  ans:
  - A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.

- que:
  - Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails?
  ans:
  - Tails.

- que:
  - So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
  ans:
  - Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.

- que:
  - Not good. How you doin?
  ans:
  - Not good.

- que:
  - He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
  ans:
  - Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.

- que:
  - Can we turn the light on?
  ans:
  - That's not the way it's done.

- que:
  - Ssshh! What was that?
  ans:
  - Let's find out.

- que:
  - Dewey?
  ans:
  - There's nothing. I'm coming down.

- que:
  - Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
  ans:
  - They thought it was a publicity stunt.

- que:
  - Oh my God. How could it happen?
  ans:
  - They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - I'll give you one guess.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - That's not the way we play the game.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - You're pretty when you're angry.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - I'm everywhere.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - It's what you want from me.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.

- que:
  - Sidney. Hello. How are you?
  ans:
  - I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...

- que:
  - It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
  ans:
  - It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh my God.

- que:
  - Where is your attacker?
  ans:
  - I dont know.

- que:
  - Is Sid in therapy?
  ans:
  - I got a surprise for you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - \"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...

- que:
  - Time to change numbers again?
  ans:
  - Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.

- que:
  - Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
  ans:
  - Please, I have the perfect excuse.

- que:
  - What about rehearsal?
  ans:
  - Gotta.

- que:
  - I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
  ans:
  - That was good.

- que:
  - Who is that guy?
  ans:
  - It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.

- que:
  - Can I come with her?
  ans:
  - No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.

- que:
  - How many guys they have on you?
  ans:
  - I counted four.

- que:
  - Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
  ans:
  - Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.

- que:
  - Her old boyfriend?
  ans:
  - No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.

- que:
  - I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
  ans:
  - You're not allowed to ask that.

- que:
  - Gale?
  ans:
  - She's not here right now.

- que:
  - What's your favorite scary movie?
  ans:
  - Closer than you think.

- que:
  - Do you want to die?
  ans:
  - I hate scary movies.

- que:
  - Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
  ans:
  - Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..

- que:
  - I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
  ans:
  - You ass.

- que:
  - Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
  ans:
  - I get scared really easy, okay.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - He's after me.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Don't panic.

- que:
  - Do you work for her now?
  ans:
  - Me, too. Randy. Me too.

- que:
  - I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
  ans:
  - I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.

- que:
  - Melinda McGraw?
  ans:
  - No, the other one. The one who played his wife.

- que:
  - Jesus. Hello?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Well what number are you trying to reach?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Do I?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

- que:
  - Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
  ans:
  - More of a game really.

- que:
  - What kind of a game?
  ans:
  - I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!

- que:
  - No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - Closer than you think.

- que:
  - Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
  ans:
  - To see your reaction.

- que:
  - Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
  ans:
  - Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

- que:
  - What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
  ans:
  - Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.

- que:
  - So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
  ans:
  - I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.

- que:
  - A note?
  ans:
  - That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

- que:
  - Alright Kincaid, no where to?
  ans:
  - I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

- que:
  - Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
  ans:
  - Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.

- que:
  - Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
  ans:
  - Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - You mean like, movie trilogies?
  ans:
  - You seem to like movies, Detective.

- que:
  - Did you request this case?
  ans:
  - No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business. I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Ghosts are tough, you can't shoot ghosts.

- que:
  - What did you know about your mother?
  ans:
  - Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.

- que:
  - How is that good news?
  ans:
  - Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer. And I know how to handle guys like that.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, how?
  ans:
  - Catch him, or kill him.

- que:
  - Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware of last night's Events?
  ans:
  - Yeah. A real tragedy.

- que:
  - Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
  ans:
  - Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.

- que:
  - Is that a threat, Detective?
  ans:
  - When it's a threat, you'll know it.

- que:
  - What Rielly?
  ans:
  - There's someone here who wants to help.

- que:
  - He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And what made you think it was Sidney?
  ans:
  - Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Follow me.

- que:
  - Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
  ans:
  - No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. These two lethal weapons.

- que:
  - They found another note?
  ans:
  - You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.

- que:
  - You used to say that was our strength.
  ans:
  - So it's off to London for a week? New York for a month? L.A Forever?

- que:
  - Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
  ans:
  - Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.

- que:
  - All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you?
  ans:
  - Off the record.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - The boys said no. She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.

- que:
  - Someone stole Sid's file?
  ans:
  - I've got my suspicions but still, nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.

- que:
  - And who is that?
  ans:
  - Jennifer needs me.

- que:
  - Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
  ans:
  - I'm on duty.

- que:
  - Has anyone else every used your phone?
  ans:
  - Just Jennifer. And you.

- que:
  - Nevermind, what'd you two find?
  ans:
  - Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.

- que:
  - What's your point?
  ans:
  - No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.

- que:
  - I remember her! She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
  ans:
  - But you know who she was.

- que:
  - Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's your favorite scary movie?
  ans:
  - Honestly, my life.

- que:
  - Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

- que:
  - Geez.
  ans:
  - Who's phone?

- que:
  - I am Gale Weathers!
  ans:
  - None.

- que:
  - There a story in that building?
  ans:
  - I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

- que:
  - Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
  ans:
  - Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus.

- que:
  - Oh come on! Why the hostility?
  ans:
  - They're the ones who approved it.

- que:
  - Just because you knew her?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
  ans:
  - Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.

- que:
  - Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Who's this.

- que:
  - All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
  ans:
  - What are you talking about?

- que:
  - Page 22, Candy's big moment.
  ans:
  - Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

- que:
  - Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Why don't we just read the scene? Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
  ans:
  - Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you have the wrong number.

- que:
  - But you know my favorite name?
  ans:
  - I'm hanging up right now.

- que:
  - Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
  ans:
  - It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.

- que:
  - What? What movie?
  ans:
  - My movie.

- que:
  - I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
  ans:
  - Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.

- que:
  - Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - W-what do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - The question isn't who I am. The question is, who's with me.

- que:
  - Don't do it! If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
  ans:
  - She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.

- que:
  - WHERE?
  ans:
  - I'll call you, when you're on your way.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.

- que:
  - Alright, I'm here. Now what?
  ans:
  - You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.

- que:
  - I thought you wanted me here?
  ans:
  - Alright I'm here, now show your face so we can finish this.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, your voice.
  ans:
  - Are you sure?

- que:
  - Sorry.
  ans:
  - Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?

- que:
  - How'd you do?
  ans:
  - Piece of cake. She'll be there.

- que:
  - So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
  ans:
  - Duh... that's quick.

- que:
  - I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
  ans:
  - Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.

- que:
  - You ready to party hard tonight?
  ans:
  - You know it.

- que:
  - Dude. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I was hoping Sid and I could talk.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
  ans:
  - Where the fuck did she go?

- que:
  - Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to see her, that's all.

- que:
  - You rode your bike out there?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.

- que:
  - You sleep in THAT?
  ans:
  - My dad's in the other room.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.

- que:
  - Oh it did?
  ans:
  - So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.

- que:
  - You know what my dad will do to you?
  ans:
  - I'm going... I'm going.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Oh Billy... Please... God...

- que:
  - See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
  ans:
  - I'm so sorry... please understand.

- que:
  - Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
  ans:
  - No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You heard me.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Yeah... I think so.

- que:
  - When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
  ans:
  - I called my dad.

- que:
  - You don't still think it was me?
  ans:
  - I thought you were...

- que:
  - Why did you kill my mother?
  ans:
  - I don't understand...

- que:
  - Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.

- que:
  - What number are you trying to reach?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Do I?
  ans:
  - It happens. Take it easy.

- que:
  - So why did you dial it again?
  ans:
  - To apologize.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I want to talk to you for a second.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

- que:
  - What's that noise?
  ans:
  - Popcorn.

- que:
  - You're making popcorn?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Really? What?
  ans:
  - Just some scary movie.

- que:
  - Do you like scary movies?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - What's your favorite scary movie?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
  ans:
  - Guess.

- que:
  - Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Freddy Krueger.

- que:
  - Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why do you want to know my name?
  ans:
  - Because I want to know who I'm looking at.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I want to now who I'm talking to.

- que:
  - What do you think I said?
  ans:
  - I have to go now.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I told you not to hang up on me.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - To talk.

- que:
  - You getting scared?
  ans:
  - No-bored.

- que:
  - Is this some kind of a joke?
  ans:
  - More of a game, really.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.

- que:
  - Or else what?
  ans:
  - My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...

- que:
  - How do you know his name?
  ans:
  - Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - Guess.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - Turn off the light.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - I can't think.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.

- que:
  - Productive. So they're closing down the school?
  ans:
  - Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.

- que:
  - And why is that? Has something happened?
  ans:
  - You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.

- que:
  - Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
  ans:
  - No, not yet.

- que:
  - He's not a suspect, is he?
  ans:
  - We haven't ruled out that possibil...

- que:
  - What brings you out to these parts?
  ans:
  - You never know when or where a story will break.

- que:
  - Then what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.

- que:
  - Mind if I join you?
  ans:
  - Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.

- que:
  - What kind of lead?
  ans:
  - A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.

- que:
  - I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
  ans:
  - Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.

- que:
  - Can I bring Kenny?
  ans:
  - NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.

- que:
  - So is Dewey your real name?
  ans:
  - Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.

- que:
  - We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
  ans:
  - I'll call for backup.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.

- que:
  - Does mom know?
  ans:
  - Yes, you doofus.

- que:
  - Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
  ans:
  - Hold up a sec...

- que:
  - What is she doing here?
  ans:
  - She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.

- que:
  - You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
  ans:
  - ...yeah...

- que:
  - You're sure it was the Hilton?
  ans:
  - At the airport.

- que:
  - He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I guess.

- que:
  - Any word on my Dad?
  ans:
  - Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...

- que:
  - And my Dad? Any word on him?
  ans:
  - God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.

- que:
  - Have they found my father?
  ans:
  - Afraid not.

- que:
  - Should I be worried?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - How is everything?
  ans:
  - We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.

- que:
  - What were you doing out here?
  ans:
  - Drive by patrol.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - She's tough.

- que:
  - They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
  ans:
  - Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.

- que:
  - She staying with you?
  ans:
  - We haven't located her Dad yet.

- que:
  - Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
  ans:
  - Keeping my eye on Sidney.

- que:
  - Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
  ans:
  - There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.

- que:
  - She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
  ans:
  - Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Call the police.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
  ans:
  - What? What?

- que:
  - You want to go live?
  ans:
  - No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.

- que:
  - What's the plan?
  ans:
  - Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.

- que:
  - What's the delay?
  ans:
  - About thirty seconds.

- que:
  - It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's right.

- que:
  - How's the book?
  ans:
  - It'll be out later this year.

- que:
  - Do you still think he's innocent?
  ans:
  - He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.

- que:
  - Have you talked to Cotton?
  ans:
  - Many times.

- que:
  - Has his story changed?
  ans:
  - Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.

- que:
  - Why would she lie about it?
  ans:
  - For attention. The girl has some serious issues.

- que:
  - And why would she do that?
  ans:
  - Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.

- que:
  - Where do you get this shit?
  ans:
  - Ricki Lake.

- que:
  - Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
  ans:
  - I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

- que:
  - What's your favorite scary movie?
  ans:
  - Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.

- que:
  - Are you alone in the house?
  ans:
  - That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.

- que:
  - So where are you?
  ans:
  - Your front porch.

- que:
  - Why would you call me from my front porch?
  ans:
  - That's the original part.

- que:
  - So where are you?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - Can you see me right now?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - What am I doing?
  ans:
  - Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hello Sidney.

- que:
  - Can you knock?
  ans:
  - I heard screaming.

- que:
  - Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
  ans:
  - Working, thank you.

- que:
  - THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
  ans:
  - She's the Scream Queen.

- que:
  - What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
  ans:
  - It would certainly improve your high school Q.

- que:
  - You coming tonight?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.

- que:
  - If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
  ans:
  - It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.

- que:
  - The why'd the police let him go?
  ans:
  - Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.

- que:
  - So what's his reason?
  ans:
  - Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

- que:
  - I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
  ans:
  - Which is you...

- que:
  - And what would be your motive?
  ans:
  - It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.

- que:
  - What's Leatherface doing here?
  ans:
  - He came to make up.

- que:
  - I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why are they doing this?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - It's all part of the game.

- que:
  - So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
  ans:
  - Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.

- que:
  - Do they know who did it?
  ans:
  - Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...

- que:
  - They think it's school-related?
  ans:
  - Or a man's mentality.

- que:
  - How do you gut someone?
  ans:
  - You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.

- que:
  - Just like old times, ain't it?
  ans:
  - No, nothing's like it used to be.

- que:
  - Do you really think Billy did it?
  ans:
  - He was there, Tatum.

- que:
  - Shit, what is he doing here?
  ans:
  - I bet he's pissed.

- que:
  - This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
  ans:
  - You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.

- que:
  - And you believe it?
  ans:
  - Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.

- que:
  - Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
  ans:
  - Oh, god...

- que:
  - Is Billy going to be there tonight?
  ans:
  - He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.

- que:
  - What do you think about when you're having sex?
  ans:
  - With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.

- que:
  - How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
  ans:
  - Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.

- que:
  - Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
  ans:
  - I don't know, they just did.

- que:
  - Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
  ans:
  - For once, Stu, drop it.

- que:
  - Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
  ans:
  - I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that. And nobody's going to swap with you.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - There's nothing that says I have to work with him. If Somerset wants out, \"goodbye.\" Give it to me.

- que:
  - How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
  ans:
  - Ease back, Mills.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I'm in.

- que:
  - Announcing what?
  ans:
  - There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...

- que:
  - Have you heard?
  ans:
  - No, I haven't heard.

- que:
  - Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?
  ans:
  - I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You know.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.

- que:
  - How you feeling?
  ans:
  - I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.

- que:
  - Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
  ans:
  - She was... she was on the bed. She was just sitting on the bed.

- que:
  - Who tied her down? You or him?
  ans:
  - I'm... I'm just delivering a package.

- que:
  - I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.

- que:
  - What's so exciting?
  ans:
  - It's not too far away now.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You'll see.

- que:
  - What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
  ans:
  - Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional. This is, though. What I'm doing.

- que:
  - Murderers?
  ans:
  - A woman...

- que:
  - Murderers like you?
  ans:
  - Delusions of grandeur.

- que:
  - And, why is that?
  ans:
  - You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me. And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.

- que:
  - What the fuck is going on?
  ans:
  - I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.

- que:
  - I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
  ans:
  - I... I don't follow.

- que:
  - I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
  ans:
  - Drop it.

- que:
  - Who said this was murder?
  ans:
  - No one yet.

- que:
  - Please be quiet for a while, would you?
  ans:
  - There's a bucket here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There's a bucket. Under the table.

- que:
  - You think it was poison?
  ans:
  - Guessing at this point is useless.

- que:
  - You've seen my files, right? Seen the things I've done?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is that clear?
  ans:
  - Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...

- que:
  - Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink? Near the food?
  ans:
  - This doesn't make any sense.

- que:
  - Can we talk about this in private?
  ans:
  - It's a package deal. You get the phone with the office.

- que:
  - Detective Mills here. Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back... What? Why?
  ans:
  - It's my wife.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Tonight.

- que:
  - The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
  ans:
  - What about sports?

- que:
  - Did you read them?
  ans:
  - Seven Terraces of Purgation.

- que:
  - Forced what?
  ans:
  - Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.

- que:
  - No fingerprints?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - No witnesses of any kind?
  ans:
  - None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.

- que:
  - You're sure your men didn't move this?
  ans:
  - Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.

- que:
  - What the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - A switchblade.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And you don't?
  ans:
  - I wish I still thought like you.

- que:
  - Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
  ans:
  - You tell me. I'm new in town.

- que:
  - Satisfy our curiosity?
  ans:
  - Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once. fired it once.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - It was my first one of these. We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in. I was still considered a rookie.

- que:
  - How was it?
  ans:
  - I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.

- que:
  - How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
  ans:
  - Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.

- que:
  - How much money do you have?
  ans:
  - I don't know... like fifty.

- que:
  - Him?
  ans:
  - For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.

- que:
  - What? Assessing fines?
  ans:
  - You got to be kidding.

- que:
  - How is this legal?
  ans:
  - Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.

- que:
  - How do you know all about this?
  ans:
  - I don't. Neither do you.

- que:
  - Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage?
  ans:
  - It's not what you think it is.

- que:
  - You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
  ans:
  - That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.

- que:
  - What are you going to say?
  ans:
  - You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Wait... just wait.

- que:
  - No point in arguing anymore...
  ans:
  - What the fuck is wrong with you?

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - We had him.

- que:
  - How can you say that? Especially after today?
  ans:
  - Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind. There's no winning and losing here.

- que:
  - Where's the victory?
  ans:
  - You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.

- que:
  - What the fuck is wrong with you? What burnt you out?
  ans:
  - Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right? No one's worthy of you.

- que:
  - Oh, you want to stay now?
  ans:
  - One of two things will happen. We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.

- que:
  - You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
  ans:
  - I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me the favor.

- que:
  - When do we get to question him?
  ans:
  - You know he's fucking us.

- que:
  - Well... what the fuck, man?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Tell me it's not true.

- que:
  - I don't know why... why now?
  ans:
  - Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.

- que:
  - Are you absolutely certain?
  ans:
  - I can't do this now... please.

- que:
  - Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
  ans:
  - It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table.

- que:
  - Too long. What do you think so far?
  ans:
  - I don't know, with this case.

- que:
  - Did the wife confess?
  ans:
  - When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.

- que:
  - Did their son see it happen?

  ans:
  - You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...

- que:
  - Why else?
  ans:
  - Come on, say it. You know...

- que:
  - Me and the muse, of course. How is your book coming along?
  ans:
  - Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences. You know how it is with women.

- que:
  - What kind of a horrible thing is that?
  ans:
  - I'll do it myself.

- que:
  - My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly?
  ans:
  - Hey, flower child, the sixties are over. And this stuff is hazardous to your health.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.

  ans:
  - Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - Someone from the village.

- que:
  - Now, what did I do to deserve this?
  ans:
  - Come on, at least try one. It took me two hours to make these.

- que:
  - So, did you sleep good?
  ans:
  - Yeah... I have to go to town.

- que:
  - Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
  ans:

- que:
  - Where have you been?
  ans:
  - The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - I haven't the slightest idea.

- que:
  - Maybe an animal.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Let me guess, Another short circuit?
  ans:
  - Hi, darling.

- que:
  - During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner. What's your point?
  ans:
  - Damn it, look at you! Don't you see what's happening with you? We need to get out of here, don't you understand? Out of this house!

- que:
  - We loved each other once. Have you forgotten that?
  ans:

- que:
  - How did you get me out of there?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't have made it by myself.

- que:
  - You don't remember?
  ans:
  - Ellen.

- que:
  - But what is the truth?
  ans:
  - I don't know all about what happened back then. But it always stood between me and my husband.

- que:
  - Does this dog here belong to you?
  ans:
  - No, I've never seen him before.

- que:
  - Do I look like it that much?
  ans:

  - Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?

- que:
  - It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
  ans:
  - A different one you haven't written?

- que:
  - Not ready? Where is she?
  ans:
  - Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.

- que:
  - But at the playhouse. Nurse?
  ans:
  - Be still.

- que:
  - Like Valentine and Silvia?
  ans:
  - He looks well enough for a mountebank.

- que:
  - They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
  ans:
  - What do you love so much?

- que:
  - And--?
  ans:
  - And I love poetry above all.

- que:
  - Above Lord Wessex?
  ans:
  - As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.

- que:
  - Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
  ans:
  - Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.

- que:
  - Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
  ans:
  - I am, Master Shakespeare.

- que:
  - But your voice Have they dropped?
  ans:
  - It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.

- que:
  - Is she obedient?
  ans:
  - As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.

- que:
  - You have opened the playhouses?
  ans:
  - I have, Master Shakespeare.

- que:
  - Who are you, master?
  ans:
  - I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.

- que:
  - You admire it?
  ans:
  - I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.

- que:
  - Oh. What is your name?
  ans:
  - Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

- que:
  - Answer me only this, are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - You would not leave me?
  ans:
  - I must. Look-- how pale the window.

- que:
  - I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
  ans:
  - Mr. Henslowe?

- que:
  - Oh, but it will end well for love?
  ans:
  - You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.

- que:
  - Will! What--?
  ans:
  - A literary feud. Quite normal.

- que:
  - The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
  ans:
  - Will you read it for me?

- que:
  - An excellent beginning Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
  ans:
  - Sold in marriage and half way to America.

- que:
  - No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
  ans:
  - How does it?

- que:
  - Do you intend to marry, my lord?
  ans:
  - I do not love you, my lord.

- que:
  - But why me?
  ans:
  - It was your eyes. No, your lips.

- que:
  - The Queen has consented?
  ans:
  - She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.

- que:
  - Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
  ans:
  - Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.

- que:
  - Your name?
  ans:
  - THOMAS Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

- que:
  - Where did you learn how to do that?
  ans:
  - THOMAS I ...

- que:
  - THOMAS Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
  ans:
  - Let me see you. Take off your hat.

- que:
  - Do you understand me?
  ans:
  - THOMAS No, sir.

- que:
  - He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
  ans:
  - THOMAS If you love her, you must do what she asks.

- que:
  - And break her heart and mine?
  ans:
  - THOMAS I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.

- que:
  - Your aunt?
  ans:
  - THOMAS Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.

- que:
  - THOMAS And her voice? Like lark song?
  ans:
  - Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.

- que:
  - I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
  ans:
  - THOMAS She sings too?

- que:
  - By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
  ans:
  - All right, just a few questions.

- que:
  - With which of the following figures do you most closely identify, Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
  ans:
  - Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Chess. Chess is often used as well.

- que:
  - You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
  ans:
  - Discussion group, Alex, discussion.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About this guy, this Hugo person.

- que:
  - I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
  ans:
  - Have you seen him?

- que:
  - Can I show you something?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Juliet?
  ans:
  - You mean immoral.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - He's still here.

- que:
  - When are you going to let the police know?
  ans:
  - You call them if you want.

- que:
  - And what about you?
  ans:
  - Now what else? DAVID I don't know.

- que:
  - So who's going to do it?
  ans:
  - Dig the pit, I don't know.

- que:
  - Then what? Who's going to do what?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm talking about.

- que:
  - Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You know what. Who's going to do it.

- que:
  - We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
  ans:
  - I can't do it.

- que:
  - Is that going to be deep enough?
  ans:
  - Don't you worry about that.

- que:
  - Is this necessary?
  ans:
  - Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.

- que:
  - Can we talk about something?
  ans:
  - Not now. I have an idea.

- que:
  - What's the problem?
  ans:
  - I want to talk now.

- que:
  - Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
  ans:
  - Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?

- que:
  - How much did you pay?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How much did you pay?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Security.

- que:
  - From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
  ans:
  - There was a break-in.

- que:
  - What's all this for, more security?
  ans:
  - I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Not eating what?
  ans:
  - Not eating like you used to, that's what.

  - Looking for you? Yes.

- que:
  - What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
  ans:
  - We just wanted to speak to you.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Your friends.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - But they know.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.

- que:
  - I don't know.
  ans:
  - Cover it?

- que:
  - Is this being recorded?
  ans:
  - This is just an informal discussion.

- que:
  - What does it look like?
  ans:
  - It looks like he's writing everything down.

- que:
  - Well, then?
  ans:
  - I've never seen any of these men before.

- que:
  - And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
  ans:
  - Yes, I suppose so.

- que:
  - Parked outside?
  ans:
  - No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.

- que:
  - That's all?
  ans:
  - Sorry to waste your time.

- que:
  - Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
  ans:
  - Yes, thanks.

- que:
  - Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you like it?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, it's great.

- que:
  - Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing. We thought you were someone else.

- que:
  - Cameron?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And when did anyone last say to you these exact words, You are the sunshine of my life'?
  ans:
  - Did you know --

- que:
  - -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
  ans:
  - Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.

- que:
  - Who was it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.

- que:
  - A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
  ans:
  - So we'll meet him, then?

- que:
  - Know and love?

  - David?
  ans:
  - Hugo.

- que:
  - What sort of car?
  ans:
  - Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Open it.

- que:
  - You want me to kick it open?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Alex.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm just looking.

- que:
  - Don't look?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
  ans:
  - Unfeasible.

- que:
  - Who's going to do it?
  ans:
  - I thought we all were.

- que:
  - David?
  ans:
  - Be careful.

- que:
  - Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
  ans:
  - Stop nagging.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Cameron. You remember Cameron.

- que:
  - What's he doing here?
  ans:
  - That's not him.

- que:
  - Who was it?
  ans:
  - Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is this the same stuff you made last week?
  ans:
  - No, no, it's different.

- que:
  - Don't you?
  ans:
  - I don't see the point in that.

- que:
  - No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
  ans:
  - Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - We have to talk.

- que:
  - Your painful groin?
  ans:
  - Later. But first -- him.

- que:
  - He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
  ans:
  - David?

- que:
  - And the money?
  ans:
  - We could put it somewhere.

- que:
  - Where he can't get it?
  ans:
  - Now you thought of that, not me.

- que:
  - Expecting anyone?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Aren't you going to answer it?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

- que:
  - You'll wait in the hall?
  ans:
  - I'll wait there.

- que:
  - And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
  ans:
  - Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.

- que:
  - Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
  ans:
  - Are you all right?

- que:
  - Don't you ever stop?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You were going to say something.

- que:
  - What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
  ans:
  - It's OK. There's no problem.

- que:
  - Can you afford this place?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What about?

  ans:
  - No, not that I recall, I was asleep.

  ans:
  - No, nothing, sorry.

- que:
  - Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
  ans:
  - There are only two other people in the flat.

- que:
  - Who said there were four?
  ans:
  - We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.

- que:
  - How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
  ans:
  - Yes, absolutely.

- que:
  - I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
  ans:
  - No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.

- que:
  - Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.

- que:
  - Is this where no one stays?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's right, that's it.

- que:
  - Do you smoke?
  ans:
  - Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.

- que:
  - Did you ever kill a man?
  ans:
  - Just get on with it, Alex.

- que:
  - Is this what they always look like?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.

- que:
  - Would you like to talk about it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you know many of these people?
  ans:
  - Yes. They're my friends.

- que:
  - Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Two hundred pounds?
  ans:
  - Two hundred pounds.

- que:
  - You paid two hundred pounds for this?
  ans:
  - That's what it cost, David.

- que:
  - Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
  ans:
  - No one. I promise.

- que:
  - Who have you talked to?
  ans:
  - No one.

- que:
  - With a face like this?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - You and me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.

- que:
  - Sorry?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - Right here?
  ans:
  - Not any real sneering as such, no.

- que:
  - And that's why I think you fit in here.
  ans:
  - There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?

- que:
  - I'm boring?
  ans:
  - You get the job done.

- que:
  - What guy?
  ans:
  - That guy, the one that died.

- que:
  - What guy that died?
  ans:
  - That one, last week.

- que:
  - Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
  ans:
  - Oh, him. Well, he died.

- que:
  - Would you like to come in?
  ans:
  - I'd be delighted.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.

- que:
  - What's it about?
  ans:
  - A priest who dies.

- que:
  - Do you think you could answer that?
  ans:
  - The telephone? It continues to ring.

- que:
  - A little bit. Is that good or bad?
  ans:
  - It's an improvement.

- que:
  - Shall I answer it?
  ans:
  - No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.

- que:
  - Working nights?
  ans:
  - I'm a doctor.

- que:
  - And he's a patient of yours?
  ans:
  - No. But he needs treatment.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - A certain weakness.

- que:
  - And that's not the same thing?
  ans:
  - No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.

- que:
  - Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
  ans:
  - Take all the time you like, doctor.

- que:
  - Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
  ans:
  - Same as everyone else.

- que:
  - But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And what do you recognize, names or faces?
  ans:
  - Diseases.

- que:
  - Sorry?
  ans:
  - And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.

- que:
  - One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
  ans:
  - Your watch.

- que:
  - Or a fake?
  ans:
  - You're in a good mood today, George.

- que:
  - Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
  ans:
  - It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...

- que:
  - Look, would you argue with your doctor?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Don't you like her?
  ans:
  - No, it's a very groovy girl.

- que:
  - Then what's the problem?
  ans:
  - She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - That kid... the hairdresser.

- que:
  - Maybe... why do you ask?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.

- que:
  - You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
  ans:
  - Yes, but... I thought...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That you were just indulging me.

- que:
  - That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
  ans:
  - It's just -- fabulous. Think you could do anything for me?

- que:
  - -- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
  ans:
  - What do you expect me to do about it?

- que:
  - Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - We cannot go into this later.

- que:
  - -- is that right?
  ans:
  - -- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.

- que:
  - -- is that what this is all about?
  ans:
  - -- is that what this is all about?

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - -- think what you have time to think, Lester.

- que:
  - Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What're you looking for?
  ans:
  - My keys.

- que:
  - You mean that girl, don't you?
  ans:
  - Thanks a lot.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.

- que:
  - Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think so.

- que:
  - That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - She did?
  ans:
  - It turned out to be cancer.

- que:
  - -- What?
  ans:
  - Nummers.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not used to that kind of treatment.

- que:
  - What kind of treatment?
  ans:
  - I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.

- que:
  - What're you doing later?
  ans:
  - Whatever you say.

- que:
  - We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.

- que:
  - Your husband?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.

- que:
  - Is she all right?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Just a minute...

- que:
  - She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't say so if I didn't.

- que:
  - Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
  ans:
  - Well she...

- que:
  - She what?
  ans:
  - She's a friend of Jill's.

- que:
  - And who's Jill?
  ans:
  - Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.

- que:
  - Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
  ans:
  - Oh, no.

- que:
  - You going to answer it?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:
  - Want me to?
  ans:
  - Let it ring.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.

- que:
  - Well, is she your girlfriend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - It isn't?
  ans:
  - No. You know too many sick ladies.

- que:
  - You here to see my mother?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Hungry?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - You're my mother's hairdresser?
  ans:
  - I do her hair, yeah.

- que:
  - Chopped liver?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Did you hear me?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well, are you? Are you queer?
  ans:
  - ... yeah.

- que:
  - C'mon, are you or aren't you?
  ans:
  - Gee, this is great.

- que:
  - Why do you wanna know so bad?
  ans:
  - See if you've been making it with my mother.

- que:
  - Have you ever made it with a girl?
  ans:
  - I asked you first.

- que:
  - Making it with my mother?
  ans:
  - I'd like to do your hair sometime.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - ... just, you could look very heavy...

- que:
  - You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it is.

- que:
  - You think that's funny, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then what do you think?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - So you want to go in business for yourself?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - And you need money?
  ans:
  - Right, that's right.

- que:
  - They are?
  ans:
  - After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.

- que:
  - What sort of references do you have?
  ans:
  - Well, I do Barbara Rush.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.

- que:
  - You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
  ans:
  - George!

- que:
  - Buffums?
  ans:
  - Yes, Buffums.

- que:
  - Great. Who's been doing your hair?
  ans:
  - Jesus...

- que:
  - -- Yeah... your car down here?
  ans:
  - -- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.

- que:
  - -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Probably not.

- que:
  - How long you had this?
  ans:
  - Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.

- que:
  - Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
  ans:
  - -- Well no. It never came up.

- que:
  - You going to tell him?
  ans:
  - -- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.

- que:
  - Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink?
  ans:
  - No, thanks.

- que:
  - Where do you want to do this?
  ans:
  - Probably the bathroom.

- que:
  - Well, what do you think?
  ans:
  - I'd cut it...

- que:
  - You would?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think so...

- que:
  - Okay... but I want you to know one thing. I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - It's hot in here.

- que:
  - Do you? You still see him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - ... he tried to... uh... make it with me.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - It was after you, baby. After you.

- que:
  - Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
  ans:
  - No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.

- que:
  - Did Lester know about him?
  ans:
  - There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.

- que:
  - Did I what?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm talking about.

- que:
  - You did, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Baby...

- que:
  - You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
  ans:
  - George...

- que:
  - Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
  ans:
  - -- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...

- que:
  - -- what guy?
  ans:
  - -- this guy with Jill.

- que:
  - We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
  ans:
  - What about it?

- que:
  - You don't do that anymore, do you?
  ans:
  - Don't do it.

- que:
  - -- what?
  ans:
  - I don't know what gets into me.

- que:
  - You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
  ans:
  - That sounds like me.

- que:
  - He still having parties?
  ans:
  - He never stopped.

- que:
  - The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - -- yeah.

- que:
  - Am I entertaining you?
  ans:
  - We're friends.

- que:
  - -- what?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
  ans:
  - Not me, pal.

- que:
  - -- do you want ice?
  ans:
  - -- we're kidding ourselves.

- que:
  - -- we are?
  ans:
  - -- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.

- que:
  - I've got to leave?
  ans:
  - -- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Lester's on his way.

- que:
  - So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
  ans:
  - Where are you going?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - God, there's Lester...

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- I've got to.

- que:
  - Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
  ans:
  - No, man.
