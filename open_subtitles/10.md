  ans:

  ans:
  - It's fine. I can just get you at your office.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just have you for one second, please.

- que:
  - Did you do it?
  ans:
  - No.

  - Are you ready?
  ans:
  - Bye, Barry.

- que:
  - So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
  ans:
  - Ok.

- que:
  - Ok. What should I do about Eric?
  ans:
  - Just tell him to call me.

- que:
  - So...did my brother call you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Should I call you later?
  ans:
  - I'll just see you when you get back here.

- que:
  - MAUPAS I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
  ans:
  - Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.

- que:
  - You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Once or twice.

- que:
  - I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
  ans:
  - Then what's he doing here?

- que:
  - Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
  ans:
  - The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.

- que:
  - Has he hurt you?
  ans:
  - His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.

- que:
  - But why must you indulge in his pornography?
  ans:
  - I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.

- que:
  - Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
  ans:
  - Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.

- que:
  - I've you to look after me, haven't I?
  ans:
  - Don't turn us out, Abbe.

- que:
  - By whom? The Marquis?
  ans:
  - Mother's not half so blind as you.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.

- que:
  - I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
  ans:
  - What? What've I done?

- que:
  - Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
  ans:
  - You'd deny a dying man his salvation?

- que:
  - In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
  ans:
  - I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?

- que:
  - I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
  ans:
  - Enough to discern its tenor.

- que:
  - I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
  ans:
  - And --?

- que:
  - But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
  ans:
  - It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.

- que:
  - But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
  ans:
  - More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.

- que:
  - You among them?
  ans:
  - You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.

- que:
  - You mean to take us all down with you?
  ans:
  - Don't be absurd; it's only a play.

- que:
  - How can one man possibly be so selfish?
  ans:
  - His rug.

- que:
  - WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
  ans:
  - Because your writing continues, unchecked.

- que:
  - What on earth would that require?
  ans:
  - A night spent with the partner of my choice.

- que:
  - You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
  ans:
  - I wasn't talking about Madeleine.

- que:
  - An innocent child is dead.
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?

- que:
  - So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
  ans:
  - IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.

- que:
  - I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
  ans:
  - It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.

- que:
  - Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
  ans:
  - His wife's influence.

- que:
  - His wife's?
  ans:
  - Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.

- que:
  - And he's never once attempted escape?
  ans:
  - Oh. That.

- que:
  - Well...?
  ans:
  - It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.

- que:
  - Do you favor its publication?
  ans:
  - I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.

- que:
  - Shut down?
  ans:
  - You're a sentimental man.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.

- que:
  - And --?
  ans:
  - It was fiction, of course.

- que:
  - What could cause a tincture like this?
  ans:
  - He'll do no such thing.

- que:
  - You'd suffer in her stead?
  ans:
  - As you say, Doctor.

- que:
  - He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
  ans:
  - Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...

- que:
  - How is the patient faring?
  ans:
  - Poorly.

- que:
  - Will you sleep soundly tonight?
  ans:
  - No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.

- que:
  - Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.

- que:
  - Do you know how I define \"idealism,\" Monsieur Delben?
  ans:
  - I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben; I look to the future.

- que:
  - Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
  ans:
  - Sweet, then? Like the pastry?

- que:
  - It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I'm hungry for a proper visit.

- que:
  - Did I frighten you?
  ans:
  - It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.

- que:
  - Is it awfully violent?
  ans:
  - Most assuredly.

- que:
  - Is it terribly erotic?
  ans:
  - Fiendishly so.

- que:
  - Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
  ans:
  - The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...

- que:
  - What have they done to you now?
  ans:
  - They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.

- que:
  - How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
  ans:
  - You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.

- que:
  - You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
  ans:
  - No. But tell him I would.

- que:
  - With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
  ans:
  - I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.

- que:
  - But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
  ans:
  - It's tainted money, Doctor.

- que:
  - What thought is that?
  ans:
  - That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.

- que:
  - Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
  ans:
  - ....shame on you, truly...

- que:
  - How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
  ans:
  - I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.

- que:
  - They've put you up to this, haven't they?
  ans:
  - You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.

- que:
  - Do as I say.
  ans:
  - It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?

- que:
  - Doesn't that please you?
  ans:
  - Very much.

- que:
  - You're just scared.
  ans:
  - You prefer a book to your husband's company?

- que:
  - With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
  ans:
  - Am I?

- que:
  - But I am That's the killer, honey.
  ans:
  - It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?

- que:
  - And director.
  ans:
  - Who are you, sir?

- que:
  - I see. And you are in California for what reason?
  ans:
  - To make pictures.

- que:
  - Over at RKO?
  ans:
  - Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.

- que:
  - You know that can't happen.
  ans:
  - Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?

- que:
  - Why is that, Louis?
  ans:
  - Bel Air is restricted.

- que:
  - The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
  ans:
  - See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?

- que:
  - We're 125 million dollars in debt?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
  ans:
  - It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - The drinking.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Sir, I-

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.

- que:
  - Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
  ans:
  - Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?

- que:
  - Oh for God's sake, Louella-
  ans:
  - He personally asked you to?

- que:
  - Can I talk to Hearst?
  ans:
  - The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.

- que:
  - Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
  ans:
  - So, who is he? We have to know him.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.

- que:
  - Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
  ans:
  - Why her?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.

- que:
  - I don't care.
  ans:
  - The title?

- que:
  - Hedy Lamarr?
  ans:
  - Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.

- que:
  - Is that from one of the Gospels?
  ans:
  - Kinda.

- que:
  - George...
  ans:
  - YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?

- que:
  - What have I done?
  ans:
  - Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.

- que:
  - Yeah, ain't it swell?
  ans:
  - They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.

- que:
  - Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - To do what?
  ans:
  - That's for me to decide.

- que:
  - Pardon?
  ans:
  - CITIZEN KANE There's your title.

- que:
  - And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
  ans:
  - The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.

- que:
  - Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
  ans:
  - You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.

- que:
  - Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
  ans:
  - It was fun, wasn't it?

- que:
  - We done?
  ans:
  - We're from...

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.

- que:
  - How can he embarrass you?
  ans:
  - I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.

- que:
  - What who's been sayin'?
  ans:
  - You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here... 'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.

  ans:
  - What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.

  ans:
  - None of your fuckin' business.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing...

- que:
  - Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.

- que:
  - You know?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Do me a favor.

- que:
  - Sure. What is it?
  ans:
  - Hit me in the face.

- que:
  - You want me to do what?
  ans:
  - You heard me, I said hit me.

- que:
  - What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
  ans:
  - See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.

- que:
  - Go 'head.
  ans:
  - Who's that?

- que:
  - How do you know? You know her that good?
  ans:
  - No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.

- que:
  - She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
  ans:
  - Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.

- que:
  - Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
  ans:
  - Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.

- que:
  - Do you see her yet?
  ans:
  - Give me a chance. Let me look.

- que:
  - You want us to wait for you?
  ans:
  - No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.

- que:
  - You want the title shot?
  ans:
  - Say what you're gonna say.

- que:
  - You want the title shot or not?
  ans:
  - Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.

- que:
  - Whatcha doin'?
  ans:
  - I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.

- que:
  - I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
  ans:
  - Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.

- que:
  - What did Tommy say?
  ans:
  - I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...

- que:
  - What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
  ans:
  - Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - You know, when you gave him a beatin'.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me about it?
  ans:
  - It didn't have nothin' to do with you.

- que:
  - Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
  ans:
  - No, I just told you what happened.

- que:
  - Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
  ans:
  - Well, I heard some things.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...

- que:
  - What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
  ans:
  - When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.

- que:
  - Stop it. What're you, crazy?
  ans:
  - I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.

- que:
  - Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
  ans:
  - Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.

- que:
  - You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
  ans:
  - I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray hits me here. I can't tell the difference. I just fight.

- que:
  - Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
  ans:
  - It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Nine o'clock.

- que:
  - At night?
  ans:
  - Yeah. At night.

- que:
  - How many pounds I gotta lose?
  ans:
  - Three more, I figure.

- que:
  - Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to say hello.

- que:
  - Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
  ans:
  - You don't talk very much.

- que:
  - That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
  ans:
  - It feels real good.

- que:
  - Should I hit it?
  ans:
  - Just give it a nice little tap.

- que:
  - Can you see it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Jake, this is your father's bedroom.

- que:
  - Are you sure we should be doing this?
  ans:
  - Come over here.

- que:
  - Who asked you?
  ans:
  - But, Jake, I was just...

- que:
  - Who asked you?
  ans:
  - I was just...

- que:
  - What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.

- que:
  - Don't tell me \"No.\" I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
  ans:
  - I'm not interested in him.

- que:
  - You're not interested in him?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not.

- que:
  - In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
  ans:
  - Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.

- que:
  - You asleep?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What did I say?
  ans:
  - That he's got a pretty face.

- que:
  - You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
  ans:
  - Positive.

- que:
  - What did I do?
  ans:
  - You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - I went out.

- que:
  - Where you been all day?
  ans:
  - I took the kids to my sister's.

- que:
  - What'd you see?
  ans:
  - I went to the movies.

- que:
  - Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
  ans:
  - I am answering...

- que:
  - With Salvy, eh?
  ans:
  - I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there. Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong.

- que:
  - Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy? Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt! Who've you been fuckin'?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I sucked his cock.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.

- que:
  - Why don't you just call him up?
  ans:
  - No, not that.

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why don't you just call him?
  ans:
  - I dunno.

- que:
  - Sure, what else is new?
  ans:
  - No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.

- que:
  - Are you drunk?
  ans:
  - No. Open the door.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.

- que:
  - Hi, Tommy. How are you?
  ans:
  - Never felt better.

- que:
  - Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
  ans:
  - He should.

- que:
  - How's the weight? Ok?
  ans:
  - Yeah, the weight's Ok.

- que:
  - He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
  ans:
  - Hey, leave the kids alone.

- que:
  - Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
  ans:
  - Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.

- que:
  - Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
  ans:
  - I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.

- que:
  - What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
  ans:
  - No, you're his wife.

- que:
  - I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
  ans:
  - It don't look right.

- que:
  - This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
  ans:
  - This is the baby sitter.

- que:
  - Oh. When are they expected home?
  ans:
  - I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.

- que:
  - Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
  ans:
  - He has it. Thank you.

- que:
  - Jefferies?
  ans:
  - Name me a better photographer.

- que:
  - Like disposing of their wives?
  ans:
  - Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.

- que:
  - Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
  ans:
  - I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.

- que:
  - You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
  ans:
  - I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.

- que:
  - You think I made all this up?
  ans:
  - I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.

- que:
  - For instance?
  ans:
  - His wife took a trip.

- que:
  - By the way what happened to your leg?
  ans:
  - -- until yesterday morning.

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - Six ayem.

- que:
  - Feel a little foolish?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, \"Grand Central Or Bust!\"?
  ans:
  - The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.

- que:
  - Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
  ans:
  - If possible -- both.

- que:
  - A detective's nightmare.
  ans:
  - What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?

- que:
  - Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Thorwald.

- que:
  - You think he's getting out of here?
  ans:
  - Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.

- que:
  - Jewelry?
  ans:
  - He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.

- que:
  - Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
  ans:
  - You sure it belongs to his wife?

- que:
  - Your Lisa?
  ans:
  - My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.

- que:
  - Where'd they take Lisa?
  ans:
  - Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For getting rid of that cast.

- que:
  - Who said I was getting rid of it?
  ans:
  - This is Wednesday.

- que:
  - Wrong day?
  ans:
  - Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.

- que:
  - Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
  ans:
  - You did.

- que:
  - Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
  ans:
  - With that cast on -- you don't.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.

- que:
  - Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
  ans:
  - It's me.

- que:
  - Hello.
  ans:
  - Something wrong?

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.

- que:
  - Why should I?
  ans:
  - For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.

- que:
  - Can you get me that ring back?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.

- que:
  - It crashed, didn't it?
  ans:
  - Right now I'd even welcome trouble.

- que:
  - Gives your circulation something to fight. What kind of trouble?
  ans:
  - Lisa Fremont.

- que:
  - Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause. What is it? You have a fight?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
  ans:
  - Her father loading up the shotgun?

- que:
  - Is what you want something you can discuss?
  ans:
  - It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.

- que:
  - You're never going to marry?
  ans:
  - The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.

- que:
  - She pay you much?
  ans:
  - The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.

- que:
  - What'll you do if one of them catches you?
  ans:
  - Depends one which one.

- que:
  - Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
  ans:
  - Well, the salesman could be available soon.

- que:
  - He and his wife splitting up?
  ans:
  - It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.

- que:
  - Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
  ans:
  - Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.

- que:
  - What about this morning? Any developments?
  ans:
  - No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.

- que:
  - You called the police?
  ans:
  - Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend. An old, ornery friend.

- que:
  - Mrs. Thorwald?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.

- que:
  - You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
  ans:
  - And digging in. Look at that flower bed.

- que:
  - There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
  ans:
  - There's something buried there.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.

- que:
  - You can tell that from here?
  ans:
  - I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.

- que:
  - Would four of them -- ?
  ans:
  - No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.

- que:
  - Got a shovel?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
  ans:
  - Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.

- que:
  - What do you need money for?
  ans:
  - To bail Lisa out of jail.

- que:
  - How much do you think you'll need?
  ans:
  - First offense burglary -- -- probably two-fifty. The piggy bank.

- que:
  - What about the rest?
  ans:
  - When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.

- que:
  - Mrs. Doyle?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?
  ans:
  - Not yet, Jeff.

- que:
  - You haven't even heard from him?
  ans:
  - Not a word.

- que:
  - It is something really important, Jeff?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid it is, Tess.

- que:
  - Who's Thorwald?
  ans:
  - He knows. Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.

- que:
  - How's your leg?
  ans:
  - Mmmm -- hurts a little.

- que:
  - And your stomach?
  ans:
  - Empty as a football.

- que:
  - And you love life?
  ans:
  - Not too active.

- que:
  - Anything else bothering you?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
  ans:
  - Only because it's expected of her.

- que:
  - Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
  ans:
  - Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?

- que:
  - How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
  ans:
  - Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.

- que:
  - You mean leave the magazine?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That's what I'm afraid of. Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
  ans:
  - I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

- que:
  - Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
  ans:
  - Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?

- que:
  - Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
  ans:
  - Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours. You, of course, remember Miss Torso.

- que:
  - You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.

- que:
  - Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
  ans:
  - Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.

- que:
  - Three.
  ans:
  - Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?

- que:
  - If anything, I'm making it sound good. Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
  ans:
  - Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?

- que:
  - You don't think either one of us could ever change?
  ans:
  - Right now, it doesn't seem so.

- que:
  - Without any future?
  ans:
  - I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.

- que:
  - Don't you ever have any problems?
  ans:
  - I have one now.

- que:
  - Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
  ans:
  - He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.

- que:
  - Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
  ans:
  - Homework. It's more interesting.

- que:
  - What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
  ans:
  - Nothing, thank heaven.

- que:
  - Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't dare answer that.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.

- que:
  - Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
  ans:
  - She could be under sedatives, sleeping. He's in the room now.

- que:
  - You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
  ans:
  - That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.

- que:
  - Don't you see how silly you're being?
  ans:
  - The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.

- que:
  - What's the apartment house number?
  ans:
  - 125 West Ninth Street.

- que:
  - Someone not his wife?
  ans:
  - I never saw him ask her for advise before. But she volunteered plenty.

- que:
  - I wonder where he's going now?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Suppose he doesn't come back again?
  ans:
  - He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.

- que:
  - And you, and you friend Doyle -- Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
  ans:
  - Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.

- que:
  - Something on your mind, Lisa?
  ans:
  - It doesn't make sense to me.

- que:
  - What doesn't?
  ans:
  - Women aren't that unpredictable.

- que:
  - A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
  ans:
  - Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.

- que:
  - Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
  ans:
  - They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.

- que:
  - Inside stuff?
  ans:
  - Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.

- que:
  - That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
  ans:
  - That's what the witnesses told him.

- que:
  - We have all -- what?
  ans:
  - A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.

- que:
  - I do?
  ans:
  - Staying the night here, uninvited.

- que:
  - You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
  ans:
  - Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.

- que:
  - Who was the trunk addressed to?
  ans:
  - I'm not much on rear window ethics.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.

- que:
  - Do you like it?
  ans:
  - Well, -- if there was one less thread this way -- -- and two less that way -- -- I might give up bachelorhood.

- que:
  - But you're not?
  ans:
  - In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.

- que:
  - Is he cleaning house?
  ans:
  - He's washing down the bathroom walls.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.

- que:
  - Wasn't that close?
  ans:
  - Too close.

- que:
  - And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring! Do you ever leave yours at home?
  ans:
  - Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.

- que:
  - Shall we vote him in, Stella?
  ans:
  - Get an ambulance. Don't move. Try to lie still.

- que:
  - Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
  ans:
  - A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.

- que:
  - Your name?
  ans:
  - L. B. Jefferies.

- que:
  - Phone number?
  ans:
  - A new disease.

- que:
  - Friend of yours?
  ans:
  - I'm glad they let you out.

- que:
  - Feel okay?
  ans:
  - Give me some dirt.

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - Good luck, Buzz.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You watch too much television.

- que:
  - Chicken?
  ans:
  - I thought only punks fought with knives.

- que:
  - Machismo?
  ans:
  - Somebody find him a knife.

- que:
  - You satisfied or you want more?
  ans:
  - How 'bout you? Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.

- que:
  - Know the Millertown bluff?
  ans:
  - Just him.

- que:
  - What you say your name was?
  ans:
  - Jim Stark.

- que:
  - We heard firing. He get anybody? You alone?
  ans:
  - We got a cookaboo inside. He wounded some kid earlier.

- que:
  - How'd he get in?
  ans:
  - Smashed the front door.

- que:
  - Any other entrance?
  ans:
  - Down in back.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Hang loose. We got all night.

- que:
  - You still want to go home, Moose?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - It's just this get-up. The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
  ans:
  - Not just buy! You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough. We give you love and affection, don't we?

- que:
  - I better clean this up before she sees it.
  ans:
  - And you dropped it?

- que:
  - You awake?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer. I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
  ans:
  - I'm not hungry.

- que:
  - What would you do, Dad?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.

- que:
  - Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?
  ans:
  - Ten years? Now, Dad--I need an answer now!

- que:
  - I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
  ans:
  - You don't want me to go.

- que:
  - No! It's nothing! Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?
  ans:
  - He depended on me.

- que:
  - Sorry.
  ans:
  - You don't?

- que:
  - Excuse us a minute?
  ans:
  - Sure. Sure.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I think I know my son.

- que:
  - Can't you answer? What's the matter with you anyhow?
  ans:
  - He's just loaded, honey.

- que:
  - He's home. I heard the car.
  ans:
  - What's that pounding?

- que:
  - Look--just relax, will you?
  ans:
  - See? It stopped.

- que:
  - Who's there? Anyone there?
  ans:
  - Open it.

- que:
  - Is he there?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
  ans:
  - They not together, sir. We don't see him in a long time now.

- que:
  - Well maybe she better start.
  ans:
  - Do you hear from him, son?

- que:
  - Do you know why you shot those puppies, John? Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
  ans:
  - Plato.

- que:
  - Where did you get the gun?
  ans:
  - In my mother's drawer.

- que:
  - Look--can't you see I'm writing?
  ans:
  - I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him. It's very important.

- que:
  - He's not here. He's not at Juvenile Hall. I don't know where he is. He's out on a call and he'll be out all night. How old are you?
  ans:
  - My parents know I'm out. They know I'm here.

- que:
  - Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? Ever been booked before?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - You shouldn't monkey with him.
  ans:
  - You remember me?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Plato. It's a nickname.

- que:
  - You scared?
  ans:
  - I just don't want trouble.

- que:
  - I saw it. Gee, look at that thing swing, will you? Do you think it never stops?
  ans:
  - No. In the morning.

- que:
  - How'd you get here?
  ans:
  - I hitched.

- que:
  - My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
  ans:
  - No. It's okay.

- que:
  - I got to go in. You better get home too. Hey--what?
  ans:
  - Why don't you come home with me? I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you? I don't have many--people I can talk to.

- que:
  - Who has?
  ans:
  - Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I think they're going to kill you.

- que:
  - They think you told the police on them. They--who's in there?
  ans:
  - No. I'm scared.

- que:
  - Isn't it crazy?
  ans:
  - Wowee ow wow! Let's take it for the summer.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Not lately.

- que:
  - How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
  ans:
  - I had to go to a head-shrinker. I only went twice though. My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.

- que:
  - When was that?
  ans:
  - When I was here? When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Mom and Dad. I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.

- que:
  - Plato?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - Boy, I'm blind as a bat! You got a match? I'm going to break my neck in here. Where are you?
  ans:
  - I've got a gun.

- que:
  - That's swell. How are you?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
  ans:
  - No. At dawn.

- que:
  - I just have a feeling. Where are you?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
  ans:
  - We didn't run out. We were coming right back.

- que:
  - Sure I'm sure. Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - My gun?
  ans:
  - In your pocket. Give it to me.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Just a guard.

- que:
  - What's that got to do with it?
  ans:
  - Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.

- que:
  - Do I have to spell it out?
  ans:
  - Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.

- que:
  - Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
  ans:
  - Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.

- que:
  - Grandma?
  ans:
  - Get lost.

- que:
  - Too bad you didn't connect. You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Sure it is. You want to bug us till we have to lock you up. Why?
  ans:
  - I just get so-- Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY Okay. Okay. Let it out.

- que:
  - You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
  ans:
  - Try the desk.

- que:
  - Mess that kid up?
  ans:
  - He called me chicken.

- que:
  - And your folks didn't understand?
  ans:
  - They never do.

- que:
  - So then you moved?
  ans:
  - They think I'll make friends if we move. Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.

- que:
  - You got me, Jim--but they do. Want some water?
  ans:
  - Hey! That's enough static out of you.

- que:
  - Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
  ans:
  - Cut it out now. I'm warning you.

- que:
  - Who lives?
  ans:
  - See, I'm new.

- que:
  - University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
  ans:
  - The kids take me.

- que:
  - They'll be looking for you.
  ans:
  - A what?

- que:
  - They saw where I jumped! I didn't chicken! What do I have to do-- kill myself?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter to them.

- que:
  - I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
  ans:
  - You were looking for me, weren't you?

- que:
  - You still pretty upset?
  ans:
  - I'm numb.

- que:
  - You cold?
  ans:
  - Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.

- que:
  - No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm getting that way, too.

- que:
  - So have I. But I've never been in love. Isn't that awful?
  ans:
  - Awful? No. It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.

- que:
  - Why did you do that?
  ans:
  - I felt like it.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but we can't stay here.

- que:
  - Listen! I know a place! PLATO showed me before. An old deserted mansion near the planetarium Would you go with me?
  ans:
  - You decide, darling. Remember our budget.

- que:
  - Ever been in a place like this before?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. It's certainly huge.

- que:
  - How many rooms do you think there are?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn't this the craziest?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato. That was nice.

- que:
  - You disappointed?
  ans:
  - Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You smell like baby powder.

- que:
  - I love somebody. All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody. And it's so easy. Why is it easy now?
  ans:
  - It is for me too.

- que:
  - After he tried to shoot you?
  ans:
  - Yes. My best friend.

- que:
  - What's he like?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. You have to get to know him. He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it. He's sincere.

- que:
  - Oh, we can manage that! I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
  ans:
  - Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?

- que:
  - Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry. I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
  ans:
  - It's all right.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He hates me.

- que:
  - Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
  ans:
  - I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them. I hate my life. I just hate it.

- que:
  - You weren't looking for company, were you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you enjoy that?
  ans:
  - No. I don't even know why I do it.

- que:
  - My mother?
  ans:
  - She's being called for.

- que:
  - How did you know that?
  ans:
  - Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo. I thought you stopped doing that long ago.

- que:
  - Girls don't love their father? Since when? Since I got to be sixteen?
  ans:
  - Don't hurt him...

- que:
  - Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
  ans:
  - Please, Gabriel, don't...

  ans:
  - Not without you.

  ans:
  - We need to find a way to make me part of it.

  ans:
  - It's a scene. Memorize it.

- que:
  - But what is this?
  ans:
  - It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.

- que:
  - I gotta memorize all this shit?
  ans:
  - I can do that.

  - What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
  ans:
  - I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.

- que:
  - Wong?
  ans:
  - Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.

- que:
  - Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
  ans:
  - Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

- que:
  - Why can't we pick out our own colors?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.

- que:
  - Mr. Blue's dead?
  ans:
  - Dead as Dillinger.

- que:
  - I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
  ans:
  - Give me this fucking thing.

- que:
  - What's she doin' now?
  ans:
  - She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.

- que:
  - Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
  ans:
  - He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.

- que:
  - How many employees?
  ans:
  - No, they're not.

- que:
  - What's the cut, poppa?
  ans:
  - Juicy, junior, real juicy.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you talking about?
  ans:
  - That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.

- que:
  - That's your proof?
  ans:
  - You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.

- que:
  - Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
  ans:
  - Mr. Pink.

- que:
  - Mr. Pink? Why?
  ans:
  - He don't tip.

- que:
  - He don't tip? You don't tip? Why?
  ans:
  - He don't believe in it.

- que:
  - He don't believe in it? You don't believe in it?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Aren't you?
  ans:
  - I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Your name's Freddy something.

- que:
  - What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
  ans:
  - I do. How do I look?

- que:
  - Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
  ans:
  - Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.

- que:
  - What're you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.

- que:
  - Follow you where?
  ans:
  - Down to my car.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's a surprise.

- que:
  - For what, the cops?
  ans:
  - Nice Guy Eddie.

- que:
  - You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
  ans:
  - You didn't ask.

- que:
  - Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
  ans:
  - Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.

- que:
  - That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
  ans:
  - I don't like alarms.

- que:
  - Correct.
  ans:
  - Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?

- que:
  - You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
  ans:
  - I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

- que:
  - EDDIE Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
  ans:
  - EDDIE C'mon, throw in a buck.

- que:
  - EDDIE Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
  ans:
  - I don't believe in it.

- que:
  - EDDIE I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
  ans:
  - EDDIE I'd go over twelve percent for that.

- que:
  - Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
  ans:
  - Dead.

- que:
  - Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
  ans:
  - How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.

- que:
  - As opposed to good?
  ans:
  - This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.

- que:
  - You really think we were set up?
  ans:
  - I'm cool.

- que:
  - That's not correct.
  ans:
  - Want a smoke?

- que:
  - What's wrong with it?
  ans:
  - The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.

- que:
  - Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
  ans:
  - Look, enough of this \"Mr White\" shit -

- que:
  - You're right, this is bad. How did you get out?
  ans:
  - Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.

- que:
  - Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
  ans:
  - A few cops.

- que:
  - No real people?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh, just cops.

- que:
  - Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
  ans:
  - Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.

- que:
  - Nope.
  ans:
  - Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?

- que:
  - How can you be so sure?
  ans:
  - I got the diamonds.

- que:
  - Where? Are they out in the car?
  ans:
  - That was the plan, we meet here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.

- que:
  - No shit?
  ans:
  - Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.

- que:
  - I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
  ans:
  - Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.

- que:
  - So, is he dead or what?
  ans:
  - He ain't dead.

- que:
  - So what is it?
  ans:
  - I think he's just passed out.

- que:
  - You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
  ans:
  - I told him my first name, and where I'm from.

- que:
  - And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
  ans:
  - He asked.

- que:
  - One question, Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Is that supposed to be funny?
  ans:
  - You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.

- que:
  - You takin' his side?
  ans:
  - I told ya he'd be pissed.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do about him?
  ans:
  - He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.

- que:
  - Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
  ans:
  - Not these guys.

- que:
  - We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
  ans:
  - I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.

- que:
  - And that's more important than finding Lednov?
  ans:
  - Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.

- que:
  - Who shot who?
  ans:
  - Nobody. The light was bad.

- que:
  - I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
  ans:
  - All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.

- que:
  - Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
  ans:
  - This must have been in the family a long time.

- que:
  - As far as -- Sonora?
  ans:
  - Just about.

- que:
  - What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
  ans:
  - You can stay here if you like.

- que:
  - Our kind of women?
  ans:
  - You'll have to drive -- except down hill.

- que:
  - Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
  ans:
  - And this is Helen Carter.

- que:
  - Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
  ans:
  - Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.

- que:
  - But you eat, don't you?
  ans:
  - Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.

- que:
  - Where do you keep the can opener?
  ans:
  - Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.

- que:
  - If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
  ans:
  - I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.

- que:
  - Would you, Mr. Phillips?
  ans:
  - Go on, there's a good boy.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like sticking his nose into other people's business.

- que:
  - Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
  ans:
  - They're stragglin'.

- que:
  - Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
  ans:
  - No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.

- que:
  - Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
  ans:
  - Hold on.

- que:
  - Coffee?
  ans:
  - I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.

- que:
  - The who?
  ans:
  - You should know. She's in your dream.

- que:
  - Will she be dark or fair?
  ans:
  - Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.

- que:
  - Are we leaving?
  ans:
  - It's too light yet.

- que:
  - You're not going out to look for them?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.

- que:
  - Don't you trust me?
  ans:
  - Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.

- que:
  - Why do you think?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.

- que:
  - You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
  ans:
  - Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.

- que:
  - What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
  ans:
  - I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - To the other side of the street.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I haven't got the job yet.

- que:
  - No they won't.
  ans:
  - Which ranch?

- que:
  - How does she draw?
  ans:
  - A little hot.

- que:
  - Who's Lednov?
  ans:
  - A man I used to know.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.

- que:
  - No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
  ans:
  - Nice.

- que:
  - But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
  ans:
  - The thing to do is stick to rabbits.

- que:
  - What was he in jail for?
  ans:
  - You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.

- que:
  - In a fight?
  ans:
  - The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.

- que:
  - You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us. Think he will?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - At the ranch maybe?
  ans:
  - Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.

- que:
  - Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
  ans:
  - All right. I'll tell you.

- que:
  - He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
  ans:
  - Lednov.

- que:
  - Where'd they go?
  ans:
  - Swimming.

- que:
  - How'd you happen to miss?
  ans:
  - They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.

- que:
  - Can I have my gun back?
  ans:
  - Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.

- que:
  - Finished, son?
  ans:
  - There's only two of them now.

- que:
  - Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
  ans:
  - I don't care what she asked you.

- que:
  - Sure. What other reason would there be?
  ans:
  - I just wondered. Let's go.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Kind of sore.

- que:
  - Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.

- que:
  - So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
  ans:
  - I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.

- que:
  - Yeah, how did you know?
  ans:
  - The whole state's lookin' for 'em. And they're lookin' for me.

- que:
  - What's there to be fair about?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.

- que:
  - What's there to be fair about?
  ans:
  - You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.

- que:
  - What's botherin' you, anyway?
  ans:
  - Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.

- que:
  - Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
  ans:
  - Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?

- que:
  - That something I shouldn't see?
  ans:
  - No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Just a thing I was workin' on.

- que:
  - You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
  ans:
  - That sure smells good.

- que:
  - You're sure there's more where this came from?
  ans:
  - Plenty more. And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.

- que:
  - What's the matter -- restless?
  ans:
  - Yes, people make me restless.

- que:
  - Even women?
  ans:
  - There aren't any women here.

- que:
  - Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. Can I make it?
  ans:
  - Depends on how good you drive.

- que:
  - How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
  ans:
  - Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.

- que:
  - You're not giving up?
  ans:
  - How many ways can a man say no.

- que:
  - Clay Phillips.
  ans:
  - How do you know who we are?

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Up the trail.

- que:
  - How far up the trail?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- I don't know.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Because there's a man I want to see.

- que:
  - Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
  ans:
  - I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.

- que:
  - Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
  ans:
  - Since I can remember, Ma'am.

- que:
  - Would you like to learn them?
  ans:
  - I sure would.

- que:
  - Did someone say I wasn't nice?
  ans:
  - That's the end of the line.

- que:
  - And that's tough, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Without someone to teach you, it's tough.

- que:
  - What do they look like?
  ans:
  - Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.

- que:
  - Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Would they be good to eat?
  ans:
  - Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...

- que:
  - An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
  ans:
  - I feel good anyways.

- que:
  - Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
  ans:
  - Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.

- que:
  - And you've got me all figured out?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.

- que:
  - That's always tough. How long were you together?
  ans:
  - No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...

- que:
  - Alex, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.

- que:
  - In room \"302\" at ten o'clock?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. Hey, what class do we have next?
  ans:
  - Psychology.

- que:
  - Shhh... It's okay.
  ans:
  - Cindy, what's going on?

- que:
  - Ray, have you been here all this time?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.

- que:
  - Where's Shorty?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.

- que:
  - Then what kinda stuff can we do?
  ans:
  - Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.

- que:
  - Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
  ans:
  - Sure. We can practice talking.

- que:
  - Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
  ans:
  - It looks like the furnace.

- que:
  - Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
  ans:
  - Hugh Kane.

- que:
  - That we should take our friendship a little further?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - What about you, Buddy?
  ans:
  - Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.

- que:
  - Can you feel that?
  ans:
  - No. Try a little higher.

- que:
  - Feel that?
  ans:
  - No. Keep rubbing.

- que:
  - Then what are we going to do?
  ans:
  - You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...

- que:
  - Hey, wanna' share a soda?
  ans:
  - Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.

- que:
  - What should we get?
  ans:
  - I don't care. You pick.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - What, you think I did this to myself?
  ans:
  - Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.

- que:
  - So, whatever happened to her?
  ans:
  - She killed herself a week before he died.

- que:
  - Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - It's the sequel.

- que:
  - How about these buns?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they're so warm and soft.

- que:
  - This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
  ans:
  - The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.

- que:
  - What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
  ans:
  - Right behind you.

- que:
  - Where's Shorty?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.

- que:
  - Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I broke my fall.

- que:
  - This can't be happening?
  ans:
  - I don't need your help.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just wait, you'll see.

- que:
  - What are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....

- que:
  - Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
  ans:
  - Soon, but first I must bless this house.

- que:
  - So, do you think you made it into the class?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but I sure hope so.

- que:
  - Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
  ans:
  - Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Gear. You know, clothing.

- que:
  - Am I cool now?
  ans:
  - Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.

- que:
  - Did you do that?
  ans:
  - Uh, uh.

- que:
  - Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
  ans:
  - That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.

- que:
  - Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
  ans:
  - Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.

- que:
  - Professor, what's the history of this house?
  ans:
  - I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.

- que:
  - Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
  ans:
  - Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.

- que:
  - Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
  ans:
  - It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.

- que:
  - What are you getting at, Professor?
  ans:
  - Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.

- que:
  - Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
  ans:
  - I take it you're not mad at me.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.

- que:
  - Are these all the subjects?
  ans:
  - Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.

- que:
  - Any of them hot?
  ans:
  - I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.

- que:
  - Willing? I like that. And, this one?
  ans:
  - That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.

- que:
  - Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
  ans:
  - They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.

- que:
  - How are we going to get them all up there?
  ans:
  - I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.

- que:
  - And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
  ans:
  - In about fifteen minutes.

- que:
  - Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
  ans:
  - Right. What about condoms?

- que:
  - Fine. What's all this stuff?
  ans:
  - Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.

- que:
  - Are those cameras all throughout the house?
  ans:
  - Yes, I thought that it would be best.

- que:
  - So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
  ans:
  - That one.

- que:
  - My God! Is she dead?
  ans:
  - No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.

- que:
  - What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
  ans:
  - No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.

- que:
  - Are you sure it's not the tape?
  ans:
  - Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.

- que:
  - What is it, Dwight?
  ans:
  - I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.

- que:
  - That's why we came here, remember?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.

- que:
  - What are you working on?
  ans:
  - Just a little experiment.

- que:
  - Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
  ans:
  - Well, there's a lot riding on this project.

- que:
  - Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
  ans:
  - Just a little Rogaine.

- que:
  - What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
  ans:
  - Oh, I couldn't do that.

- que:
  - I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
  ans:
  - That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.

- que:
  - My help?
  ans:
  - A little bit... Give me your belt.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.

- que:
  - Would you like to see the girl?
  ans:
  - Soon. First, I must bless this house.

- que:
  - Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Because she will lie?
  ans:
  - No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.

- que:
  - What she said about your mother?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
  ans:
  - Shorty, why don't you say grace?

- que:
  - Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
  ans:
  - What does it say?

- que:
  - Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
  ans:
  - Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.

- que:
  - How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her! Should she be the next victim?
  ans:
  - Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.

- que:
  - Sure do. Did you bring back \"Ghost Dad\"?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Mom.

- que:
  - God, Mom! What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.

- que:
  - Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
  ans:
  - Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.

- que:
  - Are you Chip Sutphin?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Detectives, what is this about?
  ans:
  - Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!

- que:
  - Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
  ans:
  - Bird books mostly...

- que:
  - Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.

- que:
  - Don't I get a kiss?
  ans:
  - I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...

- que:
  - It's fine with me, Beverly. You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
  ans:
  - We can be real quiet...

- que:
  - What a mess.
  ans:
  - Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?

- que:
  - Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
  ans:
  - I certainly did.

- que:
  - Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
  ans:
  - Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.

- que:
  - Hello.
  ans:
  - Who's voice was it, Dottie?

- que:
  - Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
  ans:
  - The police are tracing your call right this minute.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
  ans:
  - One beer with lunch is hardly \"drinking\".

- que:
  - So you do drink?
  ans:
  - Socially... I'll have a beer.

- que:
  - Marvin A. Pickles.
  ans:
  - So you admit you just lied?

- que:
  - Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
  ans:
  - Yes, I was.

- que:
  - Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
  ans:
  - I... I'm not sure... ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...

- que:
  - Who wants fruit salad?
  ans:
  - I do, please.

- que:
  - That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
  ans:
  - It's sugarless.

- que:
  - And who may I ask is Carl?
  ans:
  - Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine. Thanks for remembering.

- que:
  - Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.

- que:
  - I'm not that bad a driver. Look at her hair! Turn it off, honey.
  ans:
  - Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?

- que:
  - You want me to keep that under the table for you?
  ans:
  - If you wouldn't mind... It was on sale.

- que:
  - Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
  ans:
  - ...Browsing.

- que:
  - That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I lent it...

- que:
  - And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
  ans:
  - Yes... but... I didn't...

- que:
  - Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
  ans:
  - No... I don't have room in my kitchen...

- que:
  - There is one big problem though.
  ans:
  - Mrs... Sutphin?

- que:
  - What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
  ans:
  - His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.

- que:
  - Divorce? An alcoholic relative? Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
  ans:
  - No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.

- que:
  - Are we leaving?
  ans:
  - Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.

- que:
  - Nice one, huh? Winter's coming. Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
  ans:
  - What's he know?

- que:
  - You know who I am, August?
  ans:
  - Sure I do.

- que:
  - Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
  ans:
  - You can?

- que:
  - Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
  ans:
  - Yes. She bought my sister's business.

- que:
  - You think my sister is there?
  ans:
  - You can't tell.

- que:
  - Can we go there now?
  ans:
  - Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.

- que:
  - Which room is it?
  ans:
  - It's the last door at the end of this hall.

- que:
  - You scared?
  ans:
  - Yes, I understand.

- que:
  - Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
  ans:
  - You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?

- que:
  - What sort of danger?
  ans:
  - She could use a hundred dollars.

- que:
  - How much have you got?
  ans:
  - About forty-five dollars.

- que:
  - Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
  ans:
  - Oh, as beautiful as ever.

- que:
  - Hello, Frances.
  ans:
  - What circumstances?

- que:
  - How's Miss Jacqueline?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.

- que:
  - You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
  ans:
  - I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.

- que:
  - Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
  ans:
  - Redi's all right.

- que:
  - What does she do with herself after business hours?
  ans:
  - It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.

- que:
  - Do you know what this is, Frances?
  ans:
  - I ought to know.

- que:
  - What did she want?
  ans:
  - I did her hair.

- que:
  - What were you talking about?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - And that was all?
  ans:
  - No. She asked about the trademark.

- que:
  - What did she want to know?
  ans:
  - She showed me a drawing.

- que:
  - Then you know where Jacqueline is?
  ans:
  - But I'd give a great deal to know.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.

- que:
  - Weren't you afraid?
  ans:
  - The important thing is, the police won't believe you.

- que:
  - A job?
  ans:
  - I'd like that.

- que:
  - The people at the restaurant?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
  ans:
  - What brought you down here, Greg?

- que:
  - What have you done about Irving August?
  ans:
  - Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.

- que:
  - Who the devil is he?
  ans:
  - A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.

- que:
  - What things? Why?
  ans:
  - She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.

- que:
  - No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.

- que:
  - Do you think he knows about this?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Could you find him?
  ans:
  - I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.

- que:
  - Let her know what?
  ans:
  - That you love Mary.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.

- que:
  - Why wait?
  ans:
  - I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.

- que:
  - And then?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You'll be all right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you knew he'd be here.
  ans:
  - Were you going to make a suggestion?

- que:
  - Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
  ans:
  - I want you to look for Jacqueline.

- que:
  - You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
  ans:
  - Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.

- que:
  - And you believe that?
  ans:
  - I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Mary?
  ans:
  - Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.

- que:
  - What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
  ans:
  - Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.

- que:
  - Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules. When did you say you wanted them?
  ans:
  - I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.

- que:
  - And the other was Judd?
  ans:
  - Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.

- que:
  - Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
  ans:
  - What a peculiar question.

- que:
  - I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
  ans:
  - My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.

- que:
  - But why come to me?
  ans:
  - She was my patient.

- que:
  - What was she to you?
  ans:
  - I don't think that you would understand if I told you.

- que:
  - Following me to find Jacqueline?
  ans:
  - Uhhuh.

- que:
  - And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
  ans:
  - It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.

- que:
  - Why not let your publisher judge that?
  ans:
  - Wait - there is that other favor.

- que:
  - You don't expect me to do that do you?
  ans:
  - Yes. When I tell you.

- que:
  - Tell me what?
  ans:
  - You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.

- que:
  - No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
  ans:
  - Perhaps.

- que:
  - I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
  ans:
  - She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.

- que:
  - A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
  ans:
  - It might have.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They may have found her. Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.

- que:
  - Dr. Judd?
  ans:
  - Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.

- que:
  - You know where she is?
  ans:
  - If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.

- que:
  - Cloven hoof?
  ans:
  - Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.

- que:
  - Would they hurt her?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
  ans:
  - Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --

- que:
  - Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
  ans:
  - I haven't said anything of the sort.

- que:
  - But you would like to know where she is?
  ans:
  - Yes. There are certain punitive measures...

- que:
  - Unless what?
  ans:
  - It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.

- que:
  - Is it about Jacqueline?
  ans:
  - No. She's no longer under my care.

- que:
  - You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
  ans:
  - This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.

- que:
  - I'm afraid not.
  ans:
  - No, she's with her sister,

- que:
  - There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
  ans:
  - Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.

- que:
  - She's not been here for a long time.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
  ans:
  - Yes -- and pays the rent every month.

- que:
  - Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
  ans:
  - No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.

- que:
  - Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
  ans:
  - We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.

- que:
  - Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.

- que:
  - Is it fifteen minutes yet?
  ans:
  - No, Nancy. You've got to sleep two more minutes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.

- que:
  - It won't hurt.
  ans:
  - When?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Graham Dalton.

- que:
  - Do you have other things?
  ans:
  - Yes. Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.

- que:
  - Television?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No. Why?
  ans:
  - Curious.

- que:
  - Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
  ans:
  - No, I think you look... fine.

- que:
  - You play an instrument?
  ans:
  - Oh, I like it. I like it very much.

- que:
  - How long has it been since you've seen John?
  ans:
  - Nine years.

- que:
  - Nine years?
  ans:
  - Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.

- que:
  - Why? Didn't you know him well?
  ans:
  - I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.

- que:
  - Why'd you drop out?
  ans:
  - Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.

- que:
  - Sister older or younger?
  ans:
  - Younger.

- que:
  - Who's Elizabeth?
  ans:
  - Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.

- que:
  - What's the first?
  ans:
  - Lawyers.

- que:
  - Would you mind?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - I feel like they do.

- que:
  - Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
  ans:
  - Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.

- que:
  - Do you want them?
  ans:
  - Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.

- que:
  - Do you want me to?
  ans:
  - As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.

- que:
  - You're what?
  ans:
  - Impotent.

- que:
  - Well... are you self-conscious about it?
  ans:
  - I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.

- que:
  - So you don't believe in therapy?
  ans:
  - Well, my therapist knows me intimately.

- que:
  - You had sex with you therapist?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
  ans:
  - Well, I wasn't always impotent.

- que:
  - Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
  ans:
  - Basically, yes.

- que:
  - Ann. Hello.
  ans:
  - That's correct. Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?

- que:
  - Are you in the middle of something?
  ans:
  - Nothing I can't finish later.

- que:
  - What are these?
  ans:
  - Videotapes.

- que:
  - I can see that. What are they?
  ans:
  - It's a personal project I'm working on.

- que:
  - What kind of personal project?
  ans:
  - Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.

- que:
  - Donna?
  ans:
  - Donna. On this tape it says \"Donna\".

- que:
  - You went out with her?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - All of these are interviews?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can we look at one?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.

- que:
  - What... what are these interviews about?
  ans:
  - The... interviews are about sex, Ann.

- que:
  - About sex?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What about sex?
  ans:
  - Everything about sex.

- que:
  - You just ask them questions?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And they just answer them?
  ans:
  - Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

- que:
  - To you?
  ans:
  - No, not to me, for me, for the camera.

- que:
  - I don't... why... why do you do this?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry this came up.

- que:
  - You know?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did you know?
  ans:
  - She said it on her tape.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.

- que:
  - Don't you want to make one?
  ans:
  - Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.

- que:
  - What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
  ans:
  - That's a good question.

- que:
  - What do you have to do to get ready?
  ans:
  - Load a new tape, turn the camera on.

- que:
  - It won't. Are you ready?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - When we're making love?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Does he go down on you?
  ans:
  - You don't know what I'm thinking.

- que:
  - Is he going to see this?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not.

- que:
  - Did you have sex before you were married?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
  ans:
  - Yes, I have. I will.

- que:
  - Do you want me to stop?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
  ans:
  - Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?

- que:
  - So you do fantasize?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - About who?
  ans:
  - I fantasized about you.

- que:
  - About me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Have you fantasized about me?
  ans:
  - I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.

- que:
  - I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - On tape?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.

- que:
  - Can't or won't?
  ans:
  - Can't.

- que:
  - Who was the last person you had sex with?
  ans:
  - Her name was Elizabeth.

- que:
  - So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
  ans:
  - No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.

- que:
  - What was the problem?
  ans:
  - The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always \"recovering\".

- que:
  - So you lied to her?
  ans:
  - Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.

- que:
  - And now you can?
  ans:
  - Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.

- que:
  - Don't you get lonely?
  ans:
  - I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.

- que:
  - Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
  ans:
  - Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.

- que:
  - If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...

- que:
  - And you feel the same way with John?
  ans:
  - I'm not planning on it.

- que:
  - If you were in love with me, would you?
  ans:
  - I'm not in love with you.

- que:
  - But if you were?
  ans:
  - I... I can't answer that precisely.

- que:
  - I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
  ans:
  - I can't.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I've told you.

- que:
  - Who? Elizabeth?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You mean you're still in contact with her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - But you're planning to be?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Possibly.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
  ans:
  - Not entirely.

- que:
  - But that was part of it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Like maybe a big part?
  ans:
  - Possibly.

- que:
  - Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.

- que:
  - Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
  ans:
  - Don't do that.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because.

- que:
  - I want to know why you are the way you are!
  ans:
  - Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?

- que:
  - But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
  ans:
  - I want to touch you.

- que:
  - You did that?
  ans:
  - Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.

- que:
  - John?
  ans:
  - Mmmmm...

- que:
  - I called you Tuesday at 3,30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
  ans:
  - Tuesday. I had a late lunch.

- que:
  - Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
  ans:
  - Yes. I just got busy.

- que:
  - Who'd you have lunch with?
  ans:
  - I ate by myself.

- que:
  - Well, are you?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.

- que:
  - My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
  ans:
  - For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.

- que:
  - Is that supposed to comfort me?
  ans:
  - Always the lawyer.

- que:
  - Isn't therapy helping at all?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I want out of this marriage.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.

- que:
  - Where did you go when you left here?
  ans:
  - I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?

- que:
  - Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't.

- que:
  - What upsets you about that?
  ans:
  - I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.

- que:
  - This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
  ans:
  - Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.

- que:
  - When did you begin having this feeling?
  ans:
  - About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.

- que:
  - Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
  ans:
  - Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.

- que:
  - Did you masturbate?
  ans:
  - God, no.

- que:
  - I take it you've never masturbated?
  ans:
  - No, I haven't.

- que:
  - What visitor?
  ans:
  - The friend of John's that was staying at your house.

- que:
  - Is he still at your house?
  ans:
  - No, he left last week.

- que:
  - What brought this on?
  ans:
  - I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.

- que:
  - I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
  ans:
  - That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.

- que:
  - You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That you are under no obligation to me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you want to leave therapy?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
  ans:
  - I hate my sister.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.

- que:
  - Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
  ans:
  - No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I just want to know what he looks like, is all.

- que:
  - Why, so you can go after him?
  ans:
  - Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know what. You say it just to irritate me.

- que:
  - \"My type\"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what \"my type\" is?
  ans:
  - I have a pretty good idea.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.

- que:
  - And what?
  ans:
  - And... do whatever it is you do.

- que:
  - Lose something?
  ans:
  - That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.

- que:
  - Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.

- que:
  - Okay, Ann, okay. How about this, you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I never got around to it.

- que:
  - Well, why?
  ans:
  - Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.

- que:
  - Then what's the story, what's this \"strange\" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
  ans:
  - No, it's nothing like that.

- que:
  - Well, what? Is he dangerous?
  ans:
  - No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.

- que:
  - Well, what, then?
  ans:
  - I don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - Then why'd you call me?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What kinds of questions?
  ans:
  - Questions about sex.

- que:
  - Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
  ans:
  - Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.

- que:
  - Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
  ans:
  - Apparently.

- que:
  - Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
  ans:
  - Because I wanted to.

- que:
  - But why did you want to?
  ans:
  - I wanted him to see me.

- que:
  - Did he touch you?
  ans:
  - No, but I did.

- que:
  - You touched him?
  ans:
  - In front of him, Ann, yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.

- que:
  - So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
  ans:
  - No. I don't think they all did what I did.

- que:
  - Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
  ans:
  - I don't want to discuss it.

- que:
  - Then why do you keep asking about it?
  ans:
  - Here it is.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's a sun dress.

- que:
  - So what's my share of the dress?
  ans:
  - Thirty-two dollars.

- que:
  - Do you have my work number?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you take your clothes off?
  ans:
  - No, I touched me.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm Cynthia Bishop.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - I'm Ann Millaney's sister.

- que:
  - You want me to leave?
  ans:
  - I just want to know why you're here.

- que:
  - And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - She didn't tell you why she was upset?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - She didn't give you my address?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - How did you find me?
  ans:
  - I, uh, know a guy at the power company.

- que:
  - What do you get?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - Talking.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.

- que:
  - What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You just want to ask me questions?
  ans:
  - I just want to ask you questions.

- que:
  - And that's all?
  ans:
  - That's all.

- que:
  - Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Would anybody else see the tape?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.

- que:
  - How do we start?
  ans:
  - I turn on the camera. You start talking.

- que:
  - And you ask questions, right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How long will it take?
  ans:
  - That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.

- que:
  - Do I sit or stand?
  ans:
  - Whichever you prefer.

- que:
  - I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
  ans:
  - Just a moment.

- que:
  - My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
  ans:
  - Your first sexual experience.

- que:
  - Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
  ans:
  - No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.

- que:
  - How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
  ans:
  - When I was fourteen.

- que:
  - Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
  ans:
  - Very much live.

- que:
  - What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
  ans:
  - Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He said that my hand felt good.

- que:
  - Then what happened?
  ans:
  - Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.

- que:
  - Would you like me to take my pants off?
  ans:
  - If you wish. You're not wearing any underwear.

- que:
  - Do you like the way I look?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you think I'm pretty?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Prettier than Ann?
  ans:
  - Different.

- que:
  - Is that what he tells you?
  ans:
  - He doesn't have to tell me.

- que:
  - Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - No? Not even one more?
  ans:
  - I never do more than one. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - I can't talk you into it?
  ans:
  - No. You'll have to get somebody else.

- que:
  - Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
  ans:
  - I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.

- que:
  - How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
  ans:
  - I would.

- que:
  - Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
  ans:
  - Cynthia, I don't know.

- que:
  - Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.

- que:
  - Who said I was jealous?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - Afraid of getting caught?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
  ans:
  - Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.

- que:
  - You're intrigued?
  ans:
  - Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.

- que:
  - Not today. I've got other plans.
  ans:
  - John?

- que:
  - How about inviting me over to dinner?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Right now.

- que:
  - She's there? What's she doing there?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.

- que:
  - Look, I'll call you, okay?
  ans:
  - It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.

- que:
  - What's so stupid about it?
  ans:
  - That you... you don't even know the guy.

- que:
  - Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
  ans:
  - Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.

- que:
  - What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
  ans:
  - \"The wrong hands\"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - You told Ann about this?
  ans:
  - Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.

- que:
  - Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
  ans:
  - It hurts that you would say that to me.

- que:
  - Look, are we going to do it or not?
  ans:
  - Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Graham.

- que:
  - I know. Will you please leave now?
  ans:
  - Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.

- que:
  - No. You said three-fifty?
  ans:
  - Plus first and last month deposit.

- que:
  - Will you lease month-to-month?
  ans:
  - Not for three-fifty.

- que:
  - How about for five hundred?
  ans:
  - Everybody has a past.

- que:
  - What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
  ans:
  - A bonfire, probably.

- que:
  - You were prying before?
  ans:
  - Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.

- que:
  - Really. How'd it go?
  ans:
  - She held up very well.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.

- que:
  - You know which tapes! Where are they?
  ans:
  - God, you need help.

- que:
  - I'm not going to give you my keys.
  ans:
  - My keys?

- que:
  - Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
  ans:
  - Goddamit...

- que:
  - PHONE May I ask who's calling?
  ans:
  - John Millaney.

- que:
  - Mr. Millaney?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Hi. Want a drink?
  ans:
  - No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.

- que:
  - Was he nice to you?
  ans:
  - Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.

- que:
  - Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
  ans:
  - With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.

- que:
  - You're the one who found the bodies?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
  ans:
  - No, nothing.

- que:
  - How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
  ans:
  - He sounded fine.

- que:
  - Is that the man who called you up here?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.

- que:
  - Medical clinic?
  ans:
  - Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.

- que:
  - Kiss, kiss?
  ans:
  - Uh, OK. Sure.

- que:
  - C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
  ans:
  - No. Dotty's the last.

- que:
  - Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
  ans:
  - Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.

- que:
  - Anything wrong?
  ans:
  - No. I don't think so.

- que:
  - Well? Supper at my place?
  ans:
  - OK. But late.

- que:
  - Where is he now? Do you know?
  ans:
  - I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.

- que:
  - But where are you going?
  ans:
  - Down to the incinerator.

- que:
  - What do you want to call me at the office for?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.

- que:
  - You say something?
  ans:
  - Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.

- que:
  - Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
  ans:
  - I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.

- que:
  - Yes? Who is there?
  ans:
  - It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.

- que:
  - Want me to breathe deeply?
  ans:
  - Just breathe normally.

- que:
  - Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
  ans:
  - She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.

- que:
  - Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
  ans:
  - Didn't seem worried about them.

- que:
  - Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
  ans:
  - That's the one.

- que:
  - Gonna cut me open?
  ans:
  - Well, let's wait for the X-rays.

- que:
  - I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
  ans:
  - Well, at least you still talk the same.

- que:
  - Did I say anything?
  ans:
  - It's crazy.

- que:
  - Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready? Who cares?
  ans:
  - I don't get it.

- que:
  - But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
  ans:
  - OK. I'll think about it.

- que:
  - It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
  ans:
  - Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.

- que:
  - He didn't make it.
  ans:
  - OK, I bite. What does it look like?

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.

- que:
  - Yeah? What do I do then?
  ans:
  - OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.

- que:
  - Later, Brenda. Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - How's Brad?
  ans:
  - A wreck.

- que:
  - What's cookin', Bert?
  ans:
  - I tell you what's cooking. She made the blind see and it was a gift! Who was it from? Let's hear an 'F\" for...

- que:
  - About Brad's family?
  ans:
  - As Janet's parents this should be really easy. Your last clue... Mental Instability. You have thirty seconds.

- que:
  - Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
  ans:
  - I've caught it once or twice.

- que:
  - Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
  ans:
  - On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.

- que:
  - Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
  ans:
  - Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?

- que:
  - How did you come by this scenario?
  ans:
  - I am in Farley's employ -- and... ...we're discussing a network deal.

- que:
  - Why Janet?
  ans:
  - Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.

- que:
  - Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled. If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
  ans:
  - No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.

- que:
  - Who trusts experts?
  ans:
  - Out of self comes selflessness.

- que:
  - I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
  ans:
  - Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.

- que:
  - Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier is...
  ans:
  - McKinley?...McKinley?

- que:
  - Now Betty, don't overreact.
  ans:
  - ...closed?

- que:
  - Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver?
  ans:
  - Yes, Betty.

- que:
  - Are you spoken for this evening?
  ans:
  - Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.

- que:
  - In a little masquerade?
  ans:
  - He was a President.

- que:
  - Really. What'll I pin this on?
  ans:
  - He was adopted you know.

- que:
  - Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
  ans:
  - Sure thing.

- que:
  - We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight. Is this true?
  ans:
  - Absolutely correct.

- que:
  - Could you tell us a little about it?
  ans:
  - Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.

- que:
  - Could I do that later?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Brad! Oh, Brad.

- que:
  - What show?
  ans:
  - Poor Brad.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Your father doesn't like Mexicans.

- que:
  - Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you?
  ans:
  - Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.

- que:
  - Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself committed?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Officer.

- que:
  - Good! Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
  ans:
  - BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?

- que:
  - No...couldn't I do this later?
  ans:
  - I'm...happy.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - It's classical. Almost a textbook case...

- que:
  - Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
  ans:
  - Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.

- que:
  - Our field.
  ans:
  - Do you really think so?

- que:
  - What does he know about it?
  ans:
  - It's you we're concerned about, Janet.

- que:
  - Yes how are you, Janet? Are you happy?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Isn't she lovely?
  ans:
  - Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.

- que:
  - We all love Janet...Who do we love?
  ans:
  - Nice technique there... ...Cammi.

- que:
  - No, we're from San Diego. Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.

- que:
  - Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from \"One Life to Live\"?
  ans:
  - You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.

- que:
  - You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
  ans:
  - I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.

- que:
  - And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
  ans:
  - I liked it when you caught me fucking him.

- que:
  - It's Christine. Hey you.
  ans:
  - The fuck was that?

- que:
  - You guys having fun?
  ans:
  - Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.

- que:
  - I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
  ans:
  - So what's up?

- que:
  - Why are you being so defensive?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.

- que:
  - Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
  ans:
  - Bye.

- que:
  - Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
  ans:
  - Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - Huh.

- que:
  - Are you there? Miles?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm here.

- que:
  - Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
  ans:
  - Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.

- que:
  - You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
  ans:
  - Highliner.

- que:
  - Glass or bottle?
  ans:
  - Bottle.

- que:
  - You okay, Miles?
  ans:
  - I'm good.

- que:
  - A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
  ans:
  - Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.

- que:
  - Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. You boys hungry?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.

- que:
  - And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
  ans:
  - Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.

- que:
  - I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
  ans:
  - Two years ago, buddy.

- que:
  - She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.

- que:
  - Hey, guys. How's it going?
  ans:
  - Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.

- que:
  - Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Stephanie.

- que:
  - Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
  ans:
  - In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc.

- que:
  - You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
  ans:
  - Sure I know Maya. Real well.

- que:
  - Good. How're you?
  ans:
  - Great. You look great. You both do.

- que:
  - What happened to you guys?
  ans:
  - Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.

- que:
  - Are you a writer too?
  ans:
  - No, I'm an actor.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
  ans:
  - A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.

- que:
  - Maybe. Recognize this?
  ans:
  - That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.

- que:
  - Why did you tell them my book was being published?
  ans:
  - You said you had it all lined up.

- que:
  - Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
  ans:
  - Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.

- que:
  - Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. Yeah.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.

- que:
  - How about the new ending? Did you like that?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. Much better.

- que:
  - Whoa, why are we getting off?
  ans:
  - I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.

- que:
  - How old's she going to be?
  ans:
  - Um... seventy... something.

- que:
  - Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.

- que:
  - You still seeing that shrink?
  ans:
  - I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.

- que:
  - Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
  ans:
  - And Lexapro, yes.

- que:
  - So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
  ans:
  - I told you. Filet and salmon.

- que:
  - I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
  ans:
  - Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.

- que:
  - This is rose, right?
  ans:
  - Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.

- que:
  - What color is it supposed to be?
  ans:
  - Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...

- que:
  - I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
  ans:
  - Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.

- que:
  - When do we get to drink it?
  ans:
  - Now.

- que:
  - Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
  ans:
  - You know, you could work in a wine store.

- que:
  - Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
  ans:
  - Are you chewing gum?

- que:
  - You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
  ans:
  - Whoa.

- que:
  - So you're going to stop acting?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - You know her?
  ans:
  - Sure I know Maya.

- que:
  - You know that chick?
  ans:
  - She is very hot.

- que:
  - Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
  ans:
  - Well, she does know a lot about wine.

- que:
  - Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
  ans:
  - The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.

- que:
  - Have you no shame?
  ans:
  - Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

- que:
  - So what's the plan today?
  ans:
  - We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.

- que:
  - Nice, huh?
  ans:
  - Beautiful.

- que:
  - She what? When?
  ans:
  - About a month ago. Six weeks.

- que:
  - You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
  ans:
  - No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.

- que:
  - You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
  ans:
  - You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.

- que:
  - Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
  ans:
  - Get the trunk.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.

- que:
  - With Maya?
  ans:
  - Been divorced for a year now, bud.

- que:
  - You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
  ans:
  - Nah. I want to watch this.

- que:
  - So what should I wear?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
  ans:
  - Bathroom.

- que:
  - What'd Christine say?
  ans:
  - Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.

- que:
  - Where is Stephanie?
  ans:
  - Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - With this chick.

- que:
  - Besides what?
  ans:
  - Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, I've been doing some thinking.

- que:
  - Oh, you've been thinking. And?
  ans:
  - I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.

- que:
  - Understanding of what?
  ans:
  - Like I might be in love with another woman.

- que:
  - In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
  ans:
  - Look who's talking. You've been there.

- que:
  - And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
  ans:
  - You're crazy. You've gone crazy.

- que:
  - Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
  ans:
  - Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.

- que:
  - Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Can you give me some room here?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. Sure.

- que:
  - What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - What do you think's going on?
  ans:
  - Could be anything.

- que:
  - Been checking your messages?
  ans:
  - Obsessively.

- que:
  - But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
  ans:
  - Don't come over the top. Stay still.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

- que:
  - Is what the money thing?
  ans:
  - With Maya.

- que:
  - Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
  ans:
  - Slaughterhouse.

- que:
  - You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
  ans:
  - Huh.

- que:
  - Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
  ans:
  - Put me down, Jack.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's private.

- que:
  - Do you like them?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.

- que:
  - Are they too sporty?
  ans:
  - How about this one? We didn't hit this one.

- que:
  - You ever actually been in there, Miles?
  ans:
  - I don't have to.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.

- que:
  - Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
  ans:
  - No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.

- que:
  - What's it look like to you?
  ans:
  - Looks like you were in a bad car accident.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.

- que:
  - Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
  ans:
  - Ran. Twisted my ankle too.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.

- que:
  - She tell you she was married?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So what the fuck were you thinking?
  ans:
  - Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.

- que:
  - So what's the plan?
  ans:
  - The plan is... you go.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - My ankle. Just go explain the situation.

- que:
  - Hrnrnrn?
  ans:
  - That was quite a day yesterday.

- que:
  - Want me to drive?
  ans:
  - No, I'm okay.

- que:
  - Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
  ans:
  - You're so negative.

- que:
  - Well. That about does it.
  ans:
  - What's wrong?

- que:
  - Why don't you come in?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh. You're on your own.

- que:
  - Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured?
  ans:
  - You were wearing your belt.

- que:
  - I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
  ans:
  - You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.

- que:
  - You want to join us?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
  ans:
  - The Windmill.

- que:
  - What are you drinking?
  ans:
  - A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? How is it?
  ans:
  - Try it.

- que:
  - On a Sauvignon Blanc?
  ans:
  - I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.

- que:
  - So what gems do you have in your collection?
  ans:
  - You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up...

- que:
  - It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.

- que:
  - How long have you been into wine?
  ans:
  - I started to get serious about seven years ago.

- que:
  - What was the bottle that did it?
  ans:
  - Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

- que:
  - Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
  ans:
  - I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.

- que:
  - Is she sleeping or...?
  ans:
  - She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.

- que:
  - You got kids?
  ans:
  - Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.

- que:
  - Oh. You mean... today?
  ans:
  - Um... yeah but it's more...

- que:
  - So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
  ans:
  - Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.

- que:
  - A paper?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.

- que:
  - So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
  ans:
  - My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a personal question?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Yeah? Like what?
  ans:
  - Like what a fraud he was.

- que:
  - Bathroom over there?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - Um... did you still want to read my novel?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

- que:
  - Great. What's the latest we can get there?
  ans:
  - About two-thirty.

- que:
  - Were you ever going to say anything?
  ans:
  - Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.

- que:
  - Do you know what he's been saying to her?
  ans:
  - He's an actor, so it can't be good.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Victoria.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.

- que:
  - So how're you doing?
  ans:
  - Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.

- que:
  - So what's happening with your book?
  ans:
  - Universally rejected. Strike three.

- que:
  - Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.

- que:
  - You quit drinking?
  ans:
  - I'm pregnant.

- que:
  - How much skin and stem contact?
  ans:
  - About four weeks.

- que:
  - Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
  ans:
  - About a year.

- que:
  - French or American?
  ans:
  - Both.

- que:
  - Sir, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - I told you I need a drink.

- que:
  - So what do you think?
  ans:
  - We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

- que:
  - Where's Jack?
  ans:
  - He had to make a phone call.

- que:
  - So what are you up to today, Miles?
  ans:
  - Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.

- que:
  - You golf?
  ans:
  - Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - A famous actor who's getting married next week.

- que:
  - You talked to Wendy?
  ans:
  - Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.

- que:
  - Miles, when are you going to get married again?
  ans:
  - I just got divorced. Phyllis.

- que:
  - What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
  ans:
  - It tastes old.

- que:
  - What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
  ans:
  - Only for pee or poop.

- que:
  - Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
  ans:
  - It makes me feel better.

- que:
  - Does she ever answer back?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - This one?
  ans:
  - A hair.

- que:
  - This one?
  ans:
  - Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.

- que:
  - Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
  ans:
  - I heard them Morgan.

- que:
  - Who said I was going to die?
  ans:
  - I'm scared.

- que:
  - Does it hurt?
  ans:
  - I don't feel much.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - Clear for what?
  ans:
  - I got the bat at home... On the wall.

- que:
  - You got two minor league home run records don't you?
  ans:
  - Five. The five longest.

- que:
  - This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
  ans:
  - Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?

- que:
  - Explain, act crazy?
  ans:
  - Curse and stuff.

- que:
  - Are you going to do this or what?
  ans:
  - No I'm not.

- que:
  - You want him coming in the house next time?
  ans:
  - I cursed.

- que:
  - Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
  ans:
  - That roof is over ten feet high.

- que:
  - I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
  ans:
  - It's noise.

- que:
  - It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this. Let's get out of the car okay?
  ans:
  - It's probably picking up another baby monitor.

- que:
  - Do you think it's a possibility?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you feel comforted?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's furry, furry rabbit?
  ans:
  - That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Eleven a.m. They're gone.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Ray Reddy's house.

- que:
  - Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
  ans:
  - Chicken Teriyaki.

- que:
  - Should we turn off the lights?
  ans:
  - They already know we're here.

- que:
  - Should we make a run for it out the back?
  ans:
  - They're right behind the door.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I can feel air.

- que:
  - How many died?
  ans:
  - They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong.

- que:
  - How do they know it's over?
  ans:
  - A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now. They're leaving. Beat.

- que:
  - Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
  ans:
  - He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.

- que:
  - Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Morgan?
  ans:
  - It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.

- que:
  - Who wrote this book?
  ans:
  - Dad.

- que:
  - What's two?
  ans:
  - They win.

- que:
  - What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
  ans:
  - Sounds made up.

- que:
  - Where are we going to sleep?
  ans:
  - The family room.

- que:
  - What about Isabelle?
  ans:
  - We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.

- que:
  - I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
  ans:
  - Now we're talking. How about you Merrill?

- que:
  - Did someone save me?
  ans:
  - Yeah baby. I think someone did.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.

- que:
  - You said something was strange. What's strange?
  ans:
  - The footprints.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - There are none.

- que:
  - What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
  ans:
  - Second thing this week I can't explain.

- que:
  - What was the first thing?
  ans:
  - Sounds like a virus.

- que:
  - He definitely wasn't a midget.
  ans:
  - You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?

- que:
  - Okay. So he was tall?
  ans:
  - I would say so.

- que:
  - Is anything missing?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is he okay?
  ans:
  - Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.

- que:
  - Pinned? What does that mean?
  ans:
  - The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.

- que:
  - Is that him?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
  ans:
  - Don't worry.

- que:
  - Posse? What the hell you talking about?
  ans:
  - You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.

- que:
  - No money, eh?
  ans:
  - The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.

- que:
  - Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
  ans:
  - You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.

- que:
  - That's why they got you in jail?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.

- que:
  - ...And you had to kill him?
  ans:
  - No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.

- que:
  - You're in here for winging a guy?
  ans:
  - Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.

- que:
  - What friend is that?
  ans:
  - The one with the shotgun.

- que:
  - Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
  ans:
  - Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.

- que:
  - There's nobody coming?
  ans:
  - Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.

- que:
  - Did it seem short to you?
  ans:
  - That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.

- que:
  - Someplace safe. How you feeling?
  ans:
  - I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.

- que:
  - Where's Jake?
  ans:
  - McKendrick's men got him.

- que:
  - Kate?
  ans:
  - She was hurt... pretty bad. Emmett, they took the little boy with them.

- que:
  - Have you thought at all about your plans?
  ans:
  - Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.

- que:
  - Goodbye?
  ans:
  - Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.

- que:
  - Didn't Paden tell you that?
  ans:
  - Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - This is a brutal land.

- que:
  - How's Mr. Parker doing?
  ans:
  - Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.

- que:
  - Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
  ans:
  - I already did that.

- que:
  - You're not Baxter?
  ans:
  - My name is Emmett.

- que:
  - Hobart, what are you people doing here?
  ans:
  - This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.

- que:
  - Offend anybody lately?
  ans:
  - Not for five years.

- que:
  - Jefferson City?
  ans:
  - No, Leavenworth.

- que:
  - I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
  ans:
  - I had to get up anyway.

- que:
  - Where's the pinto going?
  ans:
  - I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.

- que:
  - Where's Turley?
  ans:
  - South of here, past Chimayo.

- que:
  - Going to Turley, was it?
  ans:
  - Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.

- que:
  - What's Turley like?
  ans:
  - It's a town...

- que:
  - They got a saloon there?
  ans:
  - I expect.

- que:
  - Women?
  ans:
  - I expect.

- que:
  - Which way do you mean?
  ans:
  - Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.

- que:
  - Where you been?
  ans:
  - Oh, I was just checking the, ah... ...you know, lookin' in.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.

- que:
  - Daddy?
  ans:
  - I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.

- que:
  - Where is Rae?
  ans:
  - She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.

- que:
  - What about the law?
  ans:
  - Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because they don't like what I want.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.

- que:
  - You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
  ans:
  - We didn't get that far.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - We wait.

- que:
  - Where's your brother?
  ans:
  - He'll be here.

- que:
  - This a friend of yours?
  ans:
  - He is now.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - Oh, a guy who got run out of town...

- que:
  - What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
  ans:
  - I don't want you getting anyone in my place.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm done talking. Get out.

- que:
  - There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them. Are these your friends?
  ans:
  - I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.

- que:
  - Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
  ans:
  - You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.

- que:
  - What's all this then?
  ans:
  - This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.

- que:
  - Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
  ans:
  - Don't press your luck, Carter.

- que:
  - So this is the guy you're going to hang?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.

- que:
  - Who did it?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.

- que:
  - Why come to me?
  ans:
  - Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.

- que:
  - What's stopping you?
  ans:
  - They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.

- que:
  - Why would they stop you?
  ans:
  - Because I'm your sister.

- que:
  - Shut up. You need help, don't you?
  ans:
  - This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.

- que:
  - Why are they doing this, Mal?
  ans:
  - Because they enjoy it.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - I got there just short of too late.

- que:
  - Where's Emmett now?
  ans:
  - He must be pretty good.

- que:
  - What about his brother?
  ans:
  - We'll handle that. He's careless.

- que:
  - Did you hear his son is still around?
  ans:
  - Hello, Cobb.

- que:
  - Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
  ans:
  - I see you're prospering without me.

- que:
  - Where's the dog?
  ans:
  - Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.

- que:
  - You got a place to stay?
  ans:
  - I just got to town.

- que:
  - What brings you into my saloon?
  ans:
  - Luck, I guess.

- que:
  - What is it you want from me?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.

- que:
  - So we understand each other?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.

- que:
  - What's she got to do with it?
  ans:
  - Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend. But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.

- que:
  - I run the place. What can I get you?
  ans:
  - Nifty.

- que:
  - Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
  ans:
  - I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.

- que:
  - You like a good saloon?
  ans:
  - It's the only place I'm happy.

- que:
  - You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
  ans:
  - That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.

- que:
  - So-called?
  ans:
  - Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.

- que:
  - Why'd you go into business with him?
  ans:
  - I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.

- que:
  - Who's the owner?
  ans:
  - Here he comes right now.

- que:
  - Is this a fair mix?
  ans:
  - I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - That's the good stuff.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? How good?
  ans:
  - You really are a gambler.

- que:
  - Where's the dog now?
  ans:
  - He left me.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.

- que:
  - How about you?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to get hurt.

- que:
  - A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. The fan club is real. But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.

- que:
  - Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
  ans:
  - It wasn't her body. It was her body of work.

- que:
  - My God, are you alright, Simone?
  ans:
  - Exactly. You're a household name now. You're moving in entirely different worlds. That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.

- que:
  - God, Viktor. Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
  ans:
  - Difficult. I'm difficult.

- que:
  - -- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
  ans:
  - Hmm... Mike and Ike's.

- que:
  - -- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
  ans:
  - -- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.

- que:
  - -- What's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - The public decides who's on that list.

- que:
  - So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
  ans:
  - They're yours. But how are you going to finish it? Without a star there's no movie.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Good to see you too, Elaine.

- que:
  - Why isn't she with you?
  ans:
  - Why? Because she would never show up at something like this. She's intensely private.

- que:
  - Don't thank me. It was entirely Simone's decision. Do you have Simone's check?
  ans:
  - Almost right.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - As I say, she's... something of a recluse. That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.

- que:
  - Out of the question. A circus like that?
  ans:
  - Viktor, it's my studio.

- que:
  - There aren't any. If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy. She considers herself an... \"instrument\".
  ans:
  - No problem. Do you want to come in?

- que:
  - Really? Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
  ans:
  - If it's on the page...

- que:
  - Hair and make-up?
  ans:
  - She'll do her own. Theater training.

- que:
  - She was in the theater? When? Where?
  ans:
  - I'll send you her resume.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - There isn't one.

- que:
  - Even the fall from the plane?
  ans:
  - Even the fall from the plane.

- que:
  - Which accounts for your percentage. When do I get to meet this dream?
  ans:
  - Not today. She's learning her lines. You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.

- que:
  - Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
  ans:
  - Simone does not control my destiny.

- que:
  - Thank you. What did you think, Lainey?
  ans:
  - I got them to remove the reflection. The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.

- que:
  - That's genius, Viktor. Was that Simone's idea?
  ans:
  - Who else? It's always Simone's idea.

- que:
  - You really think so?
  ans:
  - Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it.

- que:
  - I'd love to tell her myself. When are you going to let me meet her?
  ans:
  - Soon. Soon.

- que:
  - She was there. She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
  ans:
  - She said you were very beautiful.

- que:
  - -- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No, of course not! Why? Would you care if we were?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.

- que:
  - I do?
  ans:
  - Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.

- que:
  - Excuse me? Start?
  ans:
  - It's a crowded summer. We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night, Viktor.

- que:
  - About now. Would you like a drink?
  ans:
  - I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.

- que:
  - Is Simone back to earth yet?
  ans:
  - Not quite.

- que:
  - I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor. Is she really having your baby?
  ans:
  - Impossible.

- que:
  - This is crazy. Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone. What woman can?
  ans:
  - I would rather have you than Simone. Believe me.

- que:
  - Oh, Viktor. You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this. But in the morning, you'd go back to her. What man wouldn't?
  ans:
  - No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.

- que:
  - How can you bring that up at a time like this?
  ans:
  - Thank you! I don't know how you did it but thank you.

- que:
  - Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
  ans:
  - Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.

- que:
  - That sounds wonderful. How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
  ans:
  - Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's not a death sentence.

- que:
  - Hello, is this Elaine?
  ans:
  - Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I've been wanting to talk to you.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor's car.

- que:
  - Mom, do you miss Dad?
  ans:
  - Thank Simone for the tickets.

- que:
  - Because obviously she existed, right?
  ans:
  - I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.

- que:
  - Of course. What are you suggesting?
  ans:
  - I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.

- que:
  - Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
  ans:
  - Well, I --

- que:
  - Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
  ans:
  - You had no choice, Elaine. He's a liability.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Obviously, this can't last. She's going to dump him. Viktor won't be able to take that. He's too sensitive. It'll destroy him.

- que:
  - Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
  ans:
  - I have to talk to her.

- que:
  - No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky. How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
  ans:
  - You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er... ... scent.

- que:
  - ... so much like her?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.

- que:
  - What?... What did you say?
  ans:
  - Do what you do to Simone.

- que:
  - What I do to Simone?
  ans:
  - Yes, call me Simone.

- que:
  - Simone?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes, again, again. Do what you do to Simone. I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.

- que:
  - Is that a problem?
  ans:
  - Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.

- que:
  - Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
  ans:
  - Who are you really?

- que:
  - How about the nudity?
  ans:
  - Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank. For me, clothes are just an option.

- que:
  - What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
  ans:
  - I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.

- que:
  - And what may I ask brought this on?
  ans:
  - Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.

- que:
  - How will you do our love scenes?
  ans:
  - Body double.

- que:
  - You can't.
  ans:
  - Hal, what are you doing?

- que:
  - -- No. No. A real wall. You ran right through it.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - How did the wall get there?
  ans:
  - I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together. Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago. Let's move on.

- que:
  - I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
  ans:
  - Somebody said she was here.

- que:
  - You want me to call Security?
  ans:
  - -- We call them \"vactors\".

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - An eye -- for performance. You know the truth when you see it. I know. I've seen your movies. I love your movies.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - \"Straw God\" changed my life.

- que:
  - You saw that?
  ans:
  - Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day. I'll call you about his next week.

- que:
  - 2 Harry! Harry! Can we have a minute? What brings you here tonight?
  ans:
  - I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.

- que:
  - 2 There's a rumor that you're more than just \"good friends\"?
  ans:
  - We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.

- que:
  - Don't feel too bad. Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her. You're better off out of it.
  ans:
  - 2 Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?

- que:
  - You look very grown up. What are you doing? You meeting your mom for dinner?
  ans:
  - I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart. It's important.

- que:
  - Your mother couldn't make it?
  ans:
  - She's at the premiere of \"A Cold Day In Hell\". But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.

- que:
  - She still with Kent?
  ans:
  - There was no other way.

- que:
  - Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
  ans:
  - You know, I... don't know.

- que:
  - Is she here tonight?
  ans:
  - She can't watch herself.

- que:
  - I saw her picture on the, er... internet. You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
  ans:
  - Only her brilliance. To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck. You really pulled it off.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I know plenty of boys.

- que:
  - Really? Who? Where do you meet them? In a chat room? How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
  ans:
  - Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I read.

- que:
  - Exactly. Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.

- que:
  - So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
  ans:
  - Precisely.

- que:
  - I do okay. How about you?
  ans:
  - You know me -- married to my work.

- que:
  - Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A phone call?
  ans:
  - Too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.

- que:
  - I'll see what I can do. You know, Lainey. I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone. Don't you like her?
  ans:
  - I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.

- que:
  - Happy birthday, Lainey. Do you like it?
  ans:
  - It's fantastic -- it's too much.

- que:
  - Why not? I can get you something else. What do you want?
  ans:
  - No, that was me.

- que:
  - About you and mom?
  ans:
  - Max Sayer -- National Echo.

- que:
  - Don't you have a real story to write? Why aren't you in Latin America?
  ans:
  - This is the story.

- que:
  - She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky. Are you holding her hostage? Are you some kind of Svengali?
  ans:
  - I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed. It gets cold out here at night.

- que:
  - What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
  ans:
  - I want to see her. Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.

- que:
  - What now, Sayer?
  ans:
  - Looks familiar, doesn't she? No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...

- que:
  - Don't you?
  ans:
  - This should take care of Mother.

- que:
  - Is it a jamming device?
  ans:
  - Maybe he's talking to himself.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Whatever it is, it's dark.

- que:
  - Dark?
  ans:
  - Yes, very.

- que:
  - 24-hour tail on Taransky?
  ans:
  - Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take. But this Simone woman is good.

- que:
  - My God, you've got one?
  ans:
  - I will when you're finished writing it.

- que:
  - Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
  ans:
  - We used to.

- que:
  - Is that why she left you?
  ans:
  - It's a hotel.

- que:
  - -- Nicola! How was your massage?
  ans:
  - It's the biggest on earth! I swear! It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.

- que:
  - Taller? What?
  ans:
  - I beg you. You can't do this to me.

- que:
  - Would you like me to read?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'd like that.

- que:
  - You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
  ans:
  - No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.

- que:
  - What if it catches on fire?
  ans:
  - Let it burn. Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
  ans:
  - I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.

- que:
  - Simone, are you there?
  ans:
  - I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.

- que:
  - VIKTOR You mean they buy it?
  ans:
  - Buy it? They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.

- que:
  - VIKTOR Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes, it is.

- que:
  - VIKTOR Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
  ans:
  - The only real truth is in the work.

- que:
  - Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
  ans:
  - Wow. They called you their son.

- que:
  - Why did you leave me?
  ans:
  - I didn't leave you.

- que:
  - All your soldiers speak Latin?
  ans:
  - No, just one.

- que:
  - What were they hiding from?
  ans:
  - Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.

- que:
  - Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
  ans:
  - I forgot your name.

- que:
  - You're a doctor. What kind?
  ans:
  - I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.

- que:
  - You use needles?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - If it's okay with you?
  ans:
  - And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.

- que:
  - You saw that on T.V., Cole?
  ans:
  - Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying. I don't draw like that anymore.

- que:
  - How do you draw now?
  ans:
  - I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows. They don't have meetings about rainbows.

- que:
  - You want to ask me a question?
  ans:
  - See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.

- que:
  - Where should I look then, Cole?
  ans:
  - Look over there.

- que:
  - He your best buddy?
  ans:
  - He hates me.

- que:
  - You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
  ans:
  - I don't tell her a thing.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.

- que:
  - Know what?
  ans:
  - That I'm a freak.

- que:
  - What about Mrs. Marschal?
  ans:
  - She died a long time ago.

- que:
  - What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.

- que:
  - What'd you write?
  ans:
  - Words.

- que:
  - What kind of words?
  ans:
  - Upset words.

- que:
  - If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
  ans:
  - That isn't magic.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...

- que:
  - Who me?
  ans:
  - I didn't know you were funny.

- que:
  - Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You haven't told bedtime stories before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What makes you think that?
  ans:
  - Your eyes told me.

- que:
  - Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
  ans:
  - No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.

- que:
  - All the time. They're everywhere. You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
  ans:
  - ...No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.

- que:
  - Cats?
  ans:
  - Never mind.

- que:
  - And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
  ans:
  - When they get mad, it gets cold.

- que:
  - Can I ask you then?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do you want more than anything?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why don't you think about it for a while?
  ans:
  - I have to.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Soon. One week.

- que:
  - --What?
  ans:
  - Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.

- que:
  - Dr. Crowe?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Something happened, didn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, it did.

- que:
  - Are you wigging out?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am.

- que:
  - We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
  ans:
  - No, we're not.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - You really look better.

- que:
  - It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.' Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You believe now?
  ans:
  - I believe both of you now. And I think I might know how to make them go away.

- que:
  - What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
  ans:
  - I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.

- que:
  - She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
  ans:
  - I guess she did.

- que:
  - Don't go home, okay?
  ans:
  - I definitely won't.

- que:
  - I think we said everything we needed to say. Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

- que:
  - What are you thinking, Momma?
  ans:
  - Lots of things.

- que:
  - Anything bad about me?
  ans:
  - It was Grandma's. It's not for playing. What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.

- que:
  - That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.

- que:
  - You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
  ans:
  - Don't get mad.

- que:
  - So who moved it?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Communicate?
  ans:
  - Tell you my secrets.

- que:
  - You know that accident up there?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - They did?
  ans:
  - A lady. She died.

- que:
  - You can see her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Standing next to my window.

- que:
  - They?
  ans:
  - Dead people.

- que:
  - Dead people?
  ans:
  - Ghosts.

- que:
  - You see ghosts, Cole?
  ans:
  - They want me to do things for them.

- que:
  - What are you thinking, Momma?
  ans:
  - ...I don't know.

- que:
  - I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

- que:
  - Yes, Cole?
  ans:
  - They used to hang people here.

- que:
  - That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
  ans:
  - They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.

- que:
  - You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
  ans:
  - Like what?

- que:
  - How did you--?
  ans:
  - Stop looking at me.

- que:
  - Chuck E. who?
  ans:
  - Cheese. It's a kid's place.

- que:
  - J. C. Penny's?
  ans:
  - Good for you.

- que:
  - How'd he know I'd come?
  ans:
  - Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Course, it's none of my business.

- que:
  - You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
  ans:
  - Superstition.

- que:
  - ...Chicken blood? Who said it was... \"chicken blood\"?
  ans:
  - I'd watch your step if I were you, son.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Why's that?
  ans:
  - You're standing in horseshit.

- que:
  - Yo. \"Billy Bob\". Was I two beats behind, or what?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - See?
  ans:
  - You were a beat and a quarter behind.

- que:
  - Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
  ans:
  - I ain't never played a banjo in my life.

- que:
  - Get off his case sweetie.
  ans:
  - Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?

- que:
  - Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
  ans:
  - Fuck you.

- que:
  - Someone actually... employs you?
  ans:
  - I happen to be a professional.

- que:
  - Which street corner?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - ...You any good with those?
  ans:
  - You have a strong unfufilled desire.

- que:
  - Hey, isn't that the preacher?
  ans:
  - Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.

- que:
  - You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
  ans:
  - Not someone -- Mac.

- que:
  - Carl, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.

- que:
  - Hey. Fuck you.
  ans:
  - You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?

- que:
  - Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
  ans:
  - Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.

- que:
  - Curt Cobain.
  ans:
  - Two hundred bucks? Are you crazy?

- que:
  - Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
  ans:
  - Well, there goes our record deal.

- que:
  - Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
  ans:
  - The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.

- que:
  - Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.

- que:
  - So... what does it do?
  ans:
  - It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.

- que:
  - Should we be doing this, dude?
  ans:
  - That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.

- que:
  - Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
  ans:
  - I'll be fine here.

- que:
  - Amends...?
  ans:
  - Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.

- que:
  - I'm admiring your costume. What \"movie\" are you going as again?
  ans:
  - Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

- que:
  - Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
  ans:
  - You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.

- que:
  - Amen.
  ans:
  - You got something against farm people, Keith?

- que:
  - What the fuck you talking about, man?
  ans:
  - You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - -- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Name something.

- que:
  - Then why go back now?
  ans:
  - Still trying to figure it out myself.

- que:
  - What about Jeremiah?
  ans:
  - Nah. Just you.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.

- que:
  - Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
  ans:
  - Getting ready.

- que:
  - Look. You want to talk about this?
  ans:
  - You're... limping.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like your guitar break.

- que:
  - -- Where have you two been?
  ans:
  - Us? We been... moonlighting.

- que:
  - Where's Mac?
  ans:
  - Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.

- que:
  - Why bother?
  ans:
  - It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.

- que:
  - What'll we do?
  ans:
  - Bill, you're Chief of police now.

- que:
  - How are you going to find him?
  ans:
  - Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.

- que:
  - Sorry.
  ans:
  - And that makes you look like a squid?

- que:
  - Whatcha' doin'?
  ans:
  - Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.

- que:
  - What you up to?
  ans:
  - Just checking out the lights.

- que:
  - Pretty, ain't they?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.

- que:
  - Grant, where'd you go?
  ans:
  - Hey, Grant.

- que:
  - No. What?
  ans:
  - She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.

- que:
  - How about Brenda?
  ans:
  - New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.

- que:
  - I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
  ans:
  - Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.

- que:
  - Yeah. Good.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
  ans:
  - Aspirin.

- que:
  - We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What's she see in that douchebag?
  ans:
  - He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.

- que:
  - Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
  ans:
  - And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.

- que:
  - Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
  ans:
  - I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.

- que:
  - You dig that rat out of the hole?
  ans:
  - Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.

- que:
  - Where's the old half--Mexican?
  ans:
  - Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.

- que:
  - Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
  ans:
  - Sure thing, killer.

- que:
  - What can I do you for?
  ans:
  - Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.

- que:
  - All the rib eyes?
  ans:
  - Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...

- que:
  - That's not true -- Where are you--?
  ans:
  - Out.

- que:
  - Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
  ans:
  - Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.

- que:
  - You're my princess, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - You're pretty.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - It's just one of my students, Grant.

- que:
  - Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
  ans:
  - I'll get if for you.

- que:
  - What other stuff?
  ans:
  - Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.

- que:
  - And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
  ans:
  - When one sees you they all see you.

- que:
  - Gold--digger, huh?
  ans:
  - We ain't never gonna find that girl now.

- que:
  - Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.

- que:
  - If...?
  ans:
  - I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.

- que:
  - America's bored. Now, what do you want?
  ans:
  - You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - All sound reasons for matrimony.

- que:
  - Why're you driving so fast?
  ans:
  - I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.

- que:
  - Why? You have a bowling date?
  ans:
  - Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.

- que:
  - Who'd want to?
  ans:
  - I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
  ans:
  - For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.

- que:
  - But you could get killed, right?
  ans:
  - Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - Eyes on the road.

- que:
  - No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
  ans:
  - Having fun.

- que:
  - Driving?
  ans:
  - Driving, talking to me...

- que:
  - Where you from?
  ans:
  - Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.

- que:
  - Guess what?
  ans:
  - I give up.

- que:
  - What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Shoot.

- que:
  - What do you want to be when you grow up?
  ans:
  - You know, you're not a bad driver.

- que:
  - That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - We lost him.

- que:
  - The bus'll pick you up over there. Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
  ans:
  - Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time. Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.

- que:
  - You know this guy, don't you?
  ans:
  - I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.

- que:
  - By stealing my car?
  ans:
  - I would've come back for you.

- que:
  - You want to lose this putz or not?!?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.

- que:
  - You plan on driving trucks all your life?
  ans:
  - No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.

- que:
  - You plan on driving trucks all your life?
  ans:
  - I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.

- que:
  - Then let's change the subject. What do you think about forced school busing?
  ans:
  - An unmarked police car.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I know. Bandit two, bring yourself on in.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.

- que:
  - Ummm?
  ans:
  - Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.

- que:
  - Bandit II?
  ans:
  - -- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.

- que:
  - What kind of a guy is he?
  ans:
  - The minute you see him, you'll know.

- que:
  - Why are you stopping?
  ans:
  - Weight Station.

- que:
  - One to five?
  ans:
  - Maybe six months with good behavior. One to five.

- que:
  - What can I say?
  ans:
  - Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.

- que:
  - I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - You gotta admire the man's determination.

- que:
  - Why should I?
  ans:
  - Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - But you'll do it?
  ans:
  - I'll do it.

- que:
  - What's your pleasure?
  ans:
  - Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...

- que:
  - No what?
  ans:
  - Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.

- que:
  - Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
  ans:
  - Another time.

- que:
  - How'd you know?
  ans:
  - Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.

- que:
  - You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
  ans:
  - Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?

- que:
  - Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I don't know, man. Ask him?
  ans:
  - We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.

- que:
  - What are you doin' now?
  ans:
  - Running blocker.

- que:
  - Why are we doing this?
  ans:
  - Because they said it couldn't be done.

- que:
  - Let's get the hell outta here.
  ans:
  - You know how to drive one of these things?

- que:
  - Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
  ans:
  - Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.

- que:
  - We still on schedule?
  ans:
  - Forty-two minutes ahead.

- que:
  - Bandit I, do you copy?
  ans:
  - This is Bandit I, come back.

- que:
  - On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
  ans:
  - Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.

- que:
  - What's your twenty?
  ans:
  - I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.

- que:
  - What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
  ans:
  - If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.

- que:
  - What does the old Timex say?
  ans:
  - She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.

- que:
  - Yeah, guy?
  ans:
  - Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.

- que:
  - What's your twenty?
  ans:
  - Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.

- que:
  - Just don't worry about it. How we doin' timewise?
  ans:
  - Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.

- que:
  - Bandit?
  ans:
  - Never mind. It's nothing.

- que:
  - Anything else you don't want me to know?
  ans:
  - Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - We're outta motion lotion.

- que:
  - Just fine. What's the weather like?
  ans:
  - God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.

- que:
  - -- How we doing?
  ans:
  - It's gonna be close. Real close.

- que:
  - Bandit II?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - What's that, pardner?
  ans:
  - Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.

- que:
  - When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
  ans:
  - But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.

- que:
  - What's your twenty and what's your handle?
  ans:
  - My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.

- que:
  - What else? Can you give me cover, Mister B?
  ans:
  - It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.

- que:
  - Seventy-two five. Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
  ans:
  - He's thirsty.

- que:
  - Have any trouble getting here?
  ans:
  - About one to five years worth.

- que:
  - Uh-uh. What Cobra?
  ans:
  - Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.

- que:
  - Where the hell are you?
  ans:
  - Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...

- que:
  - Who's Fred?
  ans:
  - Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.

- que:
  - Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
  ans:
  - That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.

- que:
  - Bandit two, you read me?
  ans:
  - You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.

- que:
  - Is that Bandit in the lead?
  ans:
  - If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.

- que:
  - Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
  ans:
  - Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

- que:
  - But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
  ans:
  - That's the point, Dickey.

- que:
  - -- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
  ans:
  - -- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.

- que:
  - -- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
  ans:
  - -- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.

- que:
  - So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
  ans:
  - That's correct.

- que:
  - -- so you shut them off?
  ans:
  - Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.

- que:
  - What kind of personnel?
  ans:
  - Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.

- que:
  - Is your security team armed?
  ans:
  - Of course. Yes.

- que:
  - Anything on the Swede?
  ans:
  - Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.

- que:
  - But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.

- que:
  - So he has no idea what's about to happen?
  ans:
  - No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.

- que:
  - He's giving them up?
  ans:
  - All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.

- que:
  - Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
  ans:
  - That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.

- que:
  - Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
  ans:
  - No. I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.

- que:
  - -- he was wearing one of our jackets.
  ans:
  - Wait a minute, what other agent? What other agent?

- que:
  - This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said \"FBI\" on it.

- que:
  - You investigating those murders out at the lake?
  ans:
  - Ww... uh...

- que:
  - And this is your car, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Mmm-hmm.

- que:
  - But there were more of you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.

- que:
  - Two of 'em?
  ans:
  - Thass' right. I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.

- que:
  - You woulda?
  ans:
  - Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.

- que:
  - Are you on a land line?
  ans:
  - Yeah, why.

- que:
  - ...About what?
  ans:
  - About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.

- que:
  - -- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I? Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
  ans:
  - Your attitude sucks.

- que:
  - I been accused of worse. What do we got...?
  ans:
  - I got his machine.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - I said I got his machine.

- que:
  - No, what did you say on the machine?
  ans:
  - I left him a message.

- que:
  - Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
  ans:
  - I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Look at the collar on that coat...

- que:
  - I could have it sent out...
  ans:
  - I dunno... Cinnamon roll?

- que:
  - Do you want me to say I did it?
  ans:
  - I was kinda hoping, yeah.

- que:
  - Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
  ans:
  - Only if you really, truly mean it.

- que:
  - Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
  ans:
  - I am. Yeah.

- que:
  - Without peer?
  ans:
  - I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.

- que:
  - They what? What? No. No. Why?
  ans:
  - The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...

- que:
  - So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
  ans:
  - Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.

- que:
  - So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
  ans:
  - On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.

- que:
  - You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
  ans:
  - It's the last place they'd look.

- que:
  - This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
  ans:
  - Difficult to explain everything now... And much larger issues loom. I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.

- que:
  - You're finished.
  ans:
  - Where's Israel?

- que:
  - ...Does he know?
  ans:
  - ...He does now...

- que:
  - The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
  ans:
  - ...When did you know all this?

- que:
  - ...So you made another deal?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't go that far.

- que:
  - You're trying to save Sparazza?
  ans:
  - No... We're trying to save Heller.

- que:
  - No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
  ans:
  - Buzzy... Buzz...?

- que:
  - Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
  ans:
  - Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.

- que:
  - ... Jesus... what for?
  ans:
  - -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.

- que:
  - That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I can front this.

- que:
  - That's the punchline, y'ready?
  ans:
  - Shoot.

- que:
  - So how we lookin'?
  ans:
  - Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.

- que:
  - Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
  ans:
  - Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.

- que:
  - Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
  ans:
  - -- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.

- que:
  - My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask? You hurtin' pretty bad?
  ans:
  - Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.

- que:
  - True?
  ans:
  - Like a mafucka.

- que:
  - I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever. You gonna lemme see your scars?
  ans:
  - You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.

- que:
  - What were you doin' here anyway?
  ans:
  - Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --

- que:
  - A Fed? Like FBI?
  ans:
  - It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone. Alright, let's set this spinnin'...

- que:
  - Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
  ans:
  - ...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.

- que:
  - You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
  ans:
  - The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.

- que:
  - ...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
  ans:
  - I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.

- que:
  - What!?
  ans:
  - Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.

- que:
  - Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
  ans:
  - I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets. Plus you stank.

- que:
  - -- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
  ans:
  - What'd you say?

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Security's locking down the elevators.

- que:
  - C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps. ...Maybe spend the night?
  ans:
  - ...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.

- que:
  - Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
  ans:
  - Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...

- que:
  - What else did Padiche say?
  ans:
  - He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good. 'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.

- que:
  - What's the time frame?
  ans:
  - Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.

- que:
  - Can it work?
  ans:
  - It can. Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected. Everything else, disintegrates.

- que:
  - No? Who am I, then?
  ans:
  - A puppet.

- que:
  - Didn't you talk to Snow?
  ans:
  - I want to hear your version.

- que:
  - I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. Now, What happened to him?
  ans:
  - The same thing that could happen to any of us.

- que:
  - Where's his body?
  ans:
  - In the lab. With her, probably.

- que:
  - Her? Who are you talking about?
  ans:
  - They shouldn't let people like you into space.

- que:
  - Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No, she won't.
  ans:
  - Why did you agree to come here?

- que:
  - Why would you let her to do that?
  ans:
  - You fucking bastard...

- que:
  - Whose side are you on?
  ans:
  - It's changing characteristics. It's solidifying taking on weight.

- que:
  - How quickly?
  ans:
  - If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.

- que:
  - Where's Snow? Did you call him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's wrong? What happened to Gibarian?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I can't talk just now. I'm too tired.

- que:
  - Where's Sartorius?
  ans:
  - In his lab. He won't let you in.

- que:
  - Why, who did you see?
  ans:
  - Gibarian warned me. He left me a message.

- que:
  - She was real. Where did she come from?
  ans:
  - Tell me. I won't think you're insane.

- que:
  - How long can you go without sleep?
  ans:
  - That depends.

- que:
  - Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - Personally, I think it's God. At least, it fits my definition.

- que:
  - And professionally?
  ans:
  - My wife.

- que:
  - She has materialized from your memory of her. What was her name?
  ans:
  - Rheya.

- que:
  - Will she come back?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - What are you going to report back to Earth?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just a little strategy session. But in person this time.

- que:
  - -- we are not sure of that. We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
  ans:
  - When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?

- que:
  - If God is beyond our comprehension, and she -- -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
  ans:
  - Not necessarily.

- que:
  - Who are you trying to convince?
  ans:
  - We can liquidate the station. Take the Athena back.

- que:
  - I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now. Why now?
  ans:
  - But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything. Presented me with your double, and you with mine.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - She knows everything. She knows who she is.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.

- que:
  - What plan?
  ans:
  - Just get him to stop.

- que:
  - What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
  ans:
  - I love her.

- que:
  - When did this happen?
  ans:
  - Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I can't be alone.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - To calm your anxiety.

- que:
  - We're taking a flight?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Book?
  ans:
  - Poem. Dylan Thomas. I thought of it when I saw you on the train.

- que:
  - And tonight?
  ans:
  - Better.

- que:
  - You want to fuck her?
  ans:
  - Stop it.

- que:
  - Is it intelligent?
  ans:
  - Intelligent beyond our comprehension.

- que:
  - Then it's God, right?
  ans:
  - It's something.

- que:
  - But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
  ans:
  - As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.

- que:
  - You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
  ans:
  - When I saw you were gone I got scared.

- que:
  - Where've you been?
  ans:
  - I been thinking about how much I hate you.

- que:
  - I did too.
  ans:
  - What kind of look?

- que:
  - Why did you say those things?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.

- que:
  - Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - What does Snow think you should do?
  ans:
  - Sartorius wants to destroy it.

- que:
  - You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
  ans:
  - It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.

- que:
  - Do I really feel like... I am...?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - That I am not Rheya. That Rheya died. Killed herself. I'm different.

- que:
  - Who have you been talking to?
  ans:
  - Sartorius.

- que:
  - When? When I'm asleep?
  ans:
  - I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.

- que:
  - Why did she do it?
  ans:
  - You... she said I didn't love her.

- que:
  - Was she right?
  ans:
  - No. I love you.

- que:
  - Can you sleep?
  ans:
  - I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - If you're here.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Gibarian. He was here.

- que:
  - What's happening to us?
  ans:
  - It's all right.

- que:
  - How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?
  ans:
  - I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching.

- que:
  - What do I have to do to stop it?
  ans:
  - I want you here.

- que:
  - Who are you, then?
  ans:
  - Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine.

- que:
  - Is that really what you want?
  ans:
  - I want to stop taking those pills.

- que:
  - I can't --
  ans:
  - I have consciousness, but I am not mortal. Don't you see why I'm going crazy?

- que:
  - Am I really her?
  ans:
  - I don't know anymore. All I see is you.

- que:
  - What does it want?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Something. Anything.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - He won't.

- que:
  - Fuck me. I knew it.
  ans:
  - Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?

- que:
  - You want it coming back with us?
  ans:
  - You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions.

- que:
  - You didn't like him?
  ans:
  - Looks a little constipated to me.

- que:
  - You still writing the occasional magazine article?
  ans:
  - Occasionally.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out... is that all right?
  ans:
  - Uh...

- que:
  - Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
  ans:
  - Right. That's true.

- que:
  - Can we go then?
  ans:
  - I'm supposed to call in.

- que:
  - Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
  ans:
  - Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He thinks you're being a little careless. He made the point several times.

- que:
  - Queens... You know Queens?
  ans:
  - My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory School.

- que:
  - Are you nervous?
  ans:
  - No, Ma'am.

- que:
  - Beg pardon?
  ans:
  - Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Claire?
  ans:
  - Hmm...

- que:
  - You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
  ans:
  - Urdu and Hindi.

- que:
  - Didn't do very well, did you?
  ans:
  - Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.

- que:
  - You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
  ans:
  - They're kind of fuzzy.

- que:
  - So, this could be your last night, huh?
  ans:
  - Could be, I guess.

- que:
  - You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. Look at this.

- que:
  - And \"is\"...?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?
  ans:
  - No dog.

- que:
  - What's to like?
  ans:
  - Tell it like it is.

- que:
  - Open the door, will you?
  ans:
  - I can't open it.

- que:
  - Claire, will you calm down?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You told her?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - When can I see you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.

- que:
  - Tomorrow night. Can you come?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.

- que:
  - Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
  ans:
  - Claire...

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Pretty bad.

- que:
  - They guys treatin' you all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How long you going away for?
  ans:
  - Long enough.

- que:
  - \"For\"...?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's all over.

- que:
  - You still going away?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - You're planning to speak?
  ans:
  - Not if you don't want me to.

- que:
  - Keep what handy?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
  ans:
  - I don't know Tommy.

- que:
  - Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
  ans:
  - Too kinky.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My ass if falling.

- que:
  - Your what...?
  ans:
  - My ass is falling. It is.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.

- que:
  - Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
  ans:
  - You got no idea...

- que:
  - So how'd it go?
  ans:
  - Not great. I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.

- que:
  - Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think?
  ans:
  - I think television's a dangerous thing.

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.

- que:
  - The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
  ans:
  - Oh, some shit.

- que:
  - What shit, honey?
  ans:
  - You don't want to hear about it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I think -- she's crazy.

- que:
  - Where'd you get the tie?
  ans:
  - Bought it.

- que:
  - What did she say the down payment was?
  ans:
  - She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.

- que:
  - She took you shopping for a tie?
  ans:
  - I had to follow her to a store.

- que:
  - What's wrong with your paisley tie?
  ans:
  - Ellie, it was a formal party...

- que:
  - Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
  ans:
  - I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...

- que:
  - I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you?
  ans:
  - She bought it.

- que:
  - Coming to bed?
  ans:
  - Few minutes. Want to catch the news.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Mike, take it easy...

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - You heard me.

- que:
  - What did you do tonight?
  ans:
  - I watched TV.

- que:
  - What did you watch?
  ans:
  - I don't remember Michael, go to sleep. You don't have to make conversation with me.

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - Let me drive...

- que:
  - Was it Venza? Did you get him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about when she goes out?
  ans:
  - But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!

- que:
  - I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
  ans:
  - It should've been me...

- que:
  - Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
  ans:
  - Right behind you, T.J.

- que:
  - Who's Joey Venza?
  ans:
  - Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! I got a 'choice' at all.

- que:
  - You in this with me?
  ans:
  - Yeah! Seniority gets the day shift.

- que:
  - THING Ever shot anyone?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - ... Hard?
  ans:
  - THING Erect. You know, a \"boner?\" I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.

- que:
  - Are you in charge here?
  ans:
  - No, sir...

- que:
  - Is she injured?
  ans:
  - You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.

- que:
  - You're here 'til what time?
  ans:
  - I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.

- que:
  - Why should she come in?
  ans:
  - My special, scrambled eggs surprise.

- que:
  - How do you know where the gun is?
  ans:
  - I know where everything is.

- que:
  - Yeah, I think so.
  ans:
  - Lay back, Mack!! What's this \"lay back, Mack?\" Where does he get this?

- que:
  - How are things going, pal?
  ans:
  - Okay, I guess.

- que:
  - How about dinner tonight?
  ans:
  - Mom and I got plans.

- que:
  - She's what?
  ans:
  - She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company. He thinks she's got a great voice.

- que:
  - What! What kind of pathetic line is that?
  ans:
  - We're gonna pass the street.

- que:
  - You coming in?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not coming in. And if you'd rather go to a \"singing lesson\" than have dinner with your father...

- que:
  - So, what are you doing tonight?
  ans:
  - Shooting.

- que:
  - Shooting?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood. 'Bye, Dad.

- que:
  - And Flash isn't?
  ans:
  - Be nice.

- que:
  - Peter-- you took this picture?
  ans:
  - No. No, that's okay.

- que:
  - Same old stuff. How's the pharmacy?
  ans:
  - Ah, ya know. Neighborhood's not what it used to be. Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.

- que:
  - You stop him?
  ans:
  - Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way. Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.

- que:
  - I know. Still thinking about retiring?
  ans:
  - Eh. If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.

- que:
  - Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
  ans:
  - Nonot really.

- que:
  - Remember Little League?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.

- que:
  - Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure.

- que:
  - They'll never take me alive.
  ans:
  - See?

- que:
  - What's in there?
  ans:
  - A little bunny I saved from dissection.

- que:
  - You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
  ans:
  - Don't be pitiful.

- que:
  - That's not even close.
  ans:
  - You get mugged or something?

- que:
  - Get inside and get pictures. Fifty bucks.
  ans:
  - Are you okay?

- que:
  - Can we make it a hundred?
  ans:
  - Police, help! Po-- mmph.

- que:
  - Hmf-hrr?
  ans:
  - No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.

- que:
  - What's this? A cockaroach?
  ans:
  - A spider. Eight legs.

- que:
  - How about tomorrow?
  ans:
  - You're making my life difficult.

- que:
  - Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
  ans:
  - An even five I throw in the jacket.

- que:
  - Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
  ans:
  - Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.

- que:
  - Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
  ans:
  - Thanks, I already ate.

- que:
  - I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - All right, amazing. Are you quite finished?
  ans:
  - Just about. You see, I also have this amazing strength...

- que:
  - Are you quite finished?
  ans:
  - Just about. See, I also have this amazing strength.

- que:
  - What if the world ends tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Good morning, Liz.

- que:
  - -- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
  ans:
  - Huh?

- que:
  - Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny?
  ans:
  - Back to the lab. Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.

- que:
  - Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
  ans:
  - My my.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - God, Flash can be such a jerk.

- que:
  - But you like that in a man?
  ans:
  - You should write that one down.

- que:
  - What are you doing this weekend?
  ans:
  - Hi, Adele.

- que:
  - What's your problem?
  ans:
  - I've got no problems.

- que:
  - What's in the bag? Garbage?
  ans:
  - Sort of. I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.

- que:
  - This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
  ans:
  - That was then. I'm better since the lobotomy.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I come too?
  ans:
  - I think I'd like that.

- que:
  - You're not trained for that. None of us are... I mean, sometimes I... Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then? Are you bulletproof?
  ans:
  - Well, no.

- que:
  - You'd feel what?
  ans:
  - I know what you mean. I...

- que:
  - Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening?
  ans:
  - Unh-huh. Excuse me. I've gotta go.

- que:
  - Peter?
  ans:
  - I'm here...

- que:
  - Hello. So very boring. Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
  ans:
  - This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.

- que:
  - Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide. Any bad blood between him and Ock?
  ans:
  - I know him.

- que:
  - Yeah, Roz.
  ans:
  - It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try. Funny coincidence, huh?

- que:
  - Aunt May, you're trespassing.
  ans:
  - Any sign of our friend?

- que:
  - It's Friday night...
  ans:
  - Your records are older than you are. Have you never heard of new wave?

- que:
  - Yes. Do you have a date?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - Tofu. Ben, I wish you wouldn't.

- que:
  - Aunt May, what happened?
  ans:
  - I was napping on the couch. There was a voice and a shot. I woke up. Ben was looking at me.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.

- que:
  - You're wrong. Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
  ans:
  - Is this some sort of Zen thing?

- que:
  - Creation? Or its opposite?
  ans:
  - Truth. Pure, eternal. Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.

- que:
  - Peter, what can I do for you?
  ans:
  - An extension on that astronomy paper? Because, uh...

- que:
  - Not a lot. I saw inside of the Science Center. What exactly happened?
  ans:
  - Only Octavius knows for sure. And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.

- que:
  - Need any more help?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. I'm sure you've got your own problems.

- que:
  - Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then. Bye.
  ans:
  - Kid, you were terrific. Max Reiss, novelty acts. Was that judo or something? Ah, skip it. Question is, can you do it again?

- que:
  - Like it?
  ans:
  - Nah. The big mask was better.

- que:
  - So they're airing this tonight?
  ans:
  - Yup. Oh, here's your check, minus my commission. Solid, solid novelty act.

- que:
  - I sent for the police. We can explain.
  ans:
  - ... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?

- que:
  - Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
  ans:
  - Right. Let's go.

- que:
  - The usual. Heredity and environment. What's the deal with Doc Ock?
  ans:
  - He'll try to finish his experiment.

- que:
  - And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it?
  ans:
  - A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.

- que:
  - Do you... live around here?
  ans:
  - No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.

- que:
  - They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
  ans:
  - Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?

- que:
  - What's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - Plenty.

- que:
  - How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
  ans:
  - You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.

- que:
  - Is you all good Nazis?
  ans:
  - Jawohl.

- que:
  - We made a deal with Barrack One.
  ans:
  - Is you all little Adolfs?

- que:
  - Any news on Dunbar?
  ans:
  - He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.

- que:
  - Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
  ans:
  - Roger.

- que:
  - Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire. Here's the wire cutters. Are the civilian clothes ready?
  ans:
  - Coming up.

- que:
  - W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
  ans:
  - That'll do.

- que:
  - What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
  ans:
  - I don't know anymore.

- que:
  - In this barracks?
  ans:
  - Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.

- que:
  - If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Security.

- que:
  - Now what kind of a crack is that?
  ans:
  - No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.

- que:
  - Anybody here wanna double their bet?
  ans:
  - Private property, bub.

- que:
  - Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it, what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
  ans:
  - Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.

- que:
  - Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Ask Security. You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
  ans:
  - I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.

- que:
  - A little something what?
  ans:
  - Yeah, what about it? Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.

- que:
  - Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
  ans:
  - You make my mouth water.

- que:
  - What are you looking at him for? Any objections, Sefton?
  ans:
  - Take it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Have a cigar.

- que:
  - No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
  ans:
  - Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.

- que:
  - How much more do we have to take from him?
  ans:
  - There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.

- que:
  - How did he get over there?
  ans:
  - Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.

- que:
  - Then we're all in on it?
  ans:
  - Everybody but Joey, and you know who.

- que:
  - Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
  ans:
  - Tipping me off? I do not understand.

- que:
  - Which one of you is what?
  ans:
  - Twenty-five.

- que:
  - What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
  ans:
  - Not you.

- que:
  - What some brandy?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What are the chances busting out of here?
  ans:
  - We'll know in forty seconds. Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.

- que:
  - What is your number?
  ans:
  - 105-353.

- que:
  - I'm okay here. Why bother?
  ans:
  - No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.

- que:
  - I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
  ans:
  - Ever try forty sleeping pills?

- que:
  - Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
  ans:
  - I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

- que:
  - What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
  ans:
  - The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.

- que:
  - I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
  ans:
  - It is.

- que:
  - What exactly is he charged with?
  ans:
  - Interesting.

- que:
  - Isn't it?
  ans:
  - Jawohl.

- que:
  - What is this? This is water?
  ans:
  - It's a mouse trap.

- que:
  - Me? What if she don't want me?
  ans:
  - If she don't want you, she don't get anything.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.

- que:
  - Thanks. You're a real pal! What're we goin' to do with it?
  ans:
  - Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.

- que:
  - It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
  ans:
  - You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.

- que:
  - What do they always say?
  ans:
  - That's what I wanna hear.

- que:
  - You hold him. I'll slug him.
  ans:
  - Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?

- que:
  - Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
  ans:
  - Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.

- que:
  - Let me do it, Hoffy.
  ans:
  - There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?

- que:
  - You want to go?
  ans:
  - No. I want to draw.

- que:
  - Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
  ans:
  - As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.

- que:
  - Good evening, Sergeants. A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - ...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. We have some rights here. Why is this man being taken out?
  ans:
  - Curtains would do wonders for this barrack. You will not get them.

- que:
  - Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
  ans:
  - And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.

- que:
  - Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
  ans:
  - Good.

- que:
  - What about Schulz?
  ans:
  - We'll take care of Schulz. Come on.

- que:
  - Any objections, men?
  ans:
  - What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.

- que:
  - Why the south latrine?
  ans:
  - Because that's where he is. In the water tank.

- que:
  - What radio?
  ans:
  - The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.

- que:
  - A little weak today.
  ans:
  - Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?

- que:
  - Are we boring you?
  ans:
  - What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.

- que:
  - Says who?
  ans:
  - Says me.

- que:
  - With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
  ans:
  - Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.

- que:
  - What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
  ans:
  - I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.

- que:
  - What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
  ans:
  - We did it.

- que:
  - You heard that, Sefton?
  ans:
  - Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.

- que:
  - So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
  ans:
  - Okay, Price. You stay.

- que:
  - How do they know?
  ans:
  - You told them, Hoffy.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. Fell right on my head. Sprechen sie deutsch?
  ans:
  - Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas. Let's have that civilian stuff.

- que:
  - You taking Dunbar?
  ans:
  - You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.

- que:
  - Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
  ans:
  - What's the decoy?

- que:
  - Nothing for Kuzawa?
  ans:
  - Shapiro. Shapiro.

- que:
  - Give this to Joey, will you?
  ans:
  - Oh.

- que:
  - Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
  ans:
  - I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.

- que:
  - And what's that crack supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.

- que:
  - What about the radio?
  ans:
  - Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.

- que:
  - I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
  ans:
  - Thirty-fifth.

- que:
  - Are you questioning me?
  ans:
  - Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.

- que:
  - Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
  ans:
  - The Germans know where Dunbar is.

- que:
  - I'll kill you for that!
  ans:
  - December seventh, forty-one.

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - Six o'clock. I was having dinner.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.

- que:
  - Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
  ans:
  - Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.

- que:
  - All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
  ans:
  - Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?

- que:
  - Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
  ans:
  - Ich weiss alles.

- que:
  - Wie hat er's gemacht?
  ans:
  - Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...

- que:
  - You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can -- Silk stockings?
  ans:
  - Not particularly.

- que:
  - Russian women prisoners?
  ans:
  - Yeah. We were just passing out guns.

- que:
  - Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
  ans:
  - That is my wife.

- que:
  - Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
  ans:
  - From a chicken, bug-wit.

- que:
  - Is it all right if we smell it?
  ans:
  - Just don't drool on it.

- que:
  - That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
  ans:
  - What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.

- que:
  - So you're stuck with me, eh?
  ans:
  - Maybe those Russian dames would take him.

- que:
  - You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
  ans:
  - Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - I thought he was the Chief Engineer.

- que:
  - Data?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect. I believe it was fear.

- que:
  - But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?
  ans:
  - This is its current position.

- que:
  - Courage is an emotion too, Data. Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
  ans:
  - I believe so.

- que:
  - Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
  ans:
  - I believe so.

- que:
  - He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.

- que:
  - Are any of them inhabited?
  ans:
  - Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.

- que:
  - Population?
  ans:
  - Approximately two hundred thirty million.

- que:
  - Is she still angry?
  ans:
  - No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.

- que:
  - Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
  ans:
  - It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.

- que:
  - But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
  ans:
  - Agreed.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.

- que:
  - Really? What do you feel?
  ans:
  - I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.

- que:
  - Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
  ans:
  - I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.

- que:
  - Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
  ans:
  - The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance, three light years.

- que:
  - Do you remember him?
  ans:
  - Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.

- que:
  - Your \"sixth sense\"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?
  ans:
  - Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.

- que:
  - Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
  ans:
  - You're in the Nexus.

- que:
  - This is the Nexus?
  ans:
  - For you. This is where you wanted to be.

- que:
  - Soran?
  ans:
  - All of us.

- que:
  - Where is he now?
  ans:
  - Wherever he wanted to be.

- que:
  - Yes, where would you go?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
  ans:
  - I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.

- que:
  - Well, may we have a look around?
  ans:
  - Please, please.

- que:
  - You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
  ans:
  - It won't be installed until Tuesday. Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.

- que:
  - Beautiful day, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes, it is.

- que:
  - Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you. Something's missing.
  ans:
  - So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?

- que:
  - No, no, it's not. It's better.
  ans:
  - You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?

- que:
  - Better?
  ans:
  - This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.

- que:
  - Antonia?
  ans:
  - She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.

- que:
  - Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Close to retirement?
  ans:
  - I hadn't planned on it.

- que:
  - How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
  ans:
  - You could say that.

- que:
  - Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
  ans:
  - Yes. Thank you.

- que:
  - Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
  ans:
  - It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.

- que:
  - An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
  ans:
  - Phasing? To where?

- que:
  - A photon torpedo?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - Where are the deflector relays?
  ans:
  - Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.

- que:
  - I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
  ans:
  - I was ordered to by the Captain.

- que:
  - What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
  ans:
  - Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
  ans:
  - Well, now that we're all aboard=8A Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Make it so.

- que:
  - There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
  ans:
  - We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.

- que:
  - Is there a problem?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Sir, is there anything wrong?
  ans:
  - No. Thank you.

- que:
  - How is that possible?
  ans:
  - Maybe they're not out there.

- que:
  - Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
  ans:
  - I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.

- que:
  - Captain, are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.

- que:
  - Counselor. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.

- que:
  - Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
  ans:
  - You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.

- que:
  - Doctor Soran?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.

- que:
  - What if I told you I found a new truth?
  ans:
  - The Nexus.

- que:
  - Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
  ans:
  - The royal...studs?

- que:
  - Trilithium?
  ans:
  - Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.

- que:
  - Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
  ans:
  - I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.

- que:
  - What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
  ans:
  - Soon, Captain... Quite soon.

- que:
  - Mr. Chekov -- ?
  ans:
  - An energy reading from 'C\" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...

- que:
  - Will we get another ship?
  ans:
  - I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.

- que:
  - Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
  ans:
  - Yes. He has a long journey ahead.

- que:
  - Response?
  ans:
  - Nothing. As before.

- que:
  - Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
  ans:
  - I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.

- que:
  - What did you see, Chekov?
  ans:
  - For an instant... A scout class vessel.

- que:
  - Scotty...?
  ans:
  - Aye sir, coding now.

- que:
  - Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
  ans:
  - Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...

- que:
  - I don't believe it...
  ans:
  - Could it be Spock's?

- que:
  - Why don't we beam it up?
  ans:
  - Not from here, no.

- que:
  - David!... What went wrong?
  ans:
  - I went wrong.

- que:
  - Underground deposit?
  ans:
  - Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Spock's burial robe.

- que:
  - Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
  ans:
  - It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.

- que:
  - It's time for total truth between us. This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - This planet is aging in surges.

- que:
  - ... How long?
  ans:
  - Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
  ans:
  - Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.

- que:
  - Do you have an explanation?
  ans:
  - Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...

- que:
  - Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
  ans:
  - Request permission to beam aboard immediately.

- que:
  - Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
  ans:
  - None that I can detect, sir.

- que:
  - Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
  ans:
  - Your reputation is secure, Scotty. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.

- que:
  - Mr. Scott?
  ans:
  - I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.

- que:
  - Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
  ans:
  - Sir...?

- que:
  - Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
  ans:
  - What's wrong?

- que:
  - Saavik... Is... David with you?
  ans:
  - Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.

- que:
  - This Vulcan -- is he alive?
  ans:
  - He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.

- que:
  - What happened...?
  ans:
  - He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.

- que:
  - What? What are you saying?
  ans:
  - The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.

- que:
  - And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
  ans:
  - . He will remain always as he is.

- que:
  - I know you... Do I not?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I know you.

- que:
  - Why would you do this...?
  ans:
  - Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.

- que:
  - Very well. Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
  ans:
  - The ship... Out of danger...?

- que:
  - ... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
  ans:
  - She's to be decommissioned.

- que:
  - The word, sir?
  ans:
  - The word is no. I am therefore going anyway.

- que:
  - Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
  ans:
  - We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.

- que:
  - What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
  ans:
  - See! That shimmering area.

- que:
  - That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
  ans:
  - I think it's an energy form, sir...

- que:
  - ... A cloaking device?
  ans:
  - About a dozen officers and men.

- que:
  - Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
  ans:
  - No, sir, no response.

- que:
  - Hmm.. Very odd. Scotty. Progress report?
  ans:
  - Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.

- que:
  - Would you look at that?
  ans:
  - My friends, the great experiment, Excelsior, ready for trial runs...

- que:
  - How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
  ans:
  - That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd stay there... They say it's exhaustion... We'll see.

- que:
  - Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
  ans:
  - Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.

- que:
  - Will you be able to handle that...?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'll have \"Mr. Adventure\" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous. All my hopes.

- que:
  - Where's Doctor McCoy?
  ans:
  - Indisposed, sir.

- que:
  - May I ask why...?
  ans:
  - There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too? Surrender your vessel!

- que:
  - But, why?
  ans:
  - Because you wish it.

- que:
  - Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
  ans:
  - Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!

- que:
  - But -- why?
  ans:
  - He would not have spoken of it openly.

- que:
  - What must I do?
  ans:
  - You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...

- que:
  - They know we would die first.
  ans:
  - What about Spock?

- que:
  - How can you tell that?
  ans:
  - My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.

- que:
  - My Lord... what are your orders?
  ans:
  - I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...

- que:
  - But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
  ans:
  - Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I... That -- is the real dishonor.

- que:
  - How is that...?
  ans:
  - A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place, the hind end of space.

- que:
  - The closet?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
  ans:
  - This isn't reality. This is fantasy.

- que:
  - Physician, heal thyself.
  ans:
  - But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?

- que:
  - That's all you have to say?
  ans:
  - I'm not a drama critic.

- que:
  - Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
  ans:
  - They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.

- que:
  - Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
  ans:
  - Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...

- que:
  - Uh -- what are they?
  ans:
  - For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.

- que:
  - Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
  ans:
  - From yourself, Admiral.

- que:
  - What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
  ans:
  - The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.

- que:
  - I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
  ans:
  - Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.

- que:
  - Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm still in the dark, How'd he know about Genesis?
  ans:
  - There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.

- que:
  - Go? Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Where they went. Saavik.

- que:
  - But what if they went -- nowhere?
  ans:
  - Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.

- que:
  - How can you think of food at a time like this?
  ans:
  - Our first order of business is survival.

- que:
  - You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
  ans:
  - Young. I feel young, Doctor.

- que:
  - En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? Has something happened? Do you read us?
  ans:
  - All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

- que:
  - Will you please be quiet! Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
  ans:
  - The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.

- que:
  - Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - ... Can't read you... repeat...

- que:
  - Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - ... taking Genesis away from us...

- que:
  - What order? Who's taking Genesis?
  ans:
  - ... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...

- que:
  - Why? Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...

- que:
  - Is that a poem?
  ans:
  - I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.

- que:
  - I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
  ans:
  - But we can't just sit here -- !

- que:
  - He left us. We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is the Reliant crew? Dead?
  ans:
  - Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...

- que:
  - Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
  ans:
  - I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.

- que:
  - Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
  ans:
  - To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.

- que:
  - I see. Helmsman?
  ans:
  - Well done, Commander.

- que:
  - I suppose I was. I poured a drink. Would you like it?
  ans:
  - No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.

- que:
  - Is that what you came here to say?
  ans:
  - Mainly. And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.

- que:
  - What are you looking at?
  ans:
  - The Admiral's son.

- que:
  - What are you looking at?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.

- que:
  - That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
  ans:
  - What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?

- que:
  - Thirty seconds...
  ans:
  - Genesis, what's that?

- que:
  - Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
  ans:
  - I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.

- que:
  - Chekov, who is this man?
  ans:
  - All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...

- que:
  - Uhura. Can't you augment?
  ans:
  - I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

- que:
  - Spock?
  ans:
  - Mr. Scott on discrete.

- que:
  - Sensors, Captain?
  ans:
  - I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.

- que:
  - Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
  ans:
  - Midshipman, you're a tiger.

- que:
  - Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
  ans:
  - Give the word, Admiral.

- que:
  - WHY?
  ans:
  - He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.

- que:
  - Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
  ans:
  - Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.

- que:
  - Meaning you can't even beam us back?
  ans:
  - Not at present.

- que:
  - Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
  ans:
  - Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.

- que:
  - And who is this?
  ans:
  - Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.

- que:
  - Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
  ans:
  - Yes, SIR.

- que:
  - I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
  ans:
  - I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.

- que:
  - Is the word given?
  ans:
  - The word is given, warp speed.

- que:
  - It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
  ans:
  - None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.

- que:
  - The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
  ans:
  - Home.

- que:
  - Permission to come aboard, Captain?
  ans:
  - Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.

- que:
  - Will you accompany me to the bridge?
  ans:
  - I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.

- que:
  - How far?
  ans:
  - Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.

- que:
  - Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
  ans:
  - It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.

- que:
  - WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And why?
  ans:
  - One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.

- que:
  - Who the hell are they?
  ans:
  - Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

- que:
  - The prefix code?
  ans:
  - It's all we've got.

- que:
  - ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
  ans:
  - Regula is class \"D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.

- que:
  - Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
  ans:
  - All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

- que:
  - What IS working around here?
  ans:
  - Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - Best we could do in two hours.

- que:
  - Scotty, can we make it inside?
  ans:
  - I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.

- que:
  - He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
  ans:
  - He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...

- que:
  - Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out. You gentleman can remain here, or...
  ans:
  - I never took the Kobayashi Maru test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?

- que:
  - Any suggestions, Admiral?
  ans:
  - Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners. Captain.

- que:
  - Permission to speak candidly, sir?
  ans:
  - Very well.

- que:
  - And why not?
  ans:
  - Because... there was no way to win.

- que:
  - A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
  ans:
  - ... No, sir. It has not.

- que:
  - How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
  ans:
  - As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.

- que:
  - Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
  ans:
  - It is still regulation, Admiral.

- que:
  - May I speak, sir?
  ans:
  - Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.

- que:
  - May I ask how you dealt with the test?
  ans:
  - Reliant's command...

- que:
  - Admiral?
  ans:
  - As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying, I like to think there always are possibilities.

- que:
  - What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

- que:
  - Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.

- que:
  - WHAT?
  ans:
  - I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking. I don't like to lose.

- que:
  - We are clear and free to navigate.
  ans:
  - Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?

- que:
  - Course heading, Captain?
  ans:
  - Prepare for warp speed.

- que:
  - What did you expect, Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - He's very human.

- que:
  - Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
  ans:
  - Never, sir.

- que:
  - Where must you go?
  ans:
  - To Earth. To offer testimony.

- que:
  - Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
  ans:
  - I would accept that as an axiom.

- que:
  - How're you doing?
  ans:
  - Fine. Just fine.

- que:
  - Gillian --
  ans:
  - Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.

- que:
  - Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
  ans:
  - He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.

- que:
  - No! No... What did you have in mind...?
  ans:
  - A moment alone, please.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It'll come back to him.

- que:
  - You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
  ans:
  - We've done it before.

- que:
  - Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
  ans:
  - Would you prefer to do nothing?

- que:
  - What did you say she was getting?
  ans:
  - Cramps.

- que:
  - Hi... Busy?
  ans:
  - Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.

- que:
  - Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
  ans:
  - I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.

- que:
  - You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
  ans:
  - Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.

- que:
  - Really? You think this is its way of saying \"Hi there\" to the people of the Earth?
  ans:
  - There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.

- que:
  - That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
  ans:
  - ... My God...

- que:
  - Then how.?
  ans:
  - Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.

- que:
  - Naturally. So what is your problem?
  ans:
  - Acceleration is no longer a constant.

- que:
  - ... Best shot...?
  ans:
  - Guess, Spock. Your best guess.

- que:
  - What the hell do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - Reading the patient's vital signs.

- que:
  - We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
  ans:
  - What's your degree in, dentistry?

- que:
  - Find it?
  ans:
  - Yes, under \"U.S. Government.\" Now we need directions.

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.

- que:
  - My name?
  ans:
  - Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.

- que:
  - That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
  ans:
  - Shields, Mr. Chekov.

- que:
  - Understood. What is your plan?
  ans:
  - Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.

- que:
  - \"Neutralized?\" How?
  ans:
  - We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...

- que:
  - Can you protect us?
  ans:
  - We are launching everything we have.

- que:
  - I suppose they told you that...?
  ans:
  - The hell they did.

- que:
  - Is there something wrong with the one I have?
  ans:
  - You mean man...

- que:
  - How soon?
  ans:
  - Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.

- que:
  - Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
  ans:
  - There's really very little point in my trying to explain.

- que:
  - I buy that. What about him?
  ans:
  - He's harmless. Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.

- que:
  - Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
  ans:
  - Iowa.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - What's going to happen when you release the whales?
  ans:
  - They're gonna hafta take their chances.

- que:
  - He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
  ans:
  - It's his way.

- que:
  - Do you trust me?
  ans:
  - Implicitly.

- que:
  - So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
  ans:
  - Just lucky, I guess.

- que:
  - How will that be done, exactly?
  ans:
  - They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.

- que:
  - Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
  ans:
  - See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.

- que:
  - My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
  ans:
  - It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.

- que:
  - Who do you think I am?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me, you're from outer space.

- que:
  - All right. The truth?
  ans:
  - I'm all ears.

- que:
  - You want the details?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.

- que:
  - Sorry, that's classified. I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
  ans:
  - It wouldn't be my first choice, no.

- que:
  - Here... In the park?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
  ans:
  - He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.

- que:
  - I belong here. Suppose by some miracle you do get them through. Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
  ans:
  - ... You have a point...

- que:
  - Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. I'll find you. See you around the galaxy...

- que:
  - Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
  ans:
  - Well, I... find that understandable I mean, you've been through a lot. Station, please.

- que:
  - To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
  ans:
  - Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?

- que:
  - Spock...?
  ans:
  - As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.

- que:
  - Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
  ans:
  - The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.

- que:
  - Is there any other planet where this species exists?
  ans:
  - The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.

- que:
  - But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
  ans:
  - There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.

- que:
  - Mr. Spock, your computations?
  ans:
  - In progress, Admiral.

- que:
  - What is our target in time?
  ans:
  - The late 20th Century.

- que:
  - You've programmed that from memory...?
  ans:
  - I have.

- que:
  - Earth... But when?... Spock?
  ans:
  - Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.

- que:
  - And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it. How much?
  ans:
  - Simple logic will suffice. We need a map. That one should do.

- que:
  - How do you know this...?
  ans:
  - ... Simple logic.

- que:
  - For example?
  ans:
  - Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.

- que:
  - What else did you learn from your mind meld?
  ans:
  - They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.

- que:
  - They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us?
  ans:
  - I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.

- que:
  - He meant what you were saying on the tour, that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
  ans:
  - How will playing cards help?

- que:
  - Status?
  ans:
  - The tank will be finished by morning...

- que:
  - That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
  ans:
  - No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.

- que:
  - Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
  ans:
  - No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.

- que:
  - Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
  ans:
  - Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.

- que:
  - Can we make breakaway speed!?
  ans:
  - Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.

- que:
  - Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
  ans:
  - They did, Admiral.

- que:
  - Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
  ans:
  - Then... Where the hell are we?

- que:
  - Weapons systems?
  ans:
  - Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.

- que:
  - Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
  ans:
  - Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
  ans:
  - 283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...

- que:
  - Any luck...?
  ans:
  - Nothing... I should never have left him...

- que:
  - Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
  ans:
  - Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.

- que:
  - Scotty, how long is this bay?
  ans:
  - About 60 feet, Admiral.

- que:
  - I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
  ans:
  - Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.

- que:
  - Humpbacked - people.?
  ans:
  - Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.

- que:
  - Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
  ans:
  - You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember, two of them.

- que:
  - Two?
  ans:
  - It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.

- que:
  - I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
  ans:
  - Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.

- que:
  - Scotty, Are the whale tanks secure?
  ans:
  - Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.

- que:
  - How long, Scotty?
  ans:
  - I'll have to re-energize.

- que:
  - The explosive override -- ?
  ans:
  - Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.

- que:
  - Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - ... Yes?
  ans:
  - I notice you're still working with polymers.

- que:
  - Sill? What else would I be working with?
  ans:
  - That's easy, 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.

- que:
  - Hello? Computer...?
  ans:
  - Just use the keyboard...

- que:
  - Transparent aluminum?
  ans:
  - Oh, here and there. I flew something similar in my Academy days.

- que:
  - Father...?
  ans:
  - I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.

- que:
  - Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
  ans:
  - Tell her I feel fine...

- que:
  - Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
  ans:
  - Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na. I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.

- que:
  - Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na. Wait my son. What is your name?
  ans:
  - Sulu Hikaru.

- que:
  - Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
  ans:
  - I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't like to leave questions unanswered.

- que:
  - I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
  ans:
  - Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...

- que:
  - Deceive us?
  ans:
  - Don't panic...

- que:
  - I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
  ans:
  - We've... just begun to. I suppose you're seventy-five.

- que:
  - An apprentice for thirty years. We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
  ans:
  - More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.

- que:
  - A perfect moment?
  ans:
  - When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...

- que:
  - There's one thing I don't understand. In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
  ans:
  - I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.

- que:
  - ... an offlander?
  ans:
  - For someone so young.

- que:
  - Jak'tahla?
  ans:
  - Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...

- que:
  - What's the rush?
  ans:
  - I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...

- que:
  - Mother and son. You arranged this...?
  ans:
  - I thought it might begin the healing process.

- que:
  - Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
  ans:
  - The \"mighty\" Federation could learn a few things from this village...

- que:
  - You're what?
  ans:
  - I am better.

- que:
  - Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine?
  ans:
  - I aspire to be more than I am.

- que:
  - Don't you ever get tired?
  ans:
  - My power cells continually re- charge themselves.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - Do machines ever play?
  ans:
  - Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.

- que:
  - Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
  ans:
  - Androids... don't have...fun.

- que:
  - Why not...?
  ans:
  - No one's ever asked me that before.

- que:
  - Can he breathe under water?
  ans:
  - Data doesn't breathe.

- que:
  - Won't he rust?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The artificial lifeform was right?
  ans:
  - If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.

- que:
  - VOICE And our people?
  ans:
  - They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...

- que:
  - VOICE Are they in any danger?
  ans:
  - VOICE Very good, Doctor. Picard out.

- que:
  - Will he live?
  ans:
  - Yes. But look at this medscan...

- que:
  - Is it safe to move her?
  ans:
  - Safer than leaving her here.

- que:
  - Captain, Geordi...?
  ans:
  - You're aboard the Enterprise.

- que:
  - What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
  ans:
  - How about a passive radiation scan?

- que:
  - Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...

- que:
  - Will the structure hold if we blast through?
  ans:
  - I believe it is safe, sir.

- que:
  - Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
  ans:
  - You're not going to launch anything until...

- que:
  - You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
  ans:
  - ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...

- que:
  - What kind of concerns?
  ans:
  - Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

- que:
  - You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
  ans:
  - In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.

- que:
  - You're not finished here?
  ans:
  - Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.

- que:
  - Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
  ans:
  - A planet in Federation space...

- que:
  - How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
  ans:
  - Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.

- que:
  - Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
  ans:
  - I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours. There is still a way home, Gal'na.

- que:
  - Do you know how to disable the injector?
  ans:
  - But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.

- que:
  - Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
  ans:
  - No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...

- que:
  - Recommendations?
  ans:
  - There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.

- que:
  - May I talk to you alone?
  ans:
  - Deploy the collector.

- que:
  - Are they...?
  ans:
  - We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.

- que:
  - The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
  ans:
  - When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...

- que:
  - Do you know how they were damaged?
  ans:
  - By a Son'a weapon. There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.

- que:
  - Why would they fire at him without provocation?
  ans:
  - All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...

- que:
  - Fail-safe?
  ans:
  - His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...

- que:
  - Implants bothering you?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. I'm just tired.

- que:
  - A photon torpedo. Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
  ans:
  - I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.

- que:
  - Will that stop the tear?
  ans:
  - You got me, Commander.

- que:
  - That's your expert opinion?
  ans:
  - We're pulling it like a zipper across space...

- que:
  - VOICE Options?
  ans:
  - Eject the core.

- que:
  - The purpose being...?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...

- que:
  - How long 'til they reach us?
  ans:
  - Eighteen minutes...

- que:
  - What's inside that nebula cluster?
  ans:
  - Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...

- que:
  - Deck ten.
  ans:
  - ... so they need us to put out one more brush fire. Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Commander Riker...

- que:
  - So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
  ans:
  - The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...

- que:
  - Would you like something to eat?
  ans:
  - No, we're here to... rescue them.

- que:
  - You've not aged a day since then?
  ans:
  - Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.

- que:
  - Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
  ans:
  - It's good to have you back, Worf. Slow to one-third. Take us in.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...

- que:
  - Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
  ans:
  - No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...

- que:
  - Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
  ans:
  - No, sir...

- que:
  - Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
  ans:
  - No, sir. It is a gorch.

- que:
  - Gorch?
  ans:
  - Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...

- que:
  - Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
  ans:
  - No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.

- que:
  - Can you beam him off?
  ans:
  - Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...

- que:
  - Is there any other way to disable the injector?
  ans:
  - ... Population three hundred million...

- que:
  - Counselor?
  ans:
  - They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...

- que:
  - Why was Data assigned?
  ans:
  - \"Environmental concerns\", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...

- que:
  - What are they interested in...?
  ans:
  - Wine, women and song.

- que:
  - Why would we be involved with these people?
  ans:
  - Good question.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - What you're doing to my neck...

- que:
  - Was I doing something to your neck?
  ans:
  - It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...

- que:
  - No children?
  ans:
  - If that's true, they're a dying race.

- que:
  - Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
  ans:
  - Whatever makes you comfortable...

- que:
  - Why don't you try sitting up?
  ans:
  - Or you could try lying down.

- que:
  - Augh?
  ans:
  - Initiate launch sequence.

- que:
  - This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
  ans:
  - 2 They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.

- que:
  - Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
  ans:
  - We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.

- que:
  - Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
  ans:
  - It's Cochrane.

- que:
  - Are you saying they won't help us?
  ans:
  - I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.

- que:
  - I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
  ans:
  - I'll be fine. He's a different story.

- que:
  - You actually performed surgery...?
  ans:
  - It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...

- que:
  - He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - You think they're still up there?
  ans:
  - If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.

- que:
  - How long has he been unconscious?
  ans:
  - At least four hours.

- que:
  - Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
  ans:
  - We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.

- que:
  - You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
  ans:
  - Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...

- que:
  - Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
  ans:
  - It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.

- que:
  - You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
  ans:
  - I do not know what you are referring to.

- que:
  - Do you know what this is, Data?
  ans:
  - It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.

- que:
  - Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
  ans:
  - I... do not want this...

- que:
  - Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
  ans:
  - My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.

- que:
  - A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Isn't it better like this...?
  ans:
  - Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...

- que:
  - Vulcan?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can you configure it?
  ans:
  - I believe so.

- que:
  - Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
  ans:
  - It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I have helm control.

- que:
  - Where's the Sphere?
  ans:
  - The vortex is collapsing, sir.

- que:
  - What year is it?
  ans:
  - According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I am the Borg.

- que:
  - Did you know her?
  ans:
  - Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.

- que:
  - Data... are you sure you're all right?
  ans:
  - I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...

- que:
  - \"APR cell count?\" What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.

- que:
  - Juice?
  ans:
  - Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.

- que:
  - Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
  ans:
  - Understood. Keep me informed.

- que:
  - How serious is the damage?
  ans:
  - I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.

- que:
  - Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
  ans:
  - Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...

- que:
  - Ready to make a little history?
  ans:
  - Always am.

- que:
  - What's still there?
  ans:
  - Their com system must still be down.

- que:
  - Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
  ans:
  - They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?

- que:
  - Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. And you are?
  ans:
  - Jean-Luc Picard.

- que:
  - Great name. French?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where in the States?
  ans:
  - Oh... here and there. You know how it is.

- que:
  - Where are you from most recently?
  ans:
  - California. San Francisco.

- que:
  - That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
  ans:
  - It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.

- que:
  - And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
  ans:
  - I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.

- que:
  - Something wrong with that?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - The invasion plans.

- que:
  - These people you're calling \"Vulcans\"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
  ans:
  - There is no invasion...

- que:
  - Thank God this plate was already fixed.
  ans:
  - What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?

- que:
  - Cochrane?
  ans:
  - Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.

- que:
  - Did you need something?
  ans:
  - Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.

- que:
  - Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
  ans:
  - \"Money.\" So you can get dome money...

- que:
  - You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
  ans:
  - No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.

- que:
  - Fraid not.
  ans:
  - Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're lying.

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.

- que:
  - Were the two of you... involved?
  ans:
  - No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.

- que:
  - How did you know about that?
  ans:
  - Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.

- que:
  - All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
  ans:
  - We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.

- que:
  - Or...?
  ans:
  - Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.

- que:
  - You're leaving, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I have to...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you. Don't stop now.

- que:
  - Life signs?
  ans:
  - Population... thirty-five billion... All Borg.

- que:
  - Captain...?
  ans:
  - We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.

- que:
  - Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status?
  ans:
  - Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.

- que:
  - Life signs?
  ans:
  - Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.

- que:
  - Captain?
  ans:
  - And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...

- que:
  - Return to our own time?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
  ans:
  - It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.

- que:
  - What are they doing?
  ans:
  - They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.

- que:
  - Agreed. Options?
  ans:
  - Destroy the deflector dish.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.

- que:
  - Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
  ans:
  - They're bypassing Engineering...

- que:
  - Where the hell are they going?
  ans:
  - To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

- que:
  - Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
  ans:
  - I remember it made me sick.

- que:
  - What are you suggesting?
  ans:
  - I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...

- que:
  - VOICE Worf? Is something wrong?
  ans:
  - Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.

- que:
  - VOICE What the hell happened down there, Worf?
  ans:
  - Commander... we have a problem.

- que:
  - Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
  ans:
  - There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.

- que:
  - Even Data?
  ans:
  - Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...

- que:
  - What kind of message?
  ans:
  - Mr. President.

- que:
  - I wish I knew. Uhura?
  ans:
  - Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...

- que:
  - Can you - ?
  ans:
  - Thanks...

- que:
  - What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
  ans:
  - Figures.

- que:
  - Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
  ans:
  - Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.

- que:
  - Bones, are you afraid of the future?
  ans:
  - That was the general idea I intended to convey.

- que:
  - Are we playing multiple choice?
  ans:
  - Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen; I was frightened, really frightened.

- que:
  - Specifically of...?
  ans:
  - More than ever.

- que:
  - No way. You see this?
  ans:
  - It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.

- que:
  - ARE YOU CRAZY?
  ans:
  - Damned clever if you ask me...

- que:
  - Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
  ans:
  - Now there's a poser.

- que:
  - Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
  ans:
  - Too bad we can't SMELL her.

- que:
  - Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
  ans:
  - Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.

- que:
  - Stand...?
  ans:
  - Retire.

- que:
  - Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
  ans:
  - Barely.

- que:
  - Have you saved patients as \"barely\" alive as he was?
  ans:
  - I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.

- que:
  - They'll make it look like an accident...
  ans:
  - You say you are due for retirement. May I ask, do your hands shake?

- que:
  - What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
  ans:
  - I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.

- que:
  - I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
  ans:
  - I thought I would assume a pleasing shape. We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.

- que:
  - Would you care to go topside?
  ans:
  - Very much.

- que:
  - Take them away.
  ans:
  - I beg your pardon?

- que:
  - Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
  ans:
  - The drink WAS served...

- que:
  - Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
  ans:
  - I checked the data banks, yes.

- que:
  - That isn't true...!
  ans:
  - And what did they tell you?

- que:
  - Are those your words?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Spoken by you?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
  ans:
  - I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.

- que:
  - Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
  ans:
  - As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.

- que:
  - Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge?
  ans:
  - Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...

- que:
  - Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
  ans:
  - Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on \"Stun\" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...

- que:
  - Where IS the conference?
  ans:
  - She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.

- que:
  - Course heading, Captain?
  ans:
  - Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...

- que:
  - What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
  ans:
  - You tell them, Lieutenant.

- que:
  - Now we go to Starfleet?
  ans:
  - Now we expand our search to include uniforms.

- que:
  - ALL uniforms?
  ans:
  - Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...

- que:
  - She programmed the torpedo hits?
  ans:
  - Aye, sir.

- que:
  - Mr. Valtane, any more data?
  ans:
  - Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.

- que:
  - Do we report this, sir?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? Send to Starfleet Command...

- que:
  - Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
  ans:
  - We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.

- que:
  - Isn't it about time you became something else?
  ans:
  - I like it here...

- que:
  - Krandog aranty.
  ans:
  - What took you so long?

- que:
  - How did you know...?
  ans:
  - There's a reward for your death.

- que:
  - How much time's left of your sentence?
  ans:
  - Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.

- que:
  - Anything else you want to tell me?
  ans:
  - When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

- que:
  - Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
  ans:
  - Possibly.

- que:
  - Candidate for what?
  ans:
  - Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman - ... so I volunteered.

- que:
  - Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
  ans:
  - Aye, sir.

- que:
  - Kronos, sir?
  ans:
  - I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.

- que:
  - Just the prototype.
  ans:
  - Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?

- que:
  - You hear that?
  ans:
  - This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.

- que:
  - When does this conference start?
  ans:
  - According to my information, today.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - There's an old Vulcan proverb, only Nixon could go to China.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I am uncertain.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Curiously it appears to emanate from us.

- que:
  - The peace conference.
  ans:
  - From Enterprise?

- que:
  - What peace conference?
  ans:
  - I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.

- que:
  - Why would they give them to us?
  ans:
  - The Commander is an old friend of yours.

- que:
  - Are you dining on worms?
  ans:
  - You were right, it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.

- que:
  - Close enough to beam down?
  ans:
  - Not yet... Section 4236...

- que:
  - What's she waiting for?
  ans:
  - Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.

- que:
  - Uhura?
  ans:
  - Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.

- que:
  - Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
  ans:
  - I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.

- que:
  - Faith...?
  ans:
  - That the universe will unfold as it should.

- que:
  - Her own father...?
  ans:
  - Such things have happened before, sir.

- que:
  - Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
  ans:
  - Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.

- que:
  - A lie?
  ans:
  - An error.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.

- que:
  - You having hearing problems, mister?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - ... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

- que:
  - Praxis?
  ans:
  - What's left of it.

- que:
  - And if they're still in place?
  ans:
  - Then someone forged a data bank entry.

- que:
  - How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What exactly does that mean?
  ans:
  - It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.

- que:
  - Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
  ans:
  - I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.

- que:
  - You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
  ans:
  - At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.

- que:
  - Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
  ans:
  - They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.

- que:
  - Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
  ans:
  - You are me.

- que:
  - Do you know where you are?
  ans:
  - I am in a room with lights.

- que:
  - Can you remember our father?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is that your final answer?
  ans:
  - Brother. I cannot move.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because you are dangerous.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.

- que:
  - Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No. Can I move now?
  ans:
  - No. I must deactivate you.

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - Indefinitely.

- que:
  - It'll serve you right.
  ans:
  - How long is that?

- que:
  - Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.

- que:
  - When was he... created?
  ans:
  - About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.

- que:
  - Remember him?
  ans:
  - He was a bit proud as I recall.

- que:
  - Is he very much like you were?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can you describe it, Deanna?
  ans:
  - But the Romulans abandoned the plan.

- que:
  - How long does he have?
  ans:
  - I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

- que:
  - And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
  ans:
  - Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...

- que:
  - And this makes you \"sad\"?
  ans:
  - That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.

- que:
  - Good work. The download?
  ans:
  - He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.

- que:
  - We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
  ans:
  - Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.

- que:
  - Do you think this is a wise course of action?
  ans:
  - At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.

- que:
  - Of you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How can you be sure?
  ans:
  - I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

- que:
  - It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.

- que:
  - Why am I looking at me?
  ans:
  - You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

- que:
  - How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
  ans:
  - I thought only me, myself and Lore.

- que:
  - Do you have a name, sir?
  ans:
  - I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.

- que:
  - He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
  ans:
  - I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.

- que:
  - It seems to be a redundant memory port. Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
  ans:
  - Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.

- que:
  - It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
  ans:
  - No, I do not mind.

- que:
  - What is our approximate distance?
  ans:
  - It appears to be... ... an arm.

- que:
  - Why is it moving?
  ans:
  - Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.

- que:
  - I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
  ans:
  - If you wouldn't mind.

- que:
  - May I have this dance?
  ans:
  - With pleasure, Captain.

- que:
  - Do you have a moment, sir?
  ans:
  - Of course, sit down.

- que:
  - You're speaking of emotional investment?
  ans:
  - As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.

- que:
  - Is he sincere about wanting peace?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How could I not?
  ans:
  - Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.

- que:
  - How can you be certain?
  ans:
  - I know how he thinks.

- que:
  - Counselor?
  ans:
  - The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle, me.

- que:
  - Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
  ans:
  - I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.

- que:
  - Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
  ans:
  - Your timing is impeccable, Commander.

- que:
  - Do you have life support?
  ans:
  - Do you have life support?

- que:
  - It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
  ans:
  - Understood.

- que:
  - What do we know about the planet?
  ans:
  - Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.

- que:
  - Theories?
  ans:
  - I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.

- que:
  - What do we know about the population?
  ans:
  - Cannon fodder.

- que:
  - What programs were accessed?
  ans:
  - Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.

- que:
  - What's he doing?
  ans:
  - He wants to look me in the eye.

- que:
  - How long until he can fire?
  ans:
  - The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.

- que:
  - New Praetor?
  ans:
  - There's more... as always. He's Reman.

- que:
  - Not with the Romulans.
  ans:
  - Not with the Romulans.

- que:
  - What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
  ans:
  - I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.

- que:
  - Wont do what, Mister Worf?
  ans:
  - Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.

- que:
  - Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
  ans:
  - I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.

- que:
  - To find the head, sir?
  ans:
  - If you don't mind.

- que:
  - Who was it?
  ans:
  - Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Your new chair, sir.

- que:
  - A coup d'etat?
  ans:
  - The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.

- que:
  - Why don't they answer our hails?
  ans:
  - It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.

- que:
  - Counselor?
  ans:
  - Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.

- que:
  - Strength in numbers?
  ans:
  - We can only hope so.

- que:
  - I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - Praetor Shinzon?
  ans:
  - And you're not as we imagined you.

- que:
  - Praetor?
  ans:
  - I've never met a human woman.

- que:
  - I am, Commander Riker... May I touch your hair?
  ans:
  - On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.

- que:
  - And the Senate supports you?
  ans:
  - I have dissolved the Senate.

- que:
  - Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.

- que:
  - You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
  ans:
  - No race should be a slave to another.

- que:
  - Were we always explorers?
  ans:
  - No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...

- que:
  - So I'm not as tall as you expected?
  ans:
  - I always hoped I would hit two meters.

- que:
  - Why am I here?
  ans:
  - I was lonely...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.

- que:
  - All of this so you could capture me?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.

- que:
  - What's this all about?
  ans:
  - It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...

- que:
  - And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
  ans:
  - I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.

- que:
  - My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
  ans:
  - If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.

- que:
  - Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
  ans:
  - It amazes me how little you know yourself.

- que:
  - Why are you here?
  ans:
  - To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.

- que:
  - And what of the Enterprise?
  ans:
  - You know that's not possible.

- que:
  - What about Picard?
  ans:
  - Our greater goal is more important, brother.

- que:
  - Should I raise shields?
  ans:
  - Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

- que:
  - Are we prepared?
  ans:
  - A matter of hours now.

- que:
  - How long until we reach the Rift?
  ans:
  - Seven minutes.

- que:
  - Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
  ans:
  - They're holding position.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - They will obey, Praetor.

- que:
  - How many Warbirds will you need?
  ans:
  - None.

- que:
  - And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
  ans:
  - I have a purpose.

- que:
  - The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
  ans:
  - Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?

- que:
  - Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
  ans:
  - For the moment.

- que:
  - It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
  ans:
  - Benny, there's nothing there.

- que:
  - What did I tell you?
  ans:
  - Probably kids.

- que:
  - Don't you think you should call a backup?
  ans:
  - No, we can handle this.

- que:
  - Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right?
  ans:
  - I don't think so...

- que:
  - How much are your rooms?
  ans:
  - Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.

- que:
  - You have one with two beds?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?
  ans:
  - Credit card.

- que:
  - Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
  ans:
  - We should have. Let me see.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I make maps.

- que:
  - Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
  ans:
  - Eh... yes.

- que:
  - Make any money?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you have children?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you think of America?
  ans:
  - Stay right there...

- que:
  - What was your last stop?
  ans:
  - Elmo's...

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - About five miles back.

- que:
  - Recognize this?
  ans:
  - It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.

- que:
  - There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
  ans:
  - I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...

- que:
  - Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
  ans:
  - Neither did I.

- que:
  - Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
  ans:
  - Contain it and get back to me.

- que:
  - Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
  ans:
  - We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.

- que:
  - When can we expect containment?
  ans:
  - Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...

- que:
  - It's in a green Mustang?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.

- que:
  - Why did you let it get into a populated area?
  ans:
  - It's taken on a disguise.

- que:
  - Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
  ans:
  - It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...

- que:
  - Is that what's affecting your performance?
  ans:
  - You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.

- que:
  - What's all this for?
  ans:
  - We have a new directive. I'm taking over.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I just retired.

- que:
  - This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

- que:
  - Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
  ans:
  - I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.

- que:
  - Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
  ans:
  - Marc Shermin.

- que:
  - Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Haydn...

- que:
  - Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
  ans:
  - Please...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - What.

- que:
  - Which way?
  ans:
  - That way.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Flashlight.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Coupons.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Pancakes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - X...

- que:
  - Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
  ans:
  - We're going to have to stop for gas soon.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Smile.

- que:
  - Smile... good?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Minneapolis... good.

- que:
  - You're full of tricks, aren't you?
  ans:
  - No gas.

- que:
  - Gas good?
  ans:
  - Yes. Very good.

- que:
  - Closed?
  ans:
  - You'll see.

- que:
  - Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you?
  ans:
  - I am Jenny Haydn.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I am...

- que:
  - Space?
  ans:
  - Up there... I... eh... can't explain... But that's the only place you could be from.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - My... husband.

- que:
  - I am husband?
  ans:
  - No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.

- que:
  - Shit?
  ans:
  - No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Candy.

- que:
  - What is... ...Coke?
  ans:
  - A drink.

- que:
  - You want to try it?
  ans:
  - I want to try it.

- que:
  - Horses.
  ans:
  - What's the matter?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Music.

- que:
  - Why are you going here? What is here?
  ans:
  - My... ...car will take me... ...up there... home.

- que:
  - When do you have to be here?
  ans:
  - I do not understand.

- que:
  - Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
  ans:
  - Yes. Day... night.

- que:
  - How many days and nights do you have to go... ...here?
  ans:
  - Three nights... two days.

- que:
  - You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus... Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is that a baby?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - A baby is a new person?
  ans:
  - Eh... yes...

- que:
  - Do you have a baby?
  ans:
  - No... The closest...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.

- que:
  - I do not speak English.
  ans:
  - What is hitchhike?

- que:
  - You want this ticket?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The car will stop?
  ans:
  - Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...

- que:
  - When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...

- que:
  - Can I have the gun?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Go?
  ans:
  - Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Please stay.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's a kiss... Goodbye...

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I was afraid.

- que:
  - Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
  ans:
  - It was a mistake.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
  ans:
  - Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?

- que:
  - What is hell?
  ans:
  - It's bad.

- que:
  - Are you my friend?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
  ans:
  - Not all... but it feels like a kiss.

- que:
  - Do you have music up there?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
  ans:
  - I do not want to.

- que:
  - You liked my singing?
  ans:
  - Yes. Sing some more.

- que:
  - The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
  ans:
  - No. Get in.

- que:
  - Are you angry at me?
  ans:
  - No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.

- que:
  - I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
  ans:
  - The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I must meet my ship.

- que:
  - Why can't we wait here for a ride?
  ans:
  - The cook.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - You can stop. I will go on alone.

- que:
  - Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
  ans:
  - I used the last one to jump off the cliff...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You don't forget anything, do you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
  ans:
  - Hello... hello. How are you this morning?

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I want to gamble.

- que:
  - The cook again?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What will you say about us?
  ans:
  - I will say that we can be friends.

- que:
  - Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
  ans:
  - You want the baby to laugh at me.

- que:
  - How long will it take you to get home?
  ans:
  - Many, many days and nights...

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - The yellow one.

- que:
  - Where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.

- que:
  - I love you.
  ans:
  - What do I do now?

- que:
  - I'm never going to see you again, am I?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You sure this is your car?
  ans:
  - My grandmother's rich.

- que:
  - They after you?
  ans:
  - What? No, of course not.

- que:
  - If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
  ans:
  - Fly.

- que:
  - Wait. Could I have your autograph?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Is it for real?
  ans:
  - Get Fox.

- que:
  - Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
  ans:
  - Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.

- que:
  - Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
  ans:
  - I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.

- que:
  - You get that, Lyman?
  ans:
  - This has always been my favorite time of day.

- que:
  - Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
  ans:
  - Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.

- que:
  - Can you see under the faceplate?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Was there visual contact?
  ans:
  - No, sir. Radar.

- que:
  - You married, Major?
  ans:
  - Twenty-eight years.

- que:
  - To the same woman?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - It was a man though... right?
  ans:
  - The police think he was high on drugs...

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.

- que:
  - Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
  ans:
  - Is there a reward in this?

- que:
  - You saw that?
  ans:
  - Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.

- que:
  - Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't think so.

- que:
  - I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?
  ans:
  - Bullshit politics.

- que:
  - Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?
  ans:
  - I already got a real one. Come on, it won't be too bad. It's not personal.

- que:
  - What's all this squid shit?
  ans:
  - Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.

- que:
  - A tragic story, no doubt. How'd you get up here?
  ans:
  - I made my choice, Lenny.

- que:
  - What're you going to do?
  ans:
  - Watch and see.

- que:
  - I don't feel anything. Is it on?
  ans:
  - Forget it's there.

- que:
  - Faith, call me, okay?
  ans:
  - No, Lenny.

- que:
  - You talked to Iris? When?
  ans:
  - Tonight.

- que:
  - I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
  ans:
  - Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.

- que:
  - What? He gonna record you on his label?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Max Pelcher? You're kidding?
  ans:
  - Can't do it.

- que:
  - Who did it?
  ans:
  - Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.

- que:
  - How did it happen? What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
  ans:
  - We should talk alone.

- que:
  - You think Tran killed her?
  ans:
  - The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.

- que:
  - You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What kind of things exactly?
  ans:
  - Exactly anything. Whatever you want. Whoever you want to be. Fabri, get us another round, would you.

- que:
  - What? Right Here?
  ans:
  - Step into my office.

- que:
  - Thanks, Max.
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?

- que:
  - D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
  ans:
  - This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.

- que:
  - Hey, Iris, you okay?
  ans:
  - See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.

- que:
  - You should feel like shit.
  ans:
  - An ex-cop that doesn't carry. It's embarrassing. I oughta not be seen with you. Hey, Mace. What's goin' on?

- que:
  - I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right?
  ans:
  - Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.

- que:
  - You alright? Y'okay?
  ans:
  - He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her...

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.

- que:
  - Faith OK?
  ans:
  - No. But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.

- que:
  - Whattya mean?
  ans:
  - All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.

- que:
  - What stuff?
  ans:
  - Jesus.

- que:
  - Okay... what about Strickland?
  ans:
  - No. Bad idea.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Give him the tape. See? It's fucking brilliant! The tape for Faith. I know he'll go for it. I can set it up.

- que:
  - This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
  ans:
  - 2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.

- que:
  - Where's Faith?
  ans:
  - I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.

- que:
  - What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
  ans:
  - You just did.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
  ans:
  - That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.

- que:
  - You bet. Did you like it?
  ans:
  - Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect.

- que:
  - How did you hook up with Faith?
  ans:
  - Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

- que:
  - How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
  ans:
  - With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.

- que:
  - Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
  ans:
  - Fuck that! The last part's the best. You dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black.

- que:
  - What else you got?
  ans:
  - Whoa. That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, it's cutting awful close to me. I mean she was just here.

- que:
  - Who was just here?
  ans:
  - Iris, man. Pay attention.

- que:
  - She never gave me a tape.
  ans:
  - What clip? What was it?

- que:
  - You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny? For old time's sake? Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
  ans:
  - You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.

- que:
  - That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
  ans:
  - Charm.

- que:
  - Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
  ans:
  - I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.

- que:
  - Your sex life?
  ans:
  - Your existence.

- que:
  - Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand?
  ans:
  - Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.

- que:
  - So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
  ans:
  - No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - Fumitsu.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you doing?
  ans:
  - Coming with you.

- que:
  - Are we having a bad night?
  ans:
  - Let's talk in the car.

- que:
  - Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry?
  ans:
  - I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.

- que:
  - In LA? Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - I need my case. It's still in the back.

- que:
  - Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here. D'you mind?
  ans:
  - I thought we were friends.

- que:
  - You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I don't see a way out of it.

- que:
  - Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
  ans:
  - Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.

- que:
  - Rams... that's football, right?
  ans:
  - Forget her.

- que:
  - What's that? Present from Faith?
  ans:
  - No idea.

- que:
  - My God, Lenny. What is it?
  ans:
  - Black. Jack.

- que:
  - Are you sure it's real?
  ans:
  - Never really thought about it.

- que:
  - Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?
  ans:
  - That's where it gets a little strange.

- que:
  - And what about the guy that was following me?
  ans:
  - Now you're really getting paranoid.

- que:
  - The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How's Zander?
  ans:
  - OK. He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.

- que:
  - Where we going?
  ans:
  - Anywhere. We'll talk about it in the car.

- que:
  - You better keep a low profile for a while.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - Lenny, have you lost it completely?
  ans:
  - Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.

- que:
  - Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?
  ans:
  - I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - It's the walk. Something. Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address. We gotta keep moving.

- que:
  - Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?
  ans:
  - I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.

- que:
  - Yeah I know. So what do we do?
  ans:
  - We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.

- que:
  - There's a plus side?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He's totally cut off from the outer world.

- que:
  - Who's Strickland?
  ans:
  - Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.

- que:
  - And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
  ans:
  - No. It didn't.

- que:
  - Got your ticket?
  ans:
  - No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.

- que:
  - You see Tran?
  ans:
  - Uh unh.

- que:
  - And do what? Take on his whole posse?
  ans:
  - I still got one ace to play. Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...

- que:
  - Oh boy. What if you're wrong?
  ans:
  - Then we'll be right where we are now.

- que:
  - Are we under arrest?
  ans:
  - Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.

- que:
  - Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?
  ans:
  - Just Lenny.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Sucks. Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

- que:
  - Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
  ans:
  - Yup. He was Jeriko's manager. Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

- que:
  - Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created. It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
  ans:
  - Um... he was older.

- que:
  - Testa?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
  ans:
  - Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.

- que:
  - Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Agents Duncan, Mackelway. Anything new?
  ans:
  - Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.

- que:
  - Anybody talk to the press?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - You run the plates?
  ans:
  - Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.

- que:
  - Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
  ans:
  - Ten miles back on the Texas side.

- que:
  - Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
  ans:
  - I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.

- que:
  - You're thinking...?
  ans:
  - Who knows.

- que:
  - This isn't in our database?
  ans:
  - I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.

- que:
  - What's the bad news?
  ans:
  - You tell me.

- que:
  - What does the Manager say?
  ans:
  - I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.

- que:
  - And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night. Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
  ans:
  - Show's over, boys. Nobody home.

- que:
  - Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
  ans:
  - Hi there.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.

- que:
  - You have the body?
  ans:
  - She's buried.

- que:
  - I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
  ans:
  - Winona.

- que:
  - I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me. Ever handle a serial case?
  ans:
  - Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.

- que:
  - Hi. What's in the case?
  ans:
  - You... surprised me.

- que:
  - Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around. Whatja sell?
  ans:
  - Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.

- que:
  - You must travel a lot, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Whole country or just hereabouts?
  ans:
  - I don't mean to be rude, but...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.

- que:
  - Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
  ans:
  - Look, mister...

- que:
  - Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
  ans:
  - My God.

- que:
  - Not bad, huh?
  ans:
  - You're a... you're sick.

- que:
  - What's wrong with me?
  ans:
  - Calm down, Harold. Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold, there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - I've been looking for you.

- que:
  - The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did he look like?
  ans:
  - I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.

- que:
  - How did you know he was a construction worker?
  ans:
  - He had an orange hat on.

- que:
  - He was sitting here?
  ans:
  - It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.

- que:
  - What kind?
  ans:
  - An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.

- que:
  - What about his killer?
  ans:
  - Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner, no fingerprints, no trace evidence.

- que:
  - You have the photo from the diner?
  ans:
  - At the field office.

- que:
  - He said it was a clue?
  ans:
  - Maybe something to do with Zorro.

- que:
  - We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
  ans:
  - Maybe cause he's smart.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We have another one.

- que:
  - Another what?
  ans:
  - Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Speck. Harold Speck.

- que:
  - From the grave?
  ans:
  - MyDick.

- que:
  - He got away. I had him. He got away.
  ans:
  - Then why do I still have a badge?

- que:
  - The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
  ans:
  - I'll take it into consideration.

- que:
  - I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
  ans:
  - They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.

- que:
  - You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
  ans:
  - Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.

- que:
  - Okay, Harold Speck, who goes first?
  ans:
  - Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.

- que:
  - How long ago?
  ans:
  - You knew the arm slash was not \"Zorro.\"

- que:
  - What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
  ans:
  - I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was \"Imelda.\" Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.

- que:
  - Collected shoes too?
  ans:
  - We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.

- que:
  - How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
  ans:
  - Huh?, sir.

- que:
  - Why did you go to Chicago?
  ans:
  - I was visiting an old college friend.

- que:
  - You didn't tell anyone where you were?
  ans:
  - An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.

- que:
  - Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
  ans:
  - I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.

- que:
  - What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
  ans:
  - Thank you, Rangers. Put this man in the unmarked.

- que:
  - You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
  ans:
  - The Academy, then CIIAC.

- que:
  - How long have you been downtown?
  ans:
  - Five months. I love it.

- que:
  - You work with Koessler?
  ans:
  - Not especially.

- que:
  - Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics. What did you do to piss him off?
  ans:
  - This is a sexy case.

- que:
  - What about the chat rooms themselves?
  ans:
  - That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.

- que:
  - They're all criminals?
  ans:
  - \"Gone live?\"

- que:
  - Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
  ans:
  - You got a point there.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Sex.

- que:
  - Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
  ans:
  - He thinks he looks young.

- que:
  - What's this country coming to?
  ans:
  - My guess, he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.

- que:
  - Me too. Make any headway with \"Zorro\"?
  ans:
  - None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.

- que:
  - That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
  ans:
  - He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.

- que:
  - Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most, that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
  ans:
  - You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.

- que:
  - Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
  ans:
  - Because you asked him to, stupid.

- que:
  - Does Koessler ask about me?
  ans:
  - He's called a couple times.

- que:
  - What did you tell him?
  ans:
  - Just routine stuff.

- que:
  - Not about coming to see Daitz?
  ans:
  - Not yet. Not about this, either.

- que:
  - We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
  ans:
  - Sue Ann Hanson.

- que:
  - Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
  ans:
  - Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.

- que:
  - And nobody else can do that?
  ans:
  - Not the way I can.

- que:
  - Jaime? Where are you?
  ans:
  - Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.

- que:
  - Start killing people for real?
  ans:
  - Suspect Zero.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Slow down a second, you met with Low --

- que:
  - And you're working with him?
  ans:
  - I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.

- que:
  - Does one exist?
  ans:
  - Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.

- que:
  - Koessler doesn't know any of this?
  ans:
  - I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.

- que:
  - Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
  ans:
  - Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.

- que:
  - But why this pattern?
  ans:
  - Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer. I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.

- que:
  - Tom, you okay?
  ans:
  - Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, of course.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - It's quite advanced.

- que:
  - All the same killer?
  ans:
  - Low calls him Suspect Zero.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I'm going to Amarillo.

- que:
  - Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
  ans:
  - Unlock these cuffs.

- que:
  - Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
  ans:
  - I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.

- que:
  - How did you know Speck was a killer?
  ans:
  - The little piggie speaks.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.

- que:
  - Agent Mackelway?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How's the arm?
  ans:
  - I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.

- que:
  - He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
  ans:
  - He's moved on to TV.

- que:
  - What was your weakness, sir?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.

- que:
  - So you went underground?
  ans:
  - I don't carry it with me.

- que:
  - Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
  ans:
  - Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.

- que:
  - How do you know who's real and who's not?
  ans:
  - And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.

- que:
  - You knew it was me all along?
  ans:
  - I already have an employer.

- que:
  - Who told you about her?
  ans:
  - You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.

- que:
  - You? You went by the book?
  ans:
  - Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.

- que:
  - Is he dead?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Was it Zero?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So you're the new meat?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What did you do to end up here?
  ans:
  - I believe it's in my file, sir.

- que:
  - Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
  ans:
  - Thomas Mackelway.

- que:
  - Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
  ans:
  - Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.

- que:
  - I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
  ans:
  - Four hundred and sixty, sir.

- que:
  - \"Attitude Adjustment Issues\" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.

- que:
  - Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Koessler?
  ans:
  - The same.

- que:
  - But why attack an Agent?
  ans:
  - He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.

- que:
  - How far is Amarillo?
  ans:
  - 350 miles.

- que:
  - Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
  ans:
  - Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.

- que:
  - Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
  ans:
  - This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.

- que:
  - What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
  ans:
  - Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.

- que:
  - You want to \"profile\" me? Find out what makes me \"tick\"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
  ans:
  - It's over for you.

- que:
  - Are you calling Her?
  ans:
  - No. Stop, come on.

- que:
  - Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
  ans:
  - You're money, baby.

- que:
  - What kind of car do you drive?
  ans:
  - Oh... a Cavalier.

- que:
  - You like laughing at the misery of others?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.

- que:
  - You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
  ans:
  - ...maybe...

- que:
  - You're a comedian?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's that like?
  ans:
  - I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.

- que:
  - Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.

- que:
  - Well, thank you...?
  ans:
  - Nikki.

- que:
  - Like the quiche?
  ans:
  - Yes. Like the quiche.

- que:
  - Why? You're not a real man?
  ans:
  - Not lately.

- que:
  - Just like that?
  ans:
  - Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.

- que:
  - How was it hard?
  ans:
  - Well, I left someone very special behind.

- que:
  - You too?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.

- que:
  - To do what?
  ans:
  - I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
  ans:
  - Uh, if the guy wants to.

- que:
  - You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
  ans:
  - Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.

- que:
  - Charles! What's up, man?
  ans:
  - Oh. You know.

- que:
  - Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
  ans:
  - No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...

- que:
  - What else is going on?
  ans:
  - Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...

- que:
  - Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
  ans:
  - I haven't heard an official \"no\" yet.

- que:
  - You haven't told then, huh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - ...Four days..?
  ans:
  - I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...

- que:
  - They were auditioning for the same role as you?
  ans:
  - It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.

- que:
  - The poor thing. Six years?
  ans:
  - ...And she's with someone else.

- que:
  - He's so sweet. He really said that?
  ans:
  - I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.

- que:
  - Could you believe it?
  ans:
  - Wait here, I'll get you that martini.

- que:
  - What do you guys do?
  ans:
  - I'm a comedian.

- que:
  - Sorry?
  ans:
  - You have to lay it on the table.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - You want this in black chips.

- que:
  - Do you have anything smaller?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...

- que:
  - Who's your booking agent?
  ans:
  - Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...

- que:
  - Well, who represents you back east?
  ans:
  - Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...

- que:
  - What do you do, Trent?
  ans:
  - I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's a rebound.

- que:
  - Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
  ans:
  - Six years.

- que:
  - You're a comedian?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And an actor.

- que:
  - Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
  ans:
  - ...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...

- que:
  - Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from \"You Bet Your Life\", right?
  ans:
  - Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.

- que:
  - Can I give you a ride to your car...?
  ans:
  - ...Nah. I'm right across the street...

- que:
  - ...Which one...?
  ans:
  - ...The red piece of shit over there...

- que:
  - Are you on the other line?
  ans:
  - Yeah, hold on.

- que:
  - Fine... I guess. You?
  ans:
  - Good. I think about things.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What kind of things?
  ans:
  - You know, us.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I miss you, Mike.

- que:
  - Why didn't you call?
  ans:
  - I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...

- que:
  - Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
  ans:
  - I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.

- que:
  - And what if I don't want to give up on her?
  ans:
  - You don't call.

- que:
  - So what's the difference?
  ans:
  - So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.

- que:
  - Right... Wait, what do you mean?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to say anything.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.

- que:
  - What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
  ans:
  - Kinda.

- que:
  - Oh no?
  ans:
  - I didn't mention her once today.

- que:
  - You want to hit the town tonight?
  ans:
  - I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.

- que:
  - What do you have? A Pluto call back?
  ans:
  - Sure. Kick me when I'm down.

- que:
  - How many strokes?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Eight or Nine.

- que:
  - What'd you get?
  ans:
  - An eight.

- que:
  - So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
  ans:
  - To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.

- que:
  - Oh. Where is this place?
  ans:
  - It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.

- que:
  - Kinda money, huh?
  ans:
  - Classy.

- que:
  - What's that guy's name? Sue?
  ans:
  - Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.

- que:
  - Him?
  ans:
  - There are so many beautiful women here.

- que:
  - I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
  ans:
  - I'll be your winger.

- que:
  - You haven't been drinking, have you?
  ans:
  - No. Just O.J.

- que:
  - What's the point?
  ans:
  - It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...

- que:
  - What's dumb about it?
  ans:
  - Well, you're doing so well...

- que:
  - They turned you down?
  ans:
  - They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.

- que:
  - You miss the pain?
  ans:
  - ...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.

- que:
  - Wow. You wanna grab a bite?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What's he do?
  ans:
  - He's trying to be an actor.

- que:
  - Who threw this party, anyway?
  ans:
  - Damned if I know...

- que:
  - How's it going for you two?
  ans:
  - Not well.

- que:
  - Rejected?
  ans:
  - Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.

- que:
  - You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
  ans:
  - But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...

- que:
  - Believe me, I know what that's like. Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
  ans:
  - Good for you, man. He's being smart.

- que:
  - Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
  ans:
  - Don't call me ever again.

- que:
  - Coffee... Two coffees. It says \"Breakfast Any Time\", right?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - S'up Trent?
  ans:
  - Lemme get off the other line, baby.

- que:
  - What are you talking about? Vegas?
  ans:
  - VEGAS.

- que:
  - What Vegas?
  ans:
  - We're going to Vegas.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tonight, baby.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.

- que:
  - That's not cool.
  ans:
  - Whu?

- que:
  - Did she, or did she not smile?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter...

- que:
  - What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
  ans:
  - Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.

- que:
  - You think they're watching?
  ans:
  - Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.

- que:
  - What?!?
  ans:
  - Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.

- que:
  - But I lost! How can you say always?!?
  ans:
  - ...Well, you know, not counting the first table.

- que:
  - Yea, how much?
  ans:
  - I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.

- que:
  - Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
  ans:
  - Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.

- que:
  - Who's the big winner?
  ans:
  - Mikey's the big winner.

- que:
  - What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
  ans:
  - I know she's coming back.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.

- que:
  - Stop. Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
  ans:
  - Whatever.

- que:
  - What was the part?
  ans:
  - Oh... \"I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad...\" Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.

- que:
  - \"Big Brother\", \"Little Brother\"?
  ans:
  - No, man. I need to use the phone.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I gotta use the phone.

- que:
  - She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
  ans:
  - You didn't have to get into it, baby.

- que:
  - I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
  ans:
  - No, baby. You're money.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I just need some time...

- que:
  - ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
  ans:
  - Selling scrap metal.

- que:
  - See? And what does this guy she's with do?
  ans:
  - He drives a carriage.

- que:
  - What?!?
  ans:
  - I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.

- que:
  - Please. And you're sweating him? You're \"all that\" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
  ans:
  - I hear she's getting real fat.

- que:
  - No. Doesn't that suck?
  ans:
  - What? That was the best part of the old game.

- que:
  - What time's this party tonight?
  ans:
  - It starts at eight...

- que:
  - Who? Rob?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You met him once.

- que:
  - How you guys doing?
  ans:
  - It's on.

- que:
  - Which one?
  ans:
  - Minnie Pearl.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You looked right at her, baby.

- que:
  - Was I money?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.

- que:
  - Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
  ans:
  - You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.

- que:
  - How long do I wait to call?
  ans:
  - A day.

- que:
  - Tomorrow?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - So, two days?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

- que:
  - What the fuck..?
  ans:
  - What an asshole. Didn't you see \"Boys in the Hood\"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.

- que:
  - You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
  ans:
  - I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.

- que:
  - You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
  ans:
  - What a surprise...

- que:
  - Is she looking at me, baby?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is she looking now?
  ans:
  - No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.

- que:
  - See, baby?
  ans:
  - Yes she did.

- que:
  - What was cold about it?
  ans:
  - It's on.

- que:
  - You think?
  ans:
  - Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...

- que:
  - ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
  ans:
  - ...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...

- que:
  - Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
  ans:
  - ...Shut up, Sue...

- que:
  - Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy?
  ans:
  - Six.

- que:
  - And you?
  ans:
  - I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.

- que:
  - The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
  ans:
  - No. You ask for too much.

- que:
  - What do you wish me to do?
  ans:
  - I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. I do not want his mother to see him as he is.

- que:
  - I swear I'm innocent. I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
  ans:
  - You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?

- que:
  - What's the matter, Carlo?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - You're staying home. You're not going out.
  ans:
  - What was that?

- que:
  - OK, OK. You gonna make me something to eat at least?
  ans:
  - The food is on the table.

- que:
  - You heard about your father?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
  ans:
  - Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.

- que:
  - How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
  ans:
  - Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.

- que:
  - That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
  ans:
  - No, just you and Paulie.

- que:
  - Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
  ans:
  - Understood.

- que:
  - You take care of Paulie?
  ans:
  - You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter.

- que:
  - How bad will it be?
  ans:
  - We gotta fight sometime. Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.

- que:
  - Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
  ans:
  - Maybe less...

- que:
  - You think we'll go for that last place?
  ans:
  - Maybe, or you gotta know now.

- que:
  - What percentages for my family?
  ans:
  - Thirty per cent. In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.

- que:
  - And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
  ans:
  - My compliments. I'll take care of them from my share.

- que:
  - So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
  ans:
  - If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.

- que:
  - Are you worried about security for your million?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
  ans:
  - I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...

- que:
  - You take care of your family?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Is it necessary?
  ans:
  - You understand him better than anyone.

- que:
  - When did he call?
  ans:
  - This morning.

- que:
  - No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
  ans:
  - I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. He won't last out the night.

- que:
  - What is this nonsense?
  ans:
  - It's from Johnny. It was announced this morning. He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.

- que:
  - When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
  ans:
  - Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.

- que:
  - He was the one behind Sollozzo?
  ans:
  - Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I wasn't sure until this day. No, it was Barzini all along.

- que:
  - Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
  ans:
  - Tom said he'd take care of it.

- que:
  - What was this for?
  ans:
  - For bravery.

- que:
  - And this?
  ans:
  - For killing a man.

- que:
  - And now, what do you choose to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to finish school.

- que:
  - Have you thought about a wife? A family?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then why have I become a man like you?
  ans:
  - A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.

- que:
  - What else do you believe in?
  ans:
  - I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.

- que:
  - How did you find out?
  ans:
  - I see you have your Luca Brasi.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...

- que:
  - Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Corleone.

- que:
  - Is that why there are more men on the walls?
  ans:
  - Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore. I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Bad news from America. Your brother, Santino. He has been killed.

- que:
  - How do you know I come from America?
  ans:
  - We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.

- que:
  - Hey America! Is she as rich as they say?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen. Is your wife coming with you?
  ans:
  - And hair. Black and curly, like a doll. And such a mouth.

- que:
  - Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
  ans:
  - He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.

- que:
  - Ever seen anything like that before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who are those girls?
  ans:
  - That's for you to find out.

- que:
  - Is the hospital covered?
  ans:
  - The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What about the hit list.

- que:
  - Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
  ans:
  - No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.

- que:
  - Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
  ans:
  - That's easy to say; it's not your father.

- que:
  - Was there a definite proposal?
  ans:
  - Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.

- que:
  - What about that Tattaglias? What will they do about Bruno?
  ans:
  - Part of the deal, Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

- que:
  - No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom. You just help me win. Understood?
  ans:
  - McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever. We'll wait.

- que:
  - One of Tattaglia's people?
  ans:
  - No. Our informer in McCluskey's precinct. Tonight at 8,00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx. Anyone know it.

- que:
  - Can you do it Mike?
  ans:
  - Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - An accident. No one was hurt.

- que:
  - Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
  ans:
  - Will you give this to him.

- que:
  - Sure. Anything I can do for you.
  ans:
  - He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?

- que:
  - No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - What about McCluskey?
  ans:
  - Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey. We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.

- que:
  - Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
  ans:
  - Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.

- que:
  - Mike, why am I out?
  ans:
  - You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.

- que:
  - How will they come at you?
  ans:
  - I know now. I'll make them call me Don.

- que:
  - Have you agreed on a meeting?
  ans:
  - A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.

- que:
  - Michael, what are those men doing?
  ans:
  - They're waiting to see my father.

- que:
  - Why do they bother him on a day like this?
  ans:
  - Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.

- que:
  - You really want to know?
  ans:
  - Yes. Tell me.

- que:
  - You like spaghetti?
  ans:
  - You know I love spaghetti.

- que:
  - If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
  ans:
  - My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. He's a good lawyer.

- que:
  - And what do you want for Christmas?
  ans:
  - Just you.

- que:
  - What will your father say?
  ans:
  - As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.

- que:
  - What time do they expect us?
  ans:
  - For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.

- que:
  - Michael, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.

- que:
  - Would you like me better if I were a nun?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Michael?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking about it.

- que:
  - How is your father?
  ans:
  - He'll be OK.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Tell me you love me.

- que:
  - Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - Can I go to the hospital with you?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.

- que:
  - When will I see you again?
  ans:
  - I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.

- que:
  - When will I see you again?
  ans:
  - Goodbye.

- que:
  - Don't you want dinner first?
  ans:
  - No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

- que:
  - Wake me up when you come to bed?
  ans:
  - Your sister wants to ask you something.

- que:
  - Let me think about it, O.K.?
  ans:
  - Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.

- que:
  - I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
  ans:
  - You just stand here one minute...

- que:
  - How's Mom?
  ans:
  - I can help you out...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - One of them fingered the old man.

- que:
  - Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
  ans:
  - Until the old man tells me different.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To the city.

- que:
  - What are you, inspecting the barracks? You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
  ans:
  - A million times.

- que:
  - O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
  ans:
  - Probably a year...

- que:
  - We're going to New Jersey?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
  ans:
  - Yes, I promise.

- que:
  - And all his works?
  ans:
  - I do renounce them.

- que:
  - Do you wish to be baptized?
  ans:
  - I do wish to be baptized.

- que:
  - He talked to you?
  ans:
  - I can arrange security.

- que:
  - Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
  ans:
  - Buy me out?...

- que:
  - You think I scam?
  ans:
  - Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. Players couldn't get a drink.

- que:
  - I think so. Detective squad?
  ans:
  - Right. Don't say my name, just listen. Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.

- que:
  - Is he alive?
  ans:
  - I think so, but I can't get close enough. There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.

- que:
  - You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
  ans:
  - Sure. Any time.

- que:
  - We?
  ans:
  - Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

- que:
  - I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
  ans:
  - Is that good?

- que:
  - What? What?
  ans:
  - Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.

- que:
  - Did you speak to my father?
  ans:
  - Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

- que:
  - You'd say if you mind?
  ans:
  - No, I like him.

- que:
  - Oh darling -- is that for me?
  ans:
  - No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

- que:
  - Who's this?
  ans:
  - It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.

- que:
  - Okay. And did we know each other?
  ans:
  - Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.

- que:
  - Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
  ans:
  - Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

- que:
  - Say again?
  ans:
  - You know, a primer.

- que:
  - Can you mix a martini?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What? What's this?
  ans:
  - I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.

- que:
  - I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
  ans:
  - I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.

- que:
  - You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
  ans:
  - Your parents met her.

- que:
  - I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
  ans:
  - You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.

- que:
  - Could we sail to Venice?
  ans:
  - Sure. I love Venice.

- que:
  - I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York?
  ans:
  - I played piano in a few places.

- que:
  - Well we certainly know that's true.
  ans:
  - I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?

- que:
  - Do you have any brothers?
  ans:
  - No, no brothers, no sisters.

- que:
  - Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
  ans:
  - Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?

- que:
  - What does he say?
  ans:
  - He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.

- que:
  - Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
  ans:
  - Relax.

- que:
  - Freddie?
  ans:
  - Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

- que:
  - Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
  ans:
  - I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...

- que:
  - Shoes too?
  ans:
  - You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.

- que:
  - Get undressed in your own room, would you?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd missed the train.

- que:
  - Is Freddie here?
  ans:
  - He's downstairs.

- que:
  - She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
  ans:
  - I'm prepared to take the blame.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.

- que:
  - What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
  ans:
  - To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Then I'll take it as a compliment.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - So cool.

- que:
  - Marge and I are getting married.
  ans:
  - Really? To Italy?

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.

- que:
  - Do you think you can steer this thing?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Marge-maintenance.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's Freddie. Let me in.

- que:
  - Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - What about Christmas?
  ans:
  - He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.

- que:
  - Hardly.
  ans:
  - How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

- que:
  - Freddie, do you have something to say?
  ans:
  - What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.

- que:
  - Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
  ans:
  - I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.

- que:
  - Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
  ans:
  - Marge has been telling us about the rings.

- que:
  - San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.

- que:
  - Is Mr Greenleaf here?
  ans:
  - Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

- que:
  - I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.

- que:
  - Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
  ans:
  - I hope she never knows.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.

- que:
  - Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
  ans:
  - Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

- que:
  - Frances?
  ans:
  - My fiance.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What about Cortina?
  ans:
  - Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out -- Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

- que:
  - How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.

- que:
  - Where's Dickie?
  ans:
  - I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.

- que:
  - Ha. Did he say why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.

- que:
  - Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
  ans:
  - He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.

- que:
  - How long's he staying for?
  ans:
  - Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

- que:
  - Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
  ans:
  - No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

- que:
  - Is he really not here?
  ans:
  - I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

- que:
  - I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face?
  ans:
  - Dickie did it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Get on. I'll take you to him.

- que:
  - He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
  ans:
  - Where does Dickie live?

- que:
  - Look at me what?
  ans:
  - To the manner born.

- que:
  - Did Dickie's Dad go?
  ans:
  - He's having an early night.

- que:
  - Tom?
  ans:
  - Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.

- que:
  - Why do you have Dickie's rings?
  ans:
  - I told you. He gave them to me.

- que:
  - Why? When?
  ans:
  - I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.

- que:
  - Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
  ans:
  - You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.

- que:
  - How would you know that?
  ans:
  - Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.

- que:
  - Do you know Tom?
  ans:
  - We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.

- que:
  - Where's Dickie's father?
  ans:
  - He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.

- que:
  - Golly. Who's paying for this?
  ans:
  - This is spectacular.

- que:
  - What's funny?
  ans:
  - No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.

- que:
  - You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
  ans:
  - Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

- que:
  - Which is?
  ans:
  - Emily. Just kidding.

- que:
  - As in the...?
  ans:
  - As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.

- que:
  - How did you know that?
  ans:
  - Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

- que:
  - Is Freddie in Rome?
  ans:
  - I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.

- que:
  - I thought you were enjoying yourself?
  ans:
  - Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.

- que:
  - Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
  ans:
  - I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?

- que:
  - Just kidding. Are you alone?
  ans:
  - Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

- que:
  - When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
  ans:
  - I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.

- que:
  - So -- are you travelling under R?
  ans:
  - You know what -- I am.

- que:
  - All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
  ans:
  - He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.

- que:
  - Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
  ans:
  - Are you a homosexual? Interesting non-sequitur.

- que:
  - Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.

- que:
  - Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - Will we see you later?
  ans:
  - I can't later.

- que:
  - Ten thirty?
  ans:
  - We'll be there.

- que:
  - What rumour?
  ans:
  - That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.

- que:
  - Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
  ans:
  - What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He says so many fiances.

- que:
  - Just because he doesn't like Americans!
  ans:
  - But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...

- que:
  - No key, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.

- que:
  - You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Not guilty.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Do you want me to stick around?
  ans:
  - It's okay.

- que:
  - Tom, are you okay?
  ans:
  - You try. You try talking to her.

- que:
  - Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
  ans:
  - I give up.

- que:
  - What do you want to change about this moment?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Hello. What are you up to?
  ans:
  - All kinds of things. Making plans.

- que:
  - Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.

- que:
  - How was it?
  ans:
  - Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.

- que:
  - Was who Meredith?
  ans:
  - Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.

- que:
  - Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Or Tom and Peter even.

- que:
  - What do you mean lied about who you are?
  ans:
  - I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.

- que:
  - I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
  ans:
  - Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.

- que:
  - Postmortem?
  ans:
  - Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.

- que:
  - Of course. What happened to your face?
  ans:
  - My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.

- que:
  - The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
  ans:
  - Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance.

- que:
  - Even your fiance...?
  ans:
  - Even her.

- que:
  - What about Ripley?
  ans:
  - Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.

- que:
  - Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
  ans:
  - November 7th is my information.

- que:
  - And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
  ans:
  - A few days ago.

- que:
  - Thank you.
  ans:
  - Does he stay with you here?

- que:
  - Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
  ans:
  - I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.

- que:
  - You got a .44 Magnum?
  ans:
  - That's an expensive gun.

- que:
  - How much to get a permit to carry?
  ans:
  - Nah, this'll be fine.

- que:
  - Is there a firing range around?
  ans:
  - Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.

- que:
  - Who mam?
  ans:
  - Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.

- que:
  - You want to canvass?
  ans:
  - Yes, mam.

- que:
  - Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
  ans:
  - If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - My name is Travis.

- que:
  - Where do you live?
  ans:
  - Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.

- que:
  - So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
  ans:
  - After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.

- que:
  - What kind of people?
  ans:
  - Just people people, you know. Just people. Had a dead man once.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said \"West 45th Street\" and conked out.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.

- que:
  - The moon?
  ans:
  - The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Late one night. About three. At the plaza.

- que:
  - The DMZ?
  ans:
  - That would have been quite a coincidence.

- que:
  - What hours do you work?
  ans:
  - I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said \"Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction\".

- que:
  - The singer?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.

- que:
  - Travis, you haven't even played the record?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.

- que:
  - So you haven't heard this record yet?
  ans:
  - No. I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I bought a couple of tickets.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm leaving.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - These are not the kind of movies I go to.

- que:
  - You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
  ans:
  - This is sort of high class...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.

- que:
  - What about the record?
  ans:
  - Keep it.

- que:
  - Can I call you?
  ans:
  - Hello, Travis.

- que:
  - Travis?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
  ans:
  - I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.

- que:
  - Just didn't get around to it, huh?
  ans:
  - Oh, Tom, please.

- que:
  - Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
  ans:
  - More people watch it.

- que:
  - Just what?
  ans:
  - Kidding around... you know, fun.

- que:
  - Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
  ans:
  - Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?

- que:
  - What taxi driver?
  ans:
  - That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.

- que:
  - How long has he been there?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.

- que:
  - This is gotta be a game, right?
  ans:
  - As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.

- que:
  - With the other hand, right?
  ans:
  - No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.

- que:
  - Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
  ans:
  - What is your name? My name is Travis.

- que:
  - Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
  ans:
  - We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.

- que:
  - Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think! What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - And what happened?
  ans:
  - She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.

- que:
  - You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
  ans:
  - Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.

- que:
  - What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
  ans:
  - Support my kids. Can you dig it? Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me.

- que:
  - One-Ball McCall?
  ans:
  - Fuckin' One-Ball.

- que:
  - Stick up?
  ans:
  - No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

- que:
  - I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
  ans:
  - I have.

- que:
  - You carry a piece? You need one?
  ans:
  - Nah. I suppose not.

- que:
  - 20 bucks?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.

- que:
  - You looking for some action?
  ans:
  - Well... I guess so.

- que:
  - Why you hang around with them greasers?
  ans:
  - A girl needs protection.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Easy.

- que:
  - What's your real name?
  ans:
  - I don't like my real name.

- que:
  - What's your real name?
  ans:
  - Iris.

- que:
  - I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
  ans:
  - I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.

- que:
  - Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
  ans:
  - Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.

- que:
  - Do they drug you?
  ans:
  - Oh, come off it, man.

- que:
  - You can do it in my mouth.
  ans:
  - Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it?

- que:
  - Do you understand why I came here?
  ans:
  - I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.

- que:
  - Don't you want to go?
  ans:
  - I can leave anytime I want.

- que:
  - But that one night?
  ans:
  - I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.

- que:
  - Can I see you again?
  ans:
  - That's not hard to do.

- que:
  - Well, you want to or not?
  ans:
  - O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Pittsburgh.

- que:
  - Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
  ans:
  - God, you are square.

- que:
  - Who's a killer?
  ans:
  - That fella \"Sport\" looks like a killer to me.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.

- que:
  - Why don't you come to a commune with me?
  ans:
  - Me? I could never go to a place like that.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I... I don't get along with people like that.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I've got something important to do. I can't leave.

- que:

  - What is happening? Where's Mason?
  ans:
  - He says he's leaving the island sir.

- que:
  - During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?

  ans:
  - It's about time.

- que:
  - Partners?
  ans:
  - Partners.

- que:
  - You knew? All this time?
  ans:
  - I'm not a fool, Billy.

- que:
  - What's that? Mason?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. Yes, he was.

- que:
  - But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
  ans:
  - But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?

- que:
  - What about you, Delly?
  ans:
  - I am, too.

- que:
  - You'll stand by me?
  ans:
  - Whatever happens.

- que:
  - You've got everything?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.

- que:
  - And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
  ans:
  - Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...

- que:
  - Did you bring along something to read?
  ans:
  - Damn...

- que:
  - Okay. What's the second thing?
  ans:
  - Delly? In here.

- que:
  - How'd it go?
  ans:
  - Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.

- que:
  - That always used to work.
  ans:
  - That's my girl! Did you...?

- que:
  - Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - You mean, me?
  ans:
  - It's possible.

- que:
  - Do you... remember me?
  ans:
  - I've seen you before. Your picture...

- que:
  - I do?
  ans:
  - Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.

- que:
  - City hall?
  ans:
  - You must not remember anything. Come on.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.

- que:
  - How'd they get it inside?
  ans:
  - Through the door. It comes apart.

- que:
  - And why not?
  ans:
  - Whoa.

- que:
  - Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
  ans:
  - You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.

- que:
  - You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
  ans:
  - Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Were we going to get married?
  ans:
  - Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.

- que:
  - What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
  ans:
  - Well, there's got to be a way...

- que:
  - I don't smoke?
  ans:
  - You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.

- que:
  - My what?
  ans:
  - Huh. That was nice of me.

- que:
  - How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
  ans:
  - Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.

- que:
  - What... do you remember?
  ans:
  - Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.

- que:
  - Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
  ans:
  - And what is the state of your memory now?

- que:
  - Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
  ans:
  - Start with what you knew then.

- que:
  - Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
  ans:
  - Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...

- que:
  - All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
  ans:
  - Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...

- que:
  - Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
  ans:
  - I'm not refuting anything.

- que:
  - Well, then, as what did you go?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - A statement?
  ans:
  - Yes. A prepared statement.

- que:
  - Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton?
  ans:
  - I... I need a drink of water.

- que:
  - Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
  ans:
  - Listen to me! The young man in there...

- que:
  - Ben, when's Delly due back?
  ans:
  - Here we are.

- que:
  - No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
  ans:
  - Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.

- que:
  - You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
  ans:
  - No. But...

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.

- que:
  - C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
  ans:
  - What's that?

- que:
  - The Bijou?
  ans:
  - Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...

- que:
  - That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
  ans:
  - The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.

- que:
  - Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
  ans:
  - Harry, son. Harry.

- que:
  - And... what's my name again?
  ans:
  - Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been \"Luke\" since you were a baby.

- que:
  - When did I leave?
  ans:
  - You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.

- que:
  - Didn't you have any help?
  ans:
  - That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.

- que:
  - Who... are they?
  ans:
  - This is the staff of the Bijou.

- que:
  - Oh. What... what time is it?
  ans:
  - Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.

- que:
  - Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
  ans:
  - No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
  ans:
  - But I...

- que:
  - Why don't you two get out there and dance?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, I...

- que:
  - Beautiful, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.

- que:
  - Did I what?
  ans:
  - Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.

- que:
  - Anybody take it?
  ans:
  - A few.

- que:
  - Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?
  ans:
  - Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.

- que:
  - The G-man?
  ans:
  - Zackly.

- que:
  - Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
  ans:
  - This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.

- que:
  - Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
  ans:
  - Sandra Sinclair.

- que:
  - Any idea how you got here, son?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
  ans:
  - I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.

- que:
  - And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
  ans:
  - I... no, I... I just can't...

- que:
  - That's where you live.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - We live in a theater?
  ans:
  - Evening, Luke.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...

- que:
  - Aren't you coming?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not much of a dancer.

- que:
  - Can we get him to the hospital?
  ans:
  - Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - You smell gas?
  ans:
  - Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.

- que:
  - You think he's drunk somewhere?
  ans:
  - Wouldn't blame him if he was.

- que:
  - What's his rent?
  ans:
  - Thirty a month.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Take a hike. Am-scray.

- que:
  - Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
  ans:
  - I... I don't believe this.

- que:
  - What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
  ans:
  - They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, that's enough.

- que:
  - I'm not sorry for what I said.
  ans:
  - Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?

- que:
  - Cigarette?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - When'd you quit smoking?
  ans:
  - Luke didn't smoke.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.

- que:
  - What, all of a sudden, \"Lucille Angstrom\" isn't a name?
  ans:
  - Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.

- que:
  - Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
  ans:
  - I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.

- que:
  - When was that?
  ans:
  - Nineteen-oh-nine.

- que:
  - I can play the piano?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
  ans:
  - Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.

- que:
  - We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
  ans:
  - Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.

- que:
  - Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
  ans:
  - I thought you...

- que:
  - Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
  ans:
  - You bet, honey.

- que:
  - What exactly did you hear?
  ans:
  - That you got let go.

- que:
  - He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?
  ans:
  - Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.

- que:
  - You mean, he was... let go, too?
  ans:
  - They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.

- que:
  - Will you help me, Sandy?
  ans:
  - I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...

- que:
  - Ancestors?
  ans:
  - Actually, my grandpap. But \"ancestors\" sounds better, don't it? Here.

- que:
  - Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it?
  ans:
  - Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.

- que:
  - You hungry, son?
  ans:
  - Yes. Very.

- que:
  - Got any money?
  ans:
  - Thank you, Mr. Lawson.

- que:
  - Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
  ans:
  - I already have.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - My girlfriend. If she still is...

- que:
  - Would that be Miss Sinclair?
  ans:
  - No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.

- que:
  - Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way. Sir, are you a communist?
  ans:
  - No. Absolutely not.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.

- que:
  - The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
  ans:
  - That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

- que:
  - Are you a friend of Mitch's?
  ans:
  - No, not really.

- que:
  - Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time. There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay. Did you plan on staying long?
  ans:
  - No. Just a few hours.

- que:
  - You're leaving after you see Cathy?
  ans:
  - Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.

- que:
  - Did you drive up from San Francisco?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do I? No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid. Or maybe a closed one. Pretty. What are they?
  ans:
  - Lovebirds.

- que:
  - Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did.

- que:
  - That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...

- que:
  - Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car?
  ans:
  - It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.

- que:
  - Miss Daniels? Is that you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
  ans:
  - No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.

- que:
  - Would you like some brandy?
  ans:
  - If you have some, I'd...

- que:
  - No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - Or would you rather I changed the subject?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - How do you like our little hamlet?
  ans:
  - I despise it.

- que:
  - Where are you from originally, Annie?
  ans:
  - San Francisco.

- que:
  - How'd you happen to come here?
  ans:
  - Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.

- que:
  - When was this?
  ans:
  - Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.

- que:
  - With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
  ans:
  - A trifle.

- que:
  - Then what was it?
  ans:
  - Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.

- que:
  - Then why did she object to you?
  ans:
  - Because she was afraid.

- que:
  - Afraid you'd take Mitch?
  ans:
  - Afraid I'd give Mitch.

- que:
  - What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - You get straight to the point, don't you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. Forgive me.

- que:
  - And the second?
  ans:
  - He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.

- que:
  - Do you think I should go?
  ans:
  - That's up to you.

- que:
  - Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is anyone there?
  ans:
  - Look.

- que:
  - No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
  ans:
  - Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.

- que:
  - Take them.
  ans:
  - Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.

- que:
  - Is smoking fun?
  ans:
  - Oh, I suppose so.

- que:
  - Could I have a puff?
  ans:
  - I don't think your mother would like that.

- que:
  - Are you coming to my party?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.

- que:
  - Don't you like Bodega Bay?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet.

- que:
  - Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
  ans:
  - She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.

- que:
  - What's the matter with them?
  ans:
  - We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.

- que:
  - Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
  ans:
  - Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.

- que:
  - Why are they trying to kill people?
  ans:
  - Mitch, let's turn back.

- que:
  - Mitch? Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
  ans:
  - I think they'll be all right, honey.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The little Brenner girl.

- que:
  - Do you know him?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Where does he live?
  ans:
  - Right here. Bodega Bay.

- que:
  - Yes, but where?
  ans:
  - Right across the bay there.

- que:
  - And the white house?
  ans:
  - That's where the Brenners live.

- que:
  - The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
  ans:
  - Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

- que:
  - The two kids?
  ans:
  - Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

- que:
  - I see. How do I get down there?
  ans:
  - Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.

- que:
  - The front door. Isn't there a back road I can take?
  ans:
  - Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.

- que:
  - Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - D'you want me to order one for you?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - What name?
  ans:
  - Daniels.

- que:
  - Yep?
  ans:
  - The little girl's name.

- que:
  - The little Brenner girl?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - How much for the phone calls?
  ans:
  - It's nothing.

- que:
  - Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
  ans:
  - Young woman cut herself.

- que:
  - You cut yourself outside, Miss?
  ans:
  - Let me have some apple pie, Helen. Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...

- que:
  - One apple pie! You want more coffee?
  ans:
  - No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.

- que:
  - Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
  ans:
  - No. Here's fine.

- que:
  - I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
  ans:
  - I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

- que:
  - How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what?
  ans:
  - A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.

- que:
  - For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
  ans:
  - Across at Brinkmeyer's.

- que:
  - You did say birds?
  ans:
  - Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

- que:
  - I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
  ans:
  - There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

- que:
  - He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
  ans:
  - Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.

- que:
  - Whose side are you on?
  ans:
  - I'm simply quoting the law.

- que:
  - She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
  ans:
  - Yes, very.

- que:
  - How long have you known her?
  ans:
  - I told you. We met yesterday.

- que:
  - Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. She's very rich, isn't she?
  ans:
  - I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.

- que:
  - She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mother.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.

- que:
  - Well... well, is everyone all right?
  ans:
  - I think he got a little scratch, Mother.

- que:
  - Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
  ans:
  - I got them all, Mother.

- que:
  - When do you think they'll come?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - I don't know when. We'll see what...

- que:
  - Where will we go?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in.

- que:
  - What happens when we run out of wood?
  ans:
  - I don't know. We'll break up the furni...

- que:
  - You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
  ans:
  - Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...

- que:
  - If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
  ans:
  - They won't be.

- que:
  - If they are?
  ans:
  - We'll worry about that when we get there.

- que:
  - Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
  ans:
  - No, not exactly.

- que:
  - Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
  ans:
  - No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.

- que:
  - Where's Mitch?
  ans:
  - Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.

- que:
  - Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
  ans:
  - He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Cathy. At the school.

- que:
  - Do I sound foolish to you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
  ans:
  - Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.

- que:
  - And if you don't?
  ans:
  - Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.

- que:
  - Would you like me to go for her?
  ans:
  - I couldn't ask you to.

- que:
  - Did you close the door?
  ans:
  - And locked it.

- que:
  - I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
  ans:
  - Well... Well... these birds attacked us.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?
  ans:
  - Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...

- que:
  - Does this room look silly?
  ans:
  - Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...

- que:
  - Is that for Mitch Brenner?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
  ans:
  - Well, I...

- que:
  - Well, where did he go?
  ans:
  - Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.

- que:
  - Bodega Bay? Where's that?
  ans:
  - Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I said I wonder if you could help me.

- que:
  - Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
  ans:
  - Lovebirds.

- que:
  - Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
  ans:
  - Well... yes, sir, there are.

- que:
  - Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
  ans:
  - I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.

- que:
  - Aren't these lovebirds?
  ans:
  - No, sir, those are... redbirds.

- que:
  - All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
  ans:
  - Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.

- que:
  - I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
  ans:
  - Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.

- que:
  - Are they moulting now?
  ans:
  - Some of them are.

- que:
  - How can you tell?
  ans:
  - Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.

- que:
  - But how... how do you know my name?
  ans:
  - A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - We met in court.

- que:
  - What are you? A policeman?
  ans:
  - I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.

- que:
  - What kind of law?
  ans:
  - Criminal.

- que:
  - Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
  ans:
  - To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
  ans:
  - Why...

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Annie. Annie Hayworth.

- que:
  - How do you know Annie?
  ans:
  - We... we went to school together. College.

- que:
  - Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
  ans:
  - Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.

- que:
  - It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
  ans:
  - I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?

- que:
  - So you came up to see Annie, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why would I want to see you, of all people?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...

- que:
  - You like me, huh?
  ans:
  - I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.

- que:
  - None of your business. Am I still bleeding?
  ans:
  - Can't see a thing.

- que:
  - Yes, but...
  ans:
  - But you were coming up anyway, remember?

- que:
  - You are, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Certainly, but...

- que:
  - Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
  ans:
  - With... with Annie, of course.

- que:
  - Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
  ans:
  - Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.

- que:
  - You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - Famished.

- que:
  - Why did he shoot her?
  ans:
  - He was watching a ball game on television.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - His wife changed the channel.

- que:
  - You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - Will I be seeing you again?
  ans:
  - San Francisco's a long way from here.

- que:
  - How does Mother know what I like to do?
  ans:
  - I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.

- que:
  - Without any clothes on?
  ans:
  - With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...

- que:
  - You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...

- que:
  - ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.

- que:
  - Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
  ans:
  - No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.

- que:
  - Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
  ans:
  - I wrote the letter.

- que:
  - What did it say?
  ans:
  - It said, \"Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality.\" That's what it said.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I think it could be fun.

- que:
  - Cheers.
  ans:
  - What do you want ?

- que:
  - Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
  ans:
  - Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.

- que:
  - You have a job?
  ans:
  - I have several jobs.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I do different things on different days.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.

- que:
  - And Fridays? What do you do then?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.

- que:
  - What'll it say?
  ans:
  - You'll think me very bold, sir.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
  ans:
  - No, I have my things in the car.

- que:
  - Do you want some mustard with this?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - Some cream?
  ans:
  - I'll get it.

- que:
  - I think I should, don't you?
  ans:
  - It smelled of the fire.

- que:
  - Of birds?
  ans:
  - Certainly, of birds.

- que:
  - Mmm?
  ans:
  - With my little sparrow leading team.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - After the gulls attacked.

- que:
  - I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
  ans:
  - At Annie's house. She's all right.

- que:
  - How long have they been gathering there?
  ans:
  - The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.

- que:
  - Do you want to try your father again?
  ans:
  - I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.

- que:
  - Have we still got power?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.

- que:
  - Where are they heading?
  ans:
  - Inland.

- que:
  - Santa Rosa?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - When will they stop?
  ans:
  - I thought they'd have stopped by now.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Almost two a.m.

- que:
  - How about you?
  ans:
  - You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

- que:
  - Can we turn back?
  ans:
  - I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.

- que:
  - Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
  ans:
  - Hello, Miss Daniels.

- que:
  - What do you suppose it is?
  ans:
  - I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

- que:
  - Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
  ans:
  - Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.

- que:
  - And he'll talk?
  ans:
  - Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.

- que:
  - Yes. Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
  ans:
  - I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.

- que:
  - I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
  ans:
  - Well, all right, but...

- que:
  - That... that... who was that?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - Have you got a pencil?
  ans:
  - What? Oh, yes, certainly.

- que:
  - No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
  ans:
  - Yes, certainly.

- que:
  - Do you have any lovebirds?
  ans:
  - No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.

- que:
  - Thank you. Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
  ans:
  - I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...

- que:
  - What do you think they were after, Miss...?
  ans:
  - Daniels. I think they were after the children.

- que:
  - For what purpose?
  ans:
  - Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...

- que:
  - Maybe! Is it impossible?
  ans:
  - Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

- que:
  - Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
  ans:
  - No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.

- que:
  - It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
  ans:
  - I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...

- que:
  - Help how? What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure, but...

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.

- que:
  - How do you plan to do that?
  ans:
  - With smoke.

- que:
  - Can we go on living here otherwise?
  ans:
  - Scotch, light on the water.

- que:
  - Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
  ans:
  - We need them.

- que:
  - How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
  ans:
  - Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.

- que:
  - Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
  ans:
  - Take it easy, lady. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

- que:
  - I'm leaving! Are you coming?
  ans:
  - All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks.

- que:
  - Mr. Gray?
  ans:
  - That's right. Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.

- que:
  - But can't you give me any idea?
  ans:
  - How could I? I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.

- que:
  - You asked to see me, ma'am?
  ans:
  - I want you to help my little girl.

- que:
  - Did he tell you about Georgina?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean it that way. I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.

- que:
  - You have his promise, then?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
  ans:
  - You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.

- que:
  - Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
  ans:
  - I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.

- que:
  - And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - Where can I find him?
  ans:
  - You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.

- que:
  - I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
  ans:
  - Well? And are you not a good student?

- que:
  - And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
  ans:
  - Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.

- que:
  - Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
  ans:
  - I remember her.

- que:
  - I just saw Gray. What was he laughing at?
  ans:
  - He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.

- que:
  - What do you mean, Fettes?
  ans:
  - I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.

- que:
  - What's that you say?
  ans:
  - Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel? I've had some practice in the art.

- que:
  - Where shall we put it? In the back?
  ans:
  - No room there. We'll have to set it between us.

- que:
  - Are you a doctor, too?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
  ans:
  - The white horse. The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.

- que:
  - Why do you want the white horse to bid you \"good-day\"?
  ans:
  - He was a nice horse.

- que:
  - Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
  ans:
  - Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina? You can't find him from a wheelchair. You have to walk and run to find him.

- que:
  - I will not have you use that name to me.
  ans:
  - A doctor?

- que:
  - You will not have it?
  ans:
  - You're a teacher, eh? Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.

- que:
  - Afraid of what?
  ans:
  - Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.

- que:
  - You? Why? Since when have you become the protector of little children?
  ans:
  - I'll not do it, Gray.

- que:
  - Hear him? Did you ever see the lads play knife?
  ans:
  - Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy. Not at all friendly.

- que:
  - Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
  ans:
  - The heart pumps it.

- que:
  - But what makes a thought start?
  ans:
  - In the brain, I tell you. I know.

- que:
  - Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
  ans:
  - I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.

- que:
  - So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
  ans:
  - I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.

- que:
  - Would you bribe me to leave you be?
  ans:
  - I would make you rich.

- que:
  - But why, Gray? Why?
  ans:
  - Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.

- que:
  - A pleasure to torment me?
  ans:
  - I presume you shall. This won't be my last visit here.

- que:
  - Can anyone hear what we say?
  ans:
  - Only Brother.

- que:
  - I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
  ans:
  - No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.

- que:
  - That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
  ans:
  - But where did they get those people?

- que:
  - I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they \"Burked\" them.
  ans:
  - We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?

- que:
  - How long after that was the paralysis complete?
  ans:
  - Nearly a year.

- que:
  - Any attacks of pain since?
  ans:
  - Yes, Doctor.

- que:
  - Is her pain sporadic or constant?
  ans:
  - It comes at intervals. They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent -- much more frequent.

- que:
  - Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
  ans:
  - A carriage overturned. My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.

- que:
  - How long ago?
  ans:
  - Three years.

- que:
  - I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
  ans:
  - But can anything be done for her?

- que:
  - There's nothing I can say for one small child?
  ans:
  - But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.

- que:
  - Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
  ans:
  - You're daft. What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.

- que:
  - You can get out.
  ans:
  - No great lady will ever take my place?

- que:
  - Fettes -- where is Fettes?
  ans:
  - I'll get him.

- que:
  - Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
  ans:
  - Where are they? Last chance.

- que:
  - around, or whatever the hell you're doing here. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for my friends.

- que:
  - How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
  ans:
  - You sent them. I had no choice.

- que:
  - Yeah? I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
  ans:
  - Was that it? Well, ok.

- que:
  - What do they do that they had to kill her?
  ans:
  - I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.

- que:
  - I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
  ans:
  - Where is it? This place?

- que:
  - Think maybe knives do?
  ans:
  - Keep that thing away from me.

- que:
  - Fuck! What do you want?
  ans:
  - A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.

- que:
  - Where the fuck did you come from?
  ans:
  - You lied at my trial.

- que:
  - What did they give you?
  ans:
  - AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.

- que:
  - Not my arm! What you fucking want?
  ans:
  - I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.

- que:
  - The scar. Which of you has it?
  ans:
  - Nobody.

- que:
  - How can you die if you're already dead?
  ans:
  - You're him. Corvis.

- que:
  - And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face?
  ans:
  - Someone else did it.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I told you, I knew your sister.

- que:
  - No! Why are you haunting me?
  ans:
  - Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.

- que:
  - Are you ok?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - So you're going to kill him?
  ans:
  - Have to find him first.

- que:
  - Erin. Who?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I found him lying there.

- que:
  - Guy dressed for Halloween?
  ans:
  - Good for you. You do know something.

- que:
  - How about sign of a big black bird?
  ans:
  - The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.

- que:
  - You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
  ans:
  - Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.

- que:
  - Anything wrong?
  ans:
  - Let's hope not. License and registration please.

- que:
  - What's with your friend there?
  ans:
  - She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.

- que:
  - If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
  ans:
  - Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.

- que:
  - You want me to walk a straight line?
  ans:
  - I want you... to bend over.

- que:
  - Why are there so many?
  ans:
  - This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.

- que:
  - What? What is it?
  ans:
  - Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

- que:
  - What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
  ans:
  - I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.

- que:
  - Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
  ans:
  - He'll be there at 8,30.

- que:
  - That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
  ans:
  - Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?

- que:
  - You wrote this?
  ans:
  - It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see. I thought you'd have the solution by this time.

- que:
  - Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
  ans:
  - Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.

- que:
  - How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
  ans:
  - I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another. I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.

- que:
  - Would you care to be more specific?
  ans:
  - What I have to say must be said to all concerned. It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.

- que:
  - What -- what sort of action do you mean?
  ans:
  - That's what I came to see you about.

- que:
  - You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
  ans:
  - No -- not at all.

- que:
  - What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
  ans:
  - My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.

- que:
  - One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be-- --eliminated.

- que:
  - Such power exists?
  ans:
  - I assure you such power exists.

- que:
  - Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
  ans:
  - Yes -- of course.

- que:
  - Something dramatic -- but not destructive. It's quite an interesting problem. Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
  ans:
  - Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.

- que:
  - Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
  ans:
  - Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.

- que:
  - Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
  ans:
  - I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.

- que:
  - Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Of course, dear.

- que:
  - Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
  ans:
  - Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.

- que:
  - You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
  ans:
  - Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?

- que:
  - He gave these to you?
  ans:
  - Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.

- que:
  - Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
  ans:
  - Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.

- que:
  - Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
  ans:
  - Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

- que:
  - Are you an FBI man?
  ans:
  - No -- I'm afraid not.

- que:
  - Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
  ans:
  - Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.

- que:
  - He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
  ans:
  - Sure. Right near where my mother works.

- que:
  - Where is that?
  ans:
  - Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.

- que:
  - Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
  ans:
  - Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

- que:
  - You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I think so.

- que:
  - You think they'll ever find him?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.

- que:
  - Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
  ans:
  - Velocity is the time rate of change of position.

- que:
  - Wouldn't you like to meet him?
  ans:
  - Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

- que:
  - Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
  ans:
  - No -- I'm afraid not.

- que:
  - Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
  ans:
  - They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.

- que:
  - Certainly. Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
  ans:
  - I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.

- que:
  - Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
  ans:
  - No -- I want to take you to the movies. Do you think they'd accept these?

- que:
  - Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
  ans:
  - Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?

- que:
  - Why not, Bobby?
  ans:
  - She doesn't like me to steal from people.

- que:
  - Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
  ans:
  - Yeah -- sure. It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

- que:
  - What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
  ans:
  - Why -- the light in my room went out. Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

- que:
  - And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure. How old do you think he is?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'd say forty-five.

- que:
  - How does he explain that?
  ans:
  - He says their medicine is that much more advanced. He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.

- que:
  - I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise. Had you been traveling long?
  ans:
  - About five months -- your months.

- que:
  - The present situation?
  ans:
  - I mean the reasons for my coming here.

- que:
  - We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
  ans:
  - I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone.

- que:
  - You know about the United Nations?
  ans:
  - We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.

- que:
  - Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
  ans:
  - Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.

- que:
  - Thank you... Have you any news?
  ans:
  - It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.

- que:
  - You ready?
  ans:
  - I will be in just a minute.

- que:
  - Is it real?
  ans:
  - Looks real to me.

- que:
  - You think it's all right for you to stay here?
  ans:
  - I've got a good lock on my door. And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.

- que:
  - Are you crazy? After what happened today?
  ans:
  - You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.

- que:
  - Is that what you're thinking about?
  ans:
  - Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.

- que:
  - Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
  ans:
  - I -- I was Just going to lunch.

- que:
  - Yes--?
  ans:
  - I want to know what he told you last night.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Just twelve.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.

- que:
  - No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
  ans:
  - Where are you going now?

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.

- que:
  - Where is the meeting going to be?
  ans:
  - At the ship.

- que:
  - Gort? But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
  ans:
  - \"Klaatu barada nikto.\"

- que:
  - You mean he has the power of life and death?
  ans:
  - No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.

- que:
  - But how -- how long--?
  ans:
  - How long will I live? That no one can say.

- que:
  - How dare you write on that blackboard! Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
  ans:
  - He'll catch on to it in no time now.

- que:
  - How did you get in here? And what do you want?
  ans:
  - We came to see Professor Barnhardt.

- que:
  - I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
  ans:
  - That's what I wanted you to tell me.

- que:
  - Would you like to sell it?
  ans:
  - No -- no, thanks.

- que:
  - Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
  ans:
  - No -- I'm afraid not.

- que:
  - Well, how do I know who you are?
  ans:
  - You don't.

- que:
  - They would have killed this man?
  ans:
  - People get hysterical enough, they do anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.

- que:
  - How long will that take?
  ans:
  - They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. Take him over to G2.

- que:
  - Just passing through Santa Carla?
  ans:
  - I don't like horror comics.

- que:
  - How do you like Santa Carla?
  ans:
  - It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.

- que:
  - Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
  ans:
  - This isn't a comic book store, right. It's a bakery.

- que:
  - Can't stand light?
  ans:
  - Wears sunglasses in the house.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - He's my brother.

- que:
  - Time to activate Plan B.
  ans:
  - Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?

- que:
  - What's Plan B?
  ans:
  - We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.

- que:
  - All together?
  ans:
  - Zero.

- que:
  - Okay. Where's Nosferatu?
  ans:
  - The Prince of Darkness.

- que:
  - Four to go.
  ans:
  - Should I run him through?

- que:
  - Whattaya mean?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
  ans:
  - What?...

- que:
  - Get your bike. We're going someplace.
  ans:
  - You're eating maggots. How do they taste?

- que:
  - If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
  ans:
  - What's going' on?

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - For a ride.

- que:
  - With him?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where the hell are you from, Kryton?
  ans:
  - Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...

- que:
  - Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
  ans:
  - You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you? Well, you don't know shit, buddy.

- que:
  - Bad breath? Long fingernails?
  ans:
  - His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.

- que:
  - How do you know they're not?
  ans:
  - He's not glowing.

- que:
  - He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael?
  ans:
  - To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.

- que:
  - What's that smell!?
  ans:
  - Vampires, my friend. Vampires.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There's a cop behind us.

- que:
  - What happens in tow and a half hours?
  ans:
  - The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.

- que:
  - I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
  ans:
  - I'll take you there.

- que:
  - Smells good. When do we eat?
  ans:
  - I told Max eight o'clock.

- que:
  - Max? You men we're having company again?
  ans:
  - Again'? Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.

- que:
  - You have a T.V.?
  ans:
  - Great. I wanna get some new comics.

- que:
  - Are we havin' fun or what?
  ans:
  - I thought we were goin' into town.

- que:
  - Did we have a date tonight?
  ans:
  - I guess so. She said not to be late.

- que:
  - Who, Laddie?
  ans:
  - Laddie... you can still remember. You can still remember home.

- que:
  - You didn't tell David?
  ans:
  - No. Just you.

- que:
  - Still mad at me?
  ans:
  - For what.

- que:
  - It's early. Why do we have to go home?
  ans:
  - Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.

- que:
  - Michael, are you still in bed?
  ans:
  - No. I'm up.

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
  ans:
  - We are...

- que:
  - Not that poor.
  ans:
  - What's that smell?

- que:
  - You've heard this story before?
  ans:
  - So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.

- que:
  - Can we get a T.V.?
  ans:
  - Lights out, Sam.

- que:
  - Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
  ans:
  - What's wrong? Tell me.

- que:
  - Where's Michael?
  ans:
  - He's already gone to bed.

- que:
  - In here?
  ans:
  - Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.

- que:
  - Oh, no. Now what?
  ans:
  - Must be a circuit breaker.

- que:
  - -- a job.
  ans:
  - What did you say?

- que:
  - Do I look that needy?
  ans:
  - Say hello to Thorn.

- que:
  - Not impressed, are you?
  ans:
  - Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.

- que:
  - But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
  ans:
  - I hear this is the decade for cute.

- que:
  - Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
  ans:
  - It's garlic!! I like garlic, but...

- que:
  - Something the matter?
  ans:
  - No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.

- que:
  - I thought you said they needed discipline?
  ans:
  - Well... what do I know? I'm a bachelor. Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.

- que:
  - Max... what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. One big happy family. My boys... and yours.

- que:
  - How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
  ans:
  - Okay, Sam. Thanks.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend.

- que:
  - Are you following me?
  ans:
  - Well, I...

- que:
  - Did you want to talk to me?
  ans:
  - Well... yeah. Sure.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Star.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something. But Star's great. I like Star.

- que:
  - Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tonight. At the boardwalk...

- que:
  - I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I love you...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Save Laddie first.

- que:
  - They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
  ans:
  - They'll be coming for all of us.

- que:
  - Will you give Mom a break?
  ans:
  - Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Nowhere.

- que:
  - What would that make Mom?
  ans:
  - You're right... not even to mention you and me.

- que:
  - No. Why?
  ans:
  - The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.

- que:
  - Wanna go to the comic book store?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Michael?
  ans:
  - Don't turn on the light.

- que:
  - What happened, Michael!?
  ans:
  - Nanook...

- que:
  - What about Mom?
  ans:
  - No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.

- que:
  - It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Who are you calling?
  ans:
  - The Marines.

- que:
  - I... I don't feel any differently. Do you?
  ans:
  - Sixteen.

- que:
  - What do you want from us?
  ans:
  - Just listen.

- que:
  - Where these tracks headed?
  ans:
  - Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.

- que:
  - What do you mean \"got\" to the dog?
  ans:
  - It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.

- que:
  - That night?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What was he doing in the rec room?
  ans:
  - Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone.

- que:
  - Well, where was he? Where did he go?
  ans:
  - Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.

- que:
  - How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
  ans:
  - Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...

- que:
  - What the hell you looking at me like that for?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Nothing at all.

- que:
  - Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
  ans:
  - I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.

- que:
  - Sure. You think there's a connection?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - So what's our problem?
  ans:
  - Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.

- que:
  - Anybody sick?
  ans:
  - No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...

- que:
  - Finish what?
  ans:
  - ... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.

- que:
  - Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
  ans:
  - Now why'd you go and...

- que:
  - You promise?
  ans:
  - I don't know who to trust.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.

- que:
  - Have you come across Fuchs?
  ans:
  - Don't walk behind me.

- que:
  - What's it going to do, being a plant?
  ans:
  - We got to burn 'em.

- que:
  - Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
  ans:
  - I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But...

- que:
  - That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
  ans:
  - Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.

- que:
  - Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
  ans:
  - Childs! That a fuse?

- que:
  - Cut him loose?
  ans:
  - When we were up poking around his place... I found this...

- que:
  - ... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
  ans:
  - What's happening?

- que:
  - Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
  ans:
  - I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.

- que:
  - You buy any of this, Blair?
  ans:
  - I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.

- que:
  - Where's the other half?
  ans:
  - We got morphine, don't we.

- que:
  - What clothes?
  ans:
  - You been made, MacReady.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - For your health.

- que:
  - So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
  ans:
  - If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it. You play chess?

- que:
  - My God, what in hell happened here?
  ans:
  - All in Norwegian.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.

- que:
  - Well, who's got access to it?
  ans:
  - I guess I'm the only one.

- que:
  - Would that test have worked?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it?
  ans:
  - Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...

- que:
  - How long will it take you to prepare this?
  ans:
  - A couple of hours.

- que:
  - Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
  ans:
  - A serum test possibly.

- que:
  - When was the last time you used it?
  ans:
  - A day or so ago... I guess.

- que:
  - How far's that?
  ans:
  - Bout eighty kilos southwest.

- que:
  - How many in their party?
  ans:
  - Started with six. There'd be four others left.

- que:
  - You reach anybody yet?
  ans:
  - We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man. It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.

- que:
  - You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
  ans:
  - I am going after them.

- que:
  - Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
  ans:
  - Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...

- que:
  - Could anyone have gotten it from you?
  ans:
  - Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up.

- que:
  - How long's it been?
  ans:
  - What's...

- que:
  - No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there?
  ans:
  - Move it, Palmer.

- que:
  - We going to make it?
  ans:
  - Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is...

- que:
  - What kind of test?
  ans:
  - I'm sure a lot of you already know.

- que:
  - Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you?
  ans:
  - We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...

- que:
  - What if it doesn't come?
  ans:
  - It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate... Give me a hand.

- que:
  - This storm do that?
  ans:
  - Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Everything that's been missing.

- que:
  - Where was he trying to go?
  ans:
  - Anyplace but here.

- que:
  - What about Childs?
  ans:
  - Forget about Childs. He's over.

- que:
  - You crazy? He might be inside already?
  ans:
  - Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.

- que:
  - We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
  ans:
  - Get your gear on.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy. And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.

- que:
  - So what do you make of it?
  ans:
  - You know damn well what we both make of it.

- que:
  - No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
  ans:
  - Somebody else sure as hell thought so.

- que:
  - Who else could have used that key?
  ans:
  - We should sleep in shifts.

- que:
  - MacReady...?
  ans:
  - He's one of them.

- que:
  - The journey is part of my work.
  ans:
  - When do you think it got to him?

- que:
  - Now how did you get hurt?
  ans:
  - I had an accident.

- que:
  - On the towers?
  ans:
  - I'm training to be a high climber.

- que:
  - And everyone looks like us?
  ans:
  - Exactly like you. Well, maybe not as healthy.

- que:
  - Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
  ans:
  - We're not supposed to think about it. But I dream about it sometimes...

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - The Hall of Books.

- que:
  - What kind of stories?
  ans:
  - About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that. I don't think he even got this far.

- que:
  - This is it?
  ans:
  - Around here.

- que:
  - How did you know?!
  ans:
  - 1899.

- que:
  - What are you?
  ans:
  - I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.

- que:
  - Sir... have you a name?
  ans:
  - But you escaped.

- que:
  - How have you survived so long?
  ans:
  - Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand. It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.

- que:
  - Can you show us where they live?
  ans:
  - We need your help.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - You'll live like this forever. Alone. You were meant to help. To be with people. Not like this.

- que:
  - So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you? See all the mysteries exposed?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
  ans:
  - I'm used to that.

- que:
  - When was his mother taken?
  ans:
  - Last night.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Send him home. You don't want him to see it.

- que:
  - So, do we go on?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
  ans:
  - Oh, shut up.

- que:
  - Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
  ans:
  - Yes. But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.

- que:
  - In for a penny, in for a pound. Do you know that saying?
  ans:
  - Yes... Thank you.

- que:
  - Machines?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Vox?
  ans:
  - This way.

- que:
  - What's it all for?
  ans:
  - The air... the power.

- que:
  - Why did they built it?
  ans:
  - The Morlocks didn't build this.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Trust me... You don't want to see any more.

- que:
  - How are your dreams now?
  ans:
  - This has to end.

- que:
  - End...?
  ans:
  - This has to end.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Alexander.

- que:
  - Created?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.

- que:
  - How do you control the Morlocks?
  ans:
  - We make them see what we wish.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.

- que:
  - And what of the Eloi?
  ans:
  - They survived above. Became what they are.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go back to where you came from. Or die here.

- que:
  - Why would you let me go back?
  ans:
  - Because the past is immutable. Frozen. Dead... And you are the past.

- que:
  - Say I just come back again?
  ans:
  - Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw. Why would you come back to this? To save a few cattle? No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue.

- que:
  - Now will you go?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
  ans:
  - I'm tired of running.

- que:
  - And why not?
  ans:
  - Because...

- que:
  - God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell! How did you know to do that?
  ans:
  - I just love mechanical things.

- que:
  - You promised me flowers.
  ans:
  - May I help you?

- que:
  - You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
  ans:
  - Sorry... I was distracted.

- que:
  - Not here... alone. May we? Please?
  ans:
  - What? Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.

- que:
  - All right, what is it now?
  ans:
  - Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.

- que:
  - And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
  ans:
  - You know, the moment is rather dying here.

- que:
  - Alex, what is it?
  ans:
  - Holding you... again.

- que:
  - Alex, what is it?
  ans:
  - Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.

- que:
  - ... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
  ans:
  - So it's astronomy now, is it?

- que:
  - Do you know you were humming?
  ans:
  - I was not.

- que:
  - You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
  ans:
  - Tonight's the night?

- que:
  - Where's the challenge in that?
  ans:
  - Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor. You might want to play things a little more conservatively.

- que:
  - Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat. Do you want your students to turn out like them?
  ans:
  - I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.

- que:
  - But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
  ans:
  - In the future, we'll be better.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
  ans:
  - Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - She's gotten into your equations.

- que:
  - I came by the house every day after the funeral. And then every week. Then every other month. Then I stopped coming. Did you even notice?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, David.

- que:
  - Then why are you here?
  ans:
  - For God's Sake, David --

- que:
  - That's where you're wrong. I will change it.
  ans:
  - Do you find her?

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't believe me.

- que:
  - When's the last time you were outside this house -- -- or this room?
  ans:
  - I can't leave when I'm so close.

- que:
  - All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
  ans:
  - In a week... we will never have had this conversation.

- que:
  - Sir...?
  ans:
  - And your jewelry too. I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.

- que:
  - Yes...
  ans:
  - Did you hear me, lad?

- que:
  - How long did you travel?
  ans:
  - Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really. It's rather hard to explain.

- que:
  - Is there a lot of illness?
  ans:
  - Some. But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.

- que:
  - Your husband is dead?
  ans:
  - He's gone to a better place.

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - You might find the truth rather hard to understand.

- que:
  - How long ago?
  ans:
  - More than 800,000 years.

- que:
  - I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
  ans:
  - Just a dream. You should sleep too. You're still not well.

- que:
  - Don't then have stars where you come from?
  ans:
  - Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights. I never really noticed them much...

- que:
  - All of you?
  ans:
  - Every night.

- que:
  - And this is your \"work\"?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Want to be a high climber now, do you?
  ans:
  - It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.

- que:
  - What's it all for?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - It has no purpose. It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
  ans:
  - Most things. We're very high on purpose.

- que:
  - What are you?
  ans:
  - I'm a planner. I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.

- que:
  - How do you decide?
  ans:
  - I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done. I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.

- que:
  - Learning was important?
  ans:
  - Oh very. Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time. Night and day.

- que:
  - Did you have fires at night?
  ans:
  - It must have been safe.

- que:
  - Alexander...?
  ans:
  - Orion's belt...

- que:
  - You know this?
  ans:
  - Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path. We're on the carriage path.

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - If you only knew...

- que:
  - It's undamaged?
  ans:
  - Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.

- que:
  - So you can use it now?
  ans:
  - Yes... I suppose so.

- que:
  - Go back to your own time?
  ans:
  - I could...

- que:
  - Kalen...
  ans:
  - Alexander, take my son away. Take him back to your time. Will you do that?

- que:
  - Hello, Mr. Philby.
  ans:
  - Mara...?

- que:
  - What's the matter with -- ? -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
  ans:
  - Now that's more like it. You look a proper gentlemen for once.

- que:
  - Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm already swooning.

- que:
  - I see.
  ans:
  - Here?

- que:
  - As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is \"Applied Mathematics and Engineering\", am I correct?
  ans:
  - Exactly correct, sir.

- que:
  - Might I ask why?
  ans:
  - Because the assigned curriculum is boring.

- que:
  - Do they?
  ans:
  - My equations are not parlor-tricks!

- que:
  - What are your people called?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.

- que:
  - We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren. Do you know him?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.

- que:
  - Yes. I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to? An elder or patriarch of some kind?
  ans:
  - I am the oldest.

- que:
  - No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
  ans:
  - My father has gone to a better place.

- que:
  - Good morning, Alexander. Feeling up to some work?
  ans:
  - I suppose so.

- que:
  - You won't even try?
  ans:
  - We can't change the day and the night, Alexander. This is the world.

- que:
  - How did you get hurt?
  ans:
  - Kalen...

- que:
  - What's it like where you come from?
  ans:
  - We'll see about that.

- que:
  - I want to see your home. Will you take me?
  ans:
  - Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.

- que:
  - Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
  ans:
  - You'll tell me more tomorrow?

- que:
  - I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
  ans:
  - For our sake, I hope not.

- que:
  - And you've no idea where he went?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I'm glad he's gone. Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.

- que:
  - You ok?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - What about Starks?
  ans:
  - Should we be...

- que:
  - But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
  ans:
  - Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much.  Just open the drawer.

- que:
  - Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
  ans:
  - Well, your condition's pretty serious.

- que:
  - I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
  ans:
  - Depends on what you're seeing.

- que:
  -  You don't believe me, do you?
  ans:
  - I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.

- que:
  - In where?
  ans:
  -  In that thing...the Jacket.

- que:
  - They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
  ans:
  - Temporarily.

- que:
  - My business?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You killed him?
  ans:
  - I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.

- que:
  - You sure you know where to find one?
  ans:
  - I've managed to every Sunday of my life.  Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.

- que:
  - And what does that mean?
  ans:
  - Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.

- que:
  - Becker, how do you sleep at night?
  ans:
  - You in here.  Works like a drug.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I think you know. Your eyes say you do.

- que:
  -  You're his son?
  ans:
  - No. I'm not his son. I'm him.  What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.

- que:
  - How...how are you here?
  ans:
  - You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.

- que:
  - I know.  You killed me, didn't you?
  ans:
  - No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...

- que:
  - Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
  ans:
  - It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...

- que:
  - So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
  ans:
  - The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.

- que:
  - How did you come to know their names?
  ans:
  - You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.

- que:
  - Do I know you from somewhere?
  ans:
  - You may have known my father, William Starks.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
  ans:
  - My father used to talk about you.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, what'd he say?
  ans:
  - Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...

- que:
  - I didn't.  Did you have anything to do with his death?
  ans:
  - He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.

- que:
  - What should they be looking for?
  ans:
  - They should just be looking harder.

- que:
  - Where?  It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.

- que:
  - You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
  ans:
  - I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.

- que:
  - You done with your small talk?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  -  What do you need me to do?
  ans:
  -  Thank you.

- que:
  - His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
  ans:
  - No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.

- que:
  - What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just do it.

- que:
  - You two ok?
  ans:
  - Our car won't start.

- que:
  - Your mom take anything before this happened?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but I don't know what.

- que:
  -  What's your name?
  ans:
  - Jackie.

- que:
  - Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're just gonna walk?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something.  Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.

- que:
  - What're those?
  ans:
  - Dog tags.  They've got your name and date of birth for identification.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  -  In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.

- que:
  - What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
  ans:
  - No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.

- que:
  -  What?
  ans:
  - William Starks is dead...  I've been to his grave.

- que:
  -  What?
  ans:
  - His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I gave you my dog tags.

- que:
  - How'd he die?
  ans:
  - It's December 25th, 1993 today.

- que:
  - The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.

- que:
  - Do you really believe me?
  ans:
  - I don't know.  And when you left, all I wanted was...

- que:
  -  I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - If they don't take me out before then.  What's the net?
  ans:
  - I didn't kill Officer Harrison.

- que:
  - How? Did they figure it out after I died?
  ans:
  - I don't believe a thing she just said.

- que:
  - Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - You think Lorenson kills you?
  ans:
  - Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.

- que:
  - How long do we have?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.

- que:
  - What? What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - There're no cars on this street.

- que:
  - I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.

- que:
  - Then why isn't there anyone around?
  ans:
  -  I don't know.

- que:
  - Of course he will.  What day of the week is it?
  ans:
  - It's Sunday.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - To the hospital.

- que:
  - What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
  ans:
  - Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.

- que:
  - 112 Orchard Way.  You're not coming back, are you?
  ans:
  - You gotta stop thinking like that.

- que:
  - Then, where are you going?
  ans:
  - Nowhere.  I just think I'm gonna be sick.

- que:
  - Good. How's your mom?
  ans:
  - Ok, I guess.

- que:
  - It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
  ans:
  - I fell down.  But I'm alive.

- que:
  - How you doin'?
  ans:
  - I'm doing fine.

- que:
  - Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
  ans:
  - It's complicated, but  in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.

- que:
  - And if I didn't want to come?
  ans:
  - I guess I'd ask you why.

- que:
  - Why, what would you do?
  ans:
  - I could try to...make it stop.

- que:
  - So it's helping?
  ans:
  - You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.

- que:
  - I never knew my father. Did you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I did.  He was my most memorable patient.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.

- que:
  - What case?
  ans:
  - I was working with a boy named Eugene.

- que:
  - How'd he get it?
  ans:
  -  I don't know.

- que:
  - How do you know about Dr. Becker?
  ans:
  - My dad wrote some things down before he died.

- que:
  - It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
  ans:
  -  Yeah, it is.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You have no idea what's going on.

- que:
  - I don't know.  Remember?
  ans:
  - Come on. Tell me what you do know.

- que:
  - Well, what time is it?
  ans:
  - 2004.

- que:
  - Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
  ans:
  - It doesn't look all that different.

- que:
  - The future doesn't look different?
  ans:
  - No. Not for people like me.  Not in the places I come from.

- que:
  - What about the world?
  ans:
  - I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.

- que:
  -  Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Why don't you help me?
  ans:
  - Because I don't have time.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.

- que:
  - And how do you know that?
  ans:
  - Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.

- que:
  - How do you know about Eugene?
  ans:
  - You told me this was how it happened.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Who...who kills me?
  ans:
  - You have nothing to fear, William.

- que:
  - Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
  ans:
  - Can I get some paper and something to write with.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I'm not gonna let that happen.

- que:
  - You still don't believe me, do you?
  ans:
  - I do believe you...

- que:
  - Who told you this?
  ans:
  - I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.

- que:
  - You know how to get there?
  ans:
  - Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.

- que:
  - Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
  ans:
  - TV. Helps numb  Rudy MacKenzie.

- que:
  - Don't you go to jail for that?
  ans:
  - I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.

- que:
  - What were you talking about the other day?
  ans:
  - I wasn't talking about anything.

- que:
  -  How do you know?
  ans:
  - The Jacket.

- que:
  - MacKenzie,  what if we are crazy?
  ans:
  -  Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.

- que:
  - You ever been to jail?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.

- que:
  - Can you drive?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - All right.  You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - You don't have anywhere to stay?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Well, where are you from?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.  I don't really know.

- que:
  - Why \"of course\"?
  ans:
  - Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.

- que:
  - Well, how'd you get here?
  ans:
  -  I was dropped off.

- que:
  - Do you have a motel or something? Money?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
  ans:
  - No.  Not around here.

- que:
  - Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.  Thanks for bringing me this far.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - The best I could do with what was in your fridge.

- que:
  - You want a drink?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  -  I do it.

- que:
  -  Why'd you stop?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but I think part of it's...

- que:
  -  Why?
  ans:
  -  Real is overrated.

- que:
  - You don't think that's crazy?
  ans:
  - Maybe.  Maybe not.

- que:
  - So you never knew your mother?
  ans:
  - I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette.  I came home from work and she was gone.

- que:
  - That when you stopped being a nurse?
  ans:
  - Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that! Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.

- que:
  - You want anything special for dinner?
  ans:
  - No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner. I may not even make it home for dinner. You know how Fridays are.

- que:
  - No you won't. You'll be back today. Now! You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit. Thelma, do you understand me?
  ans:
  - Darryl.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go fuck yourself.

- que:
  - Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
  ans:
  - I could shoot your cousin Eddie.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.

- que:
  - I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
  ans:
  - I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.

- que:
  - On what?
  ans:
  - Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids. I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.

- que:
  - Who's the nut?
  ans:
  - That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.

- que:
  - Alright! She did good! Didn't she?
  ans:
  - Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.

- que:
  - Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
  ans:
  - Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.

- que:
  - Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
  ans:
  - Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.

- que:
  - Who do you think did it?
  ans:
  - Has anybody asked his wife? She's the one I hope did it.

- que:
  - You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
  ans:
  - It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal. I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.

- que:
  - Good. You wanna tell me what happened?
  ans:
  - Sure. Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.

- que:
  - How are things goin' out there?
  ans:
  - Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.

- que:
  - You're still with us though. You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
  ans:
  - Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.

- que:
  - Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
  ans:
  - Louise, I'll do anything. I know what's makin' you run. I know what happened to you in Texas.

- que:
  - Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
  ans:
  - That's certainly possible.

- que:
  - Is this the guy you saw them with?
  ans:
  - It's him.

- que:
  - What kind of gun was it?
  ans:
  - A .38.

- que:
  - Right. Where are they?
  ans:
  - We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in. Someone will be here until we find them.

- que:
  - Oh shit.
  ans:
  - Get a hold of yourself! You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on! Calm down! Don't make me sorry I let you come!

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Stop.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I'm spinning.

- que:
  - So J.D., what are you studying in school?
  ans:
  - Human nature. I'm majoring in behavioral science.

- que:
  - So how come you don't have any kids?
  ans:
  - Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready. He's still too much of a kid himself. He prides himself on being infantile.

- que:
  - Did you get married real young?
  ans:
  - Twenty-four isn't young. I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married. I've never been with anybody but Darryl.

- que:
  - Louise, is that you?
  ans:
  - Thelma? It's me.

- que:
  - I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Nothin'. Took a shower.

- que:
  - Oh. I... where's Louise?
  ans:
  - She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.

- que:
  - What?! Parole officer? You mean you're a criminal?
  ans:
  - Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.

- que:
  - What did ya do?
  ans:
  - I'm a robber.

- que:
  - You're a bank robber?
  ans:
  - Nope. I've never robbed a bank.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...

- que:
  - No, I mean how would you do it? Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
  ans:
  - Tell me.

- que:
  - Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world are you doin' here?
  ans:
  - Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.

- que:
  - Who's your friend?
  ans:
  - Well, come on, gal, I got you a room. You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.

- que:
  - Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
  ans:
  - What the fuck is going on?

- que:
  - Can't it go to any office?
  ans:
  - Tell me now.

- que:
  - I know. Call me back. Louise, I love you, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Is that how you answer the phone?
  ans:
  - I got it. I was afraid I'd missed you. I almost couldn't get a check cashed. It's Saturday.

- que:
  - Who did it?
  ans:
  - Friend of mine, owns a club. Dickie Randall. You'd know him if you saw him. His brother was in your class. Terry.

- que:
  - Good. That was good. Where do I go?
  ans:
  - It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel. The address is 1921 North East 23. It's under your name.

- que:
  - And what's the mysterious code word?
  ans:
  - Peaches.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's the code word. I miss you, peaches.

- que:
  - Oh my God! Jimmy! You... Oh my God! What are you doin' here?
  ans:
  - Can we get another room? Just put it on my credit card.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's me.

- que:
  - Okay, peaches, okay. But can I ask you one thing?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Does it have something to do with another guy? Are you in love with him?
  ans:
  - It's nothin' like that.

- que:
  - Can I just ask you one other thing?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Why now, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Cause, Louise. I don't want to lose you. And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.

- que:
  - Are you just doin' this to punish me?
  ans:
  - Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.

- que:
  - Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
  ans:
  - I'm choking on it.

- que:
  - You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Is this your car?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - In the back?
  ans:
  - Front.

- que:
  - Am I in trouble?
  ans:
  - As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.

- que:
  - He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl. Are you at work?
  ans:
  - No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.

- que:
  - What time are you gonna pick me up?
  ans:
  - You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be there around two or three.

- que:
  - What kind of stuff do I bring?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains. I guess it gets cold at night. I'm just gonna bring everything.

- que:
  - In case of what?
  ans:
  - In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.

- que:
  - Whose place is this again?
  ans:
  - I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.

- que:
  - How come he let you go?
  ans:
  - Cause I didn't ask him.

- que:
  - Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
  ans:
  - Isn't this fun?

- que:
  - Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
  ans:
  - So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.

- que:
  - So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
  ans:
  - Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.

- que:
  - Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
  ans:
  - West. Left.

- que:
  - Louise. Where are we going?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Thelma! I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.

- que:
  - Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.

- que:
  - Which part?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way. Do you understand that?
  ans:
  - Our next move? I'll say one thing, Louise. This is some vacation. I sure am having a good time. This is real fun.

- que:
  - Just what is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - It means shut up, Thelma.

- que:
  - Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
  ans:
  - Just what the hell is wrong with you?

- que:
  - Did you finish thinking?
  ans:
  - I think better when I drive.

- que:
  - Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
  ans:
  - Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...

- que:
  - You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell him?
  ans:
  - I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.

- que:
  - Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
  ans:
  - I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.

- que:
  - Call him?
  ans:
  - Call him. Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.

- que:
  - Will I be?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I won't be.

- que:
  - I don't want to go that way. Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
  ans:
  - What did Darryl say?

- que:
  - Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
  ans:
  - He's got a lot to be proud of.

- que:
  - So what are you gonna tell him?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'm not gonna tell him a thing. The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.

- que:
  - Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
  ans:
  - I won't wait up.

- que:
  - How do I look?
  ans:
  - You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.

- que:
  - What happened to your hair?
  ans:
  - Nothing. It got messed up.

- que:
  - Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
  ans:
  - Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I am happy. I'm very happy for you. I'm glad you had a good time. It's about time. Where is he now?
  ans:
  - Taking a shower.

- que:
  - You left that guy alone in the room?
  ans:
  - Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.

- que:
  - Don't worry about it. You want anything?
  ans:
  - Well, I just...

- que:
  - Oooooweee!! You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
  ans:
  - Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?

- que:
  - So what's the plan, Thelma? You just gonna stay drunk?
  ans:
  - Try to.

- que:
  - Ugh!! Why do they have to do that?
  ans:
  - They think we like it. Maybe they think it turns us on.

- que:
  - What.
  ans:
  - Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?

- que:
  - How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
  ans:
  - I... I...

- que:
  - Louise? Where are we?
  ans:
  - Just past Boise City.

- que:
  - Idaho?
  ans:
  - Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.

- que:
  - Whaddo we do?
  ans:
  - I'm not suggestin' that! I'm not goin' back. No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.

- que:
  - Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You mean now or before?
  ans:
  - Before.

- que:
  - Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones? Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. You mean Peek-a-poos.

- que:
  - Yeah. Those. That always put the fear of God in me. What about you?
  ans:
  - Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.

- que:
  - Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
  ans:
  - This is so beautiful.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing. It's not funny.

- que:
  - About how fast was I going?
  ans:
  - I am really sorry about this.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Hit it.

- que:
  - Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yeah, you want it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - You know why. You already said.

- que:
  - I said all that?
  ans:
  - No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you? I mean, I just wanna know.

- que:
  - Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You awake?
  ans:
  - You could call it that. My eyes are open.

- que:
  - Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
  ans:
  - It'd have to be pretty good.

- que:
  - Hey. Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
  ans:
  - Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We've gone insane.

- que:
  - How far are we from Mexico?
  ans:
  - About two hundred and fifty miles.

- que:
  - We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
  ans:
  - How long do you think that'll take?

- que:
  - You too, sweetie, the best.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
  ans:
  - No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - We're not giving up, Thelma.

- que:
  - What are you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - Go.

- que:
  - Go?
  ans:
  - You're a good friend.

- que:
  - What? What are you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.

- que:
  - Are you going to apologize or not?
  ans:
  - Yeah... sure did.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - BROTHER You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.

- que:
  - Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
  ans:
  - Jeez, I didn't catch it.

- que:
  - No harm, no foul?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - You sent that?
  ans:
  - He implied it.

- que:
  - Let me ask you this, When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
  ans:
  - Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

- que:
  - What's he like?
  ans:
  - You're leaving it out. Finish your swing. You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.

- que:
  - Good-looking?
  ans:
  - What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.

- que:
  - Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
  ans:
  - I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.

- que:
  - Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - Never?
  ans:
  - Well once. Mary.

- que:
  - Whatever happened to Mary?
  ans:
  - I told you, her family moved to Miami.

- que:
  - Well why don't you look her up?
  ans:
  - Yeah, right.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.

- que:
  - What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
  ans:
  - I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed.

- que:
  - So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
  ans:
  - I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

- que:
  - You're kidding? What did they say?
  ans:
  - They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.

- que:
  - And you think he could find out her number for me?
  ans:
  - Well... at least now you know.

- que:
  - Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
  ans:
  - What's so funny?

- que:
  - What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
  ans:
  - Well think about it.

- que:
  - No You mean...?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - Yeah feels like it.

- que:
  - How the hell did you get here anyway?
  ans:
  - Flew. Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.

- que:
  - No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
  ans:
  - And this adversely affects me how...?

- que:
  - Well? What are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - I don't know what to say.

- que:
  - Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
  ans:
  - Got cash.

- que:
  - Car clean? Plenty of gas?
  ans:
  - Check.

- que:
  - Mints?
  ans:
  - Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.

- que:
  - Hm?
  ans:
  - You know, clean the pipes.

- que:
  - Pipes? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

- que:
  - Think about it, After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - I'm usually too tired to be.

- que:
  - Dom? What are you?
  ans:
  - You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. Where was he?
  ans:
  - Out getting coffee.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Mary.

- que:
  - A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
  ans:
  - I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.

- que:
  - Oh come on, why would I lie?
  ans:
  - Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.

- que:
  - Thanks.
  ans:
  - That right?

- que:
  - You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
  ans:
  - Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.

- que:
  - Stalker, huh?
  ans:
  - Big time.

- que:
  - Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
  ans:
  - Take it easy, that's Bill.

- que:
  - This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
  ans:
  - No I can't.

- que:
  - Am I?
  ans:
  - Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.

- que:
  - Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
  ans:
  - Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.

- que:
  - The sawbones?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
  ans:
  - But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.

- que:
  - I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Nepal? Have you been?
  ans:
  - Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.

- que:
  - You own a home there?
  ans:
  - Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.

- que:
  - Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
  ans:
  - Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.

- que:
  - By the way, what's your name?
  ans:
  - Pat Healy.

- que:
  - Don't you want to know my name?
  ans:
  - I already know it, Mary.

- que:
  - How'd you know that?
  ans:
  - It's right there on your golf bag.

- que:
  - What are you doing with all these blueprints?
  ans:
  - Some buildings I'm working on.

- que:
  - Are you... an architect?
  ans:
  - Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I work with retards.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus.

- que:
  - Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
  ans:
  - The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.

- que:
  - Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
  ans:
  - Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.

- que:
  - Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
  ans:
  - We will, but first I have a surprise.

- que:
  - A surprise?
  ans:
  - The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

- que:
  - Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
  ans:
  - Deco.

- que:
  - Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
  ans:
  - That...? Vestibule.

- que:
  - How about -- ?
  ans:
  - When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.

- que:
  - And it doesn't cramp your style?
  ans:
  - Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.

- que:
  - Lint?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...

- que:
  - Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
  ans:
  - Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...

- que:
  - You're a movie buff?
  ans:
  - Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.

- que:
  - Have you seen it?
  ans:
  - No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.

- que:
  - Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No, forget it, it was stupid.

- que:
  - Come on, what were you going to say?
  ans:
  - Nah, really, it was moronic.

- que:
  - You look great. Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Who the hell's Woogie?
  ans:
  - Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.

- que:
  - All you want is a phone number?
  ans:
  - Well, I know you're busy...

- que:
  - Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me, Did you knock this skirt up?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - She's blackmailing you, right?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You want her dead, don't you?
  ans:
  - You can't be serious.

- que:
  - Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
  ans:
  - I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.

- que:
  - Really? Very, very?
  ans:
  - I think your life's about to change.

- que:
  - So you found Mary?
  ans:
  - Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.

- que:
  - That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something, Was she a little big-boned in high school?
  ans:
  - No, not at all.

- que:
  - Mary's a little chubby, huh?
  ans:
  - I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.

- que:
  - So she's married?
  ans:
  - Nope. Never been.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Four kids, three different guys.

- que:
  - Three different guys?
  ans:
  - It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...

- que:
  - Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
  ans:
  - Oh, uh, I resigned.

- que:
  - Miami?
  ans:
  - Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.

- que:
  - Jai alai?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.

- que:
  - But you said she was a sparkplug...?
  ans:
  - I said buttplug. She's heinous.

- que:
  - Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
  ans:
  - You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.

- que:
  - Mary's a mail-order bride?
  ans:
  - Answer the question, shitball.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - Turn her over to a stalker.

- que:
  - Oh Christ... poor dog.
  ans:
  - What?! You're calling me a stalker?

- que:
  - You're a sick man, you know that?
  ans:
  - Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.

- que:
  - Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
  ans:
  - Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.

- que:
  - Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
  ans:
  - Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.

- que:
  - Harvard?
  ans:
  - You bet.

- que:
  - Did you study under Kim Greene?
  ans:
  - Among others.

- que:
  - Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
  ans:
  - No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
  ans:
  - Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.

- que:
  - Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
  ans:
  - Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.

- que:
  - Bullshit!
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - How'd you manage that one?
  ans:
  - Friend. Baseball bat.

- que:
  - How many is that?
  ans:
  - Four.

- que:
  - That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
  ans:
  - I never said that.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.

- que:
  - Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
  ans:
  - Oh... Sully.

- que:
  - Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
  ans:
  - Thanks for picking me up.

- que:
  - Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
  ans:
  - Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.

- que:
  - Hm?
  ans:
  - That right? Good for you.

- que:
  - Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
  ans:
  - The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.

- que:
  - Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
  ans:
  - How do you guarantee that?

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - It means you're too hard on guys.

- que:
  - Have you been up all night again?
  ans:
  - Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.

- que:
  - Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
  ans:
  - These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.

- que:
  - So who's the lucky guy?
  ans:
  - Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.

- que:
  - Good lookin'?
  ans:
  - He's no Steve Young.

- que:
  - What's he like?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He's kind of a mook.

- que:
  - What's a mook?
  ans:
  - You know, a mookalone, a schlep.

- que:
  - Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
  ans:
  - Come on, Magda It's like that movie Harold and Maude.

- que:
  - Sure. Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

- que:
  - Bundt cake?
  ans:
  - Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.

- que:
  - Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
  ans:
  - Healy.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.

- que:
  - An old flame?
  ans:
  - Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.

- que:
  - You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
  ans:
  - I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday. I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

- que:
  - Where's Puffy?
  ans:
  - Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.

- que:
  - Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
  ans:
  - Pat does projects all over the world.

- que:
  - You don't think they're too big?
  ans:
  - No no, the bigger the better. But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.

- que:
  - That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
  ans:
  - I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.

- que:
  - Can I pour you one?
  ans:
  - Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

- que:
  - You mean he's not a criminal?
  ans:
  - Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.

- que:
  - Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
  ans:
  - No, it's an old football injury.

- que:
  - Oh, are you on the team?
  ans:
  - No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.

- que:
  - The prom -- you going?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Ted, are you okay?
  ans:
  - Just a minute.

- que:
  - Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
  ans:
  - Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?

- que:
  - And did everything -- ?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

- que:
  - By the way, how's he doing?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - Oh. So... what brings you down here?
  ans:
  - Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.

- que:
  - Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
  ans:
  - Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.

- que:
  - I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years. Don't make me wait another day.

- que:
  - Hm?
  ans:
  - On your ear, you've got something.

- que:
  - Now by killer, you mean...?
  ans:
  - I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.

- que:
  - What are you?
  ans:
  - Twenty-two.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - We've got a lot in common.

- que:
  - So you're a writer?
  ans:
  - Trying to be.

- que:
  - What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
  ans:
  - ...and then it was all over. We haven't spoken since.

- que:
  - Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
  ans:
  - Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.

- que:
  - What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
  ans:
  - Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

- que:
  - Then what the fuck did you do it for?
  ans:
  - I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.

- que:
  - Ted...?
  ans:
  - I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.

- que:
  - But but what about Steve?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - Yeah? What do you want?
  ans:
  - Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

- que:
  - What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
  ans:
  - I wish.

- que:
  - You got what stuck?
  ans:
  - It.

- que:
  - Is it the frank or the beans?
  ans:
  - I think a little of both.

- que:
  - How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.

- que:
  - Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
  ans:
  - Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?

- que:
  - Is that bubble what I think it is?
  ans:
  - Well, there's only one thing to do.

- que:
  - So what's up?
  ans:
  - Eh.

- que:
  - Okay. So is that a yes or a no?
  ans:
  - I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.

- que:
  - We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
  ans:
  - Giddy-up.

- que:
  - Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna take a rain check.

- que:
  - Huh...?
  ans:
  - See you, Warren.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.

- que:
  - This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
  ans:
  - He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.

- que:
  - What if I can't?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm not.

- que:
  - Then you'll call, right?
  ans:
  - Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.

- que:
  - That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
  ans:
  - We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.

- que:
  - He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
  ans:
  - How does a guy get a rep like that?

- que:
  - What happened to speak when spoken to?
  ans:
  - Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.

- que:
  - What's gotten into you?
  ans:
  - Oh, still sore about this.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.

- que:
  - We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
  ans:
  - Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.

- que:
  - Slow down. Smell that?
  ans:
  - Smoke.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Kenny. It's over.

- que:
  - What's it about?
  ans:
  - Cuba.

- que:
  - What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
  ans:
  - I think it's a bad idea.

- que:
  - This is from the Highest Authority?
  ans:
  - Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.

- que:
  - And the second condition?
  ans:
  - Time is of the essence.

- que:
  - John. How much time?
  ans:
  - 48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.

- que:
  - Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.

- que:
  - How long until the army is ready?
  ans:
  - We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.

- que:
  - Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
  ans:
  - Still heading for Cuba.

- que:
  - So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
  ans:
  - Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.

- que:
  - Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
  ans:
  - Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.

- que:
  - What's happened?
  ans:
  - What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.

- que:
  - A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
  ans:
  - I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.

- que:
  - How's my favorite President?
  ans:
  - Busy. But you've got his heart.

- que:
  - It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
  ans:
  - Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.

- que:
  - Hey, sport. You winning?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What about you? Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Back to work.

- que:
  - So what've we got today?
  ans:
  - Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...

- que:
  - Still think Cuba isn't important?
  ans:
  - Not as far as the election goes.

- que:
  - Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
  ans:
  - You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.

- que:
  - What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
  ans:
  - We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.

- que:
  - How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
  ans:
  - That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.

- que:
  - Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
  ans:
  - Hello?

- que:
  - Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
  ans:
  - Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
  ans:
  - I thought we were staying on the reservation.

- que:
  - FBI? What you investigatin'?
  ans:
  - A murder. On the reservation.

- que:
  - James Looks Twice?
  ans:
  - That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.

- que:
  - What's this about?
  ans:
  - Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.

- que:
  - Sioux Indian, right?
  ans:
  - Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.

- que:
  - Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
  ans:
  - Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.

- que:
  - Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
  ans:
  - It ain't Geronimo.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.

- que:
  - We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
  ans:
  - No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh... Ray... Little Weasel.

- que:
  - What journey?
  ans:
  - Tell him, Ray.

- que:
  - South Dakota... Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
  ans:
  - No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.

- que:
  - No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
  ans:
  - Six rounds. 357.

- que:
  - Who the fuck is he?
  ans:
  - -- a fucking cop.

- que:
  - Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
  ans:
  - Beats the hell outta me.

- que:
  - How'd you know?
  ans:
  - I got one up on ya.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.

- que:
  - What'd she say?
  ans:
  - She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.

- que:
  - Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
  ans:
  - Her oil pan is shot.

- que:
  - Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
  ans:
  - Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.

- que:
  - Cooch. Where the fuck did they send us?
  ans:
  - A long way from home. You be careful out there.

- que:
  - She's that subtle?
  ans:
  - Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.

- que:
  - -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
  ans:
  - Jesus, you alright?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...

- que:
  - Let the press through.
  ans:
  - We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?

- que:
  - I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
  ans:
  - After we've completed our investigation.

- que:
  - You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
  ans:
  - Is that right? Well, listen to this, drag your ass. This is a restricted area.

- que:
  - Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
  ans:
  - He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.

- que:
  - He knows me?
  ans:
  - He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.

- que:
  - What's he smoke in that?
  ans:
  - Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He said he doesn't know.

- que:
  - What was he saying?
  ans:
  - Why should I tell you.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.

- que:
  - Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
  ans:
  - He also said \"listen to the water.\"

- que:
  - That's not solid.
  ans:
  - She's your sister?

- que:
  - The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
  ans:
  - Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - Red Deer Table, Ray.

- que:
  - -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
  ans:
  - Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?

- que:
  - What'd you expect to hear?
  ans:
  - Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.

- que:
  - Cuz I'm a skin?
  ans:
  - Cuz you're a cop.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.

- que:
  - Still after Jimmy?
  ans:
  - They found prints at Blue Legs' place.

- que:
  - You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
  ans:
  - No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.

- que:
  - Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
  ans:
  - No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.

- que:
  - Do they come in dreams, these visions?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.

- que:
  - At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
  ans:
  - Nothin'. Forget it.

- que:
  - Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Fitful dreams.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.

- que:
  - Jesus. Oil?
  ans:
  - Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.

- que:
  - This Clear Moon's house?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.

- que:
  - They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - We're going for The Stronghold.

- que:
  - Some Indian time?
  ans:
  - I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.

- que:
  - This Jimmy's?
  ans:
  - You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.

- que:
  - Who did?
  ans:
  - A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.

- que:
  - I desecrated it?
  ans:
  - Your relatives must've taught you something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.

- que:
  - Come back?
  ans:
  - Never mind.

- que:
  - What are you doing on the reservation?
  ans:
  - I'm on my way back in. Over.

- que:
  - Do you want a coffee?
  ans:
  - No. No, no. Thank you.

- que:
  - Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
  ans:
  - Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.

- que:
  - No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
  ans:
  - Washington sent ya. I know that.

- que:
  - What the fuck you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.

- que:
  - I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
  ans:
  - The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.

- que:
  - Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
  ans:
  - Keep talking, Yellow Bird...

- que:
  - It isn't?
  ans:
  - Well, it is. It is that, too.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.

- que:
  - And on to a bigger one with you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, most likely.

- que:
  - Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
  ans:
  - I heard of one once.

- que:
  - How did you know this was my car?
  ans:
  - Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I saw one.

- que:
  - You saw a MiG 21?
  ans:
  - I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.

- que:
  - Where did you see that?
  ans:
  - It's classified.

- que:
  - It's what?
  ans:
  - It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

- que:
  - Not in this case. CHARLIE You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - On his six.

- que:
  - He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.

- que:
  - If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
  ans:
  - I was inverted.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - You know. The finger.

- que:
  - You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What would?
  ans:
  - What would you say, too fast...too quick...

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.

- que:
  - Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
  ans:
  - Um. You.

- que:
  - Too aggressive?
  ans:
  - I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.

- que:
  - What if he's not?
  ans:
  - You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.

- que:
  - How about what?
  ans:
  - How about anything, anything you want to do.

- que:
  - What about the plane?
  ans:
  - What plane.

- que:
  - Used to what?
  ans:
  - I'm different.

- que:
  - Make what?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - Why'd you do that?
  ans:
  - It dies. We live.

- que:
  - That's true. What are you?
  ans:
  - I don't enjoy watching things suffer.

- que:
  - You ever think about killing another human being?
  ans:
  - About as much as they think about killing me.

- que:
  - Does it bother you?
  ans:
  - You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.

- que:
  - Are you really that brave?
  ans:
  - It's just as I thought.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're totally insane.

- que:
  - You want to go ballistic?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't like being out of control.

- que:
  - And now?
  ans:
  - And now I want you.

- que:
  - You always get what you want?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well no...inverse order.

- que:
  - You ever fly an F-14?
  ans:
  - I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.

- que:
  - Why, what's gonna happen?
  ans:
  - Lucky charm.

- que:
  - Pawn shop. What's to eat?
  ans:
  - ...they say you're alright.

- que:
  - The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
  ans:
  - He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.

- que:
  - Do what, show you a good time?
  ans:
  - I'm not good company. I should be alone.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want it back.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yesterday.

- que:
  - What do you do when you come here?
  ans:
  - I sit. I think. I play games.

- que:
  - What kind of games?
  ans:
  - I like to play \"reality\".

- que:
  - Strip reality! How do you play that?
  ans:
  - You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game.

- que:
  - What truth?
  ans:
  - The big one. The one that's most on your mind.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Take something off.

- que:
  - Off me or off you?
  ans:
  - That's up to you.

- que:
  - Looks like a tie.
  ans:
  - What does it mean?

- que:
  - Who's gonna win?
  ans:
  - We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...

- que:
  - You weren't gonna say goodbye?
  ans:
  - I was, later.

- que:
  - How could you?
  ans:
  - ...Something like that.

- que:
  - Yes sir. I do, Sir.
  ans:
  - Well?

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Sir. I was going Mach point one five.

- que:
  - Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
  ans:
  - F-14's sir.

- que:
  - Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
  ans:
  - No sir! But you have to be ready.

- que:
  - Yes, Sergeant?
  ans:
  - Remember one thing.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.

- que:
  - WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
  ans:

  ans:
  - EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED. ROLL IT, COUGAR.

- que:
  - YEAH, COUGAR?
  ans:
  - These guys are getting on my nerves.

- que:
  - WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
  ans:
  - DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.

- que:
  - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
  ans:
  - NO. NO GOOD.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Saving them some paperwork.

- que:
  - Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
  ans:
  - Since when did you care about paperwork?

- que:
  - Don't WORRY!!!? You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
  ans:
  - Roger, I've got it.

- que:
  - Now have you got it? Have you still got it?
  ans:
  - Yawing right.

- que:
  - Is there something I should know?
  ans:
  - Just relax.

- que:
  - Is it the plane?
  ans:
  - The plane is fine.

- que:
  - MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
  ans:
  - Is it you?

- que:
  - Why do they call you Wolf?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't know. That depends.

- que:
  - On what?
  ans:
  - Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Oh...I'll think of something.

- que:
  - Did what?
  ans:
  - Got you here.

- que:
  - Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.

- que:
  - Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
  ans:
  - The list is long, but distinguished.

- que:
  - Who's your pilot?
  ans:
  - Tom Kazansky.

- que:
  - How was it?
  ans:
  - Could use a dash more jet fuel.

- que:
  - Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.

- que:
  - Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
  ans:
  - Gotta keep track of the competition.

- que:
  - Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.

- que:
  - What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
  ans:
  - Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

- que:
  - Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Just once, if they take your plane away.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.

- que:
  - What the hell is this?
  ans:
  - Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.

- que:
  - Something bothering you?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Let's just go fight.

- que:
  - No shit! That why they call him Ice?
  ans:
  - Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.

- que:
  - What'd you do?
  ans:
  - It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.

- que:
  - The girl with the purple fingernails?
  ans:
  - That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.

- que:
  - I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
  ans:
  - Who is the best.

- que:
  - Need a hint?
  ans:
  - I think I can work it out on my own.

- que:
  - The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
  ans:
  - Just below ten thousand.

- que:
  - Who's the hell is that?
  ans:
  - Three guesses.

- que:
  - COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
  ans:
  - I...FORGOT SOMETHING.

- que:
  - What the hell you doing?
  ans:
  - It was bad.

- que:
  - Bad?
  ans:
  - The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.

- que:
  - No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
  ans:
  - Morning, Coogan.

- que:
  - How's it goin', Coog?
  ans:
  - He's a good pilot.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...

- que:
  - Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
  ans:
  - Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.

- que:
  - The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
  ans:
  - I wasn't thinking. I just did it.

- que:
  - Then why are you here?
  ans:
  - For the same reason you are.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
  ans:
  - Or....

- que:
  - What's wrong with this one?
  ans:
  - He ain't got five kids to feed.

- que:
  - Where's yours?
  ans:
  - Over there man.

- que:
  - What to the rebels want?
  ans:
  - Oh, the usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

- que:
  - So, where to?
  ans:
  - The Last Resort.

- que:
  - First time on Mars?
  ans:
  - Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory.

- que:
  - What happened to them?
  ans:
  - Cheap domes. And no air to screen out the rays.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...

- que:
  - Lemme ask you a question. Ever fuck a mutant?
  ans:
  - Take me to the hotel.

- que:
  - Hey, I got four kids to feed.
  ans:
  - What happened to number five?

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal.

- que:
  - How'd you find me?
  ans:
  - I'd advise you to hurry.

- que:
  - Would you like the same suite?
  ans:
  - Definitely.

- que:
  - Identification?
  ans:
  - I'll go encode your room key.

- que:
  - May I use your pen?
  ans:
  - Well, my boy, you're a hero.

- que:
  - So why am I still alive?
  ans:
  - We gave you lots of help. Benny here...

- que:
  - Who is it this time--my mother?
  ans:
  - The guy's a fucking asshole.

- que:
  - Do you expect me to believe you?
  ans:
  - Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...

- que:
  - Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - You better get down here.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - We haven't implanted it yet.

- que:
  - Two-headed monsters?
  ans:
  - Don't you keep up with the news? We're doing alien artifacts now.

- que:
  - So, been married long?
  ans:
  - Eight years.

- que:
  - Your sexual orientation?
  ans:
  - Hetero.

- que:
  - Blonde, brunette, redhead?

  - Brunette.

- que:
  - Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
  ans:
  - Demure, aggressive, sleazy? Be honest.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.

- que:
  - Amazing. Where are we?
  ans:
  - At Rekall.

- que:
  - How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
  ans:
  - Bullshit. It's all coincidence.

- que:
  - What about the girl? Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified. Is that a coincidence?
  ans:
  - She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.

- que:
  - Suppose I do...then what?
  ans:
  - Swallow this.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's a symbol. Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

- que:
  - Any news of Quaid?
  ans:
  - Not since you lost him.

- que:
  - We don't have much choice then, do we?
  ans:
  - Sit down.

- que:
  - Where's Kuato?
  ans:
  - On his way.

- que:
  - You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What, aliens?
  ans:
  - You tell me.

- que:
  - You're Kuato, right?
  ans:
  - They sell fake memories.

- que:
  - \"RekallRekallRekall.\" You thinkin' of goin' there?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you did. I told you not to but you did anyway.

- que:
  - What are you, my father?
  ans:
  - Let me buy you a drink.

- que:
  - Harry, what the hell is this?
  ans:
  - Come on, let's go have that drink.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Up to the right.

- que:
  - Are you saying she liked it?
  ans:
  - I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.

- que:
  - What the hell is this?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. Would you please rephrase the question.

- que:
  - Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
  ans:
  - Welcome to JohnnyCab. Where can I...?

- que:
  - Is that better?
  ans:
  - Mmmm.....

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Nobody.

- que:
  - Nobody?! What's her name?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - ...You mean it?
  ans:
  - You know I do.

- que:
  - Yeah, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - Let's do it.

- que:
  - And you believe him?
  ans:
  - All right, forget about it.

- que:
  - Well...What do you say?
  ans:
  - I'm late.

- que:
  - Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here. Okay?
  ans:
  - Lori, don't you understand? I feel I was meant for something more than this. I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.

- que:
  - Harry from work...He was the boss.
  ans:
  - What are you doing?

- que:
  - Take it easy. Tell me exactly what happened? Why would \"spies\" want to kill you?
  ans:
  - It was implanted by the Agency.

- que:
  - And falling in love?
  ans:
  - Implanted.

- que:
  - Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
  ans:
  - The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.

- que:
  - O.K. then. If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
  ans:
  - Beats me. I just work here.

- que:
  - Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Some of it was fun.

- que:
  - That a problem?
  ans:
  - I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars.

- que:
  - How real does it seem?
  ans:
  - As real as any memory in your head.

- que:
  - What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
  ans:
  - You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket. Look at the statistics.

- que:
  - Whatever you say...Just answer one question. What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
  ans:
  - I give up.

- que:
  - Secret agent...How much is that?
  ans:
  - Go on.

- que:
  - I love you.
  ans:
  - They'll be here any minute! They'll kill you all!

- que:
  - Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
  ans:
  - Blondes.

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - There's something I have to tell you...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I don't remember you. I don't remember us. I don't even remember me.

- que:
  - What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
  ans:
  - Hauser left me a note.

- que:
  - Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
  ans:
  - She wasn't really my wife.

- que:
  - Why would I lie to you?
  ans:
  - Because you're still working for Cohaagen.

- que:
  - Inside what?
  ans:
  - I think you better leave.

- que:
  - I used to model for 'em, why?
  ans:
  - Just wondering.

- que:
  - What can I do?
  ans:
  - Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me.

- que:
  - Oh, since when?
  ans:
  - He's lying.

- que:
  - Where's this \"reactor\" come from?
  ans:
  - It's just up ahead.

- que:
  - I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
  ans:
  - Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.

- que:
  - I gave you?
  ans:
  - Ready as we'll ever be.

- que:
  - Okay, Burt, listen. Forget shooting them. Tell me this, can you get to your truck?
  ans:
  - No problem.

- que:
  - Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do?
  ans:
  - Hang on, Burt. The bastards are up to something.

- que:
  - What the hell is that, anyway?
  ans:
  - Cannon fuse.

- que:
  - What do you use it for?
  ans:
  - My cannon.

- que:
  - Burt, can you hear me now?
  ans:
  - Well, we'll ask around. Let you know if we hear of anything.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
  ans:
  - No. We go straight.

- que:
  - Could we make it to the mountains?
  ans:
  - Where the hell are they? Hope they didn't wise up.

- que:
  - You bet. You gonna be staying up here?
  ans:
  - Well, yeah! There's going to be major research up here. First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.

- que:
  - You didn't cook breakfast?
  ans:
  - Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.

- que:
  - How many cows does it take to make a stampede? Is it like three or more? Is there a minimum speed?
  ans:
  - If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.

- que:
  - Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student?
  ans:
  - Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.

- que:
  - What the hell do we know about seismographs?
  ans:
  - Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...

- que:
  - You gotta ask that?
  ans:
  - So what if we just did it...today. Pack up. Drive straight down to Bixby. Get serious.

- que:
  - I'll call that little bluff. How close?
  ans:
  - Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood.

- que:
  - If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
  ans:
  - Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...

- que:
  - You want the rifle or the Smith?
  ans:
  - The rifle.

- que:
  - Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
  ans:
  - Here's the plan...We don't even stop. Ride like hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We'll walk the horses.

- que:
  - We'll take your word for it.
  ans:
  - That is the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?

- que:
  - Yeah. Where's your truck?
  ans:
  - Prairie dog burrow...

- que:
  - Okay, now, how far's your truck?
  ans:
  - I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one...

- que:
  - Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
  ans:
  - It's been listening to us. It's got no eyes. It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...

- que:
  - Well, folks, what's the plan?
  ans:
  - First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.

- que:
  - Don't he have a home to go to?
  ans:
  - Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.

- que:
  - How the hell long it take you to change a tire?
  ans:
  - Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.

- que:
  - Wait a minute...the Cat. Could we take the Cat?
  ans:
  - Jesus. It's slower than hell.

- que:
  - Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
  ans:
  - Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...

- que:
  - Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
  ans:
  - Somebody paying you to do this?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She likes both of us. We both helped her out.

- que:
  - How's she doing?
  ans:
  - She wants to lay down. I'm a little worried.

- que:
  - We playing cards tonight?
  ans:
  - I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.

- que:
  - Hi, guys, what you been up to?
  ans:
  - Ran into the new college student, Rona.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.

- que:
  - You sure this is where it was?
  ans:
  - Twenty.

- que:
  - Around here? Why would they?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.

- que:
  - Think it's still following us?
  ans:
  - Let's assume that it is.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Yeah. One, two, three...

- que:
  - Why do you all keep asking me?
  ans:
  - Please... I need to sleep...

- que:
  - Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
  ans:
  - I'm dead. We're both dead.

- que:
  - ...Where're we goin'?
  ans:
  - That-a-boy. Hospital.

- que:
  - The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
  ans:
  - True.

- que:
  - And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
  ans:
  - Correct.

- que:
  - You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Or this -- is this a significant difference?
  ans:
  - No it is not, Mr. Dowd.

- que:
  - Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
  ans:
  - It most certainly is.

- que:
  - Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.

- que:
  - The hell you do. At this hour?
  ans:
  - Gimme back my bottle.

- que:
  - -- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
  ans:
  - You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.

- que:
  - Look, I'm a lawyer and --
  ans:
  - Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?

- que:
  - \"We\"?
  ans:
  - I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...

- que:
  - Not necessarily...
  ans:
  - No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?

- que:
  - Come now. Did you see the gun?
  ans:
  - I can describe it.

- que:
  - Oh really?
  ans:
  - It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...

- que:
  - No further questions.
  ans:
  - How can you remember that?

- que:
  - Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
  ans:
  - We had a description of the suspect.

- que:
  - A \"description\"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
  ans:
  - We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.

- que:
  - You see that? You wanna be like that?
  ans:
  - No. No...

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...

- que:
  - -- The Nazi he knifed?
  ans:
  - At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.

- que:
  - ...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
  ans:
  - With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.

- que:
  - What other case?
  ans:
  - Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.

- que:
  - You really think that's what happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.

- que:
  - -- Easy as that, huh?
  ans:
  - Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.

- que:
  - When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
  ans:
  - Eddie... I don't know about this...

- que:
  - Eddie... What's a DD-5?
  ans:
  - That DD-5.

- que:
  - Do you have to do that?
  ans:
  - \"Have to\"? No...

- que:
  - -- You found his mugshot?
  ans:
  - They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.

- que:
  - A fucking wheelchair?
  ans:
  - A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...

- que:
  - Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
  ans:
  - 1530 Rivington Street.

- que:
  - -- What?
  ans:
  - Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.

- que:
  - ...What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...

- que:
  - Let's get a cab.
  ans:
  - But what?

- que:
  - You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
  ans:
  - I followed her from the courthouse.

- que:
  - -- What?
  ans:
  - I've seen this picture before.

- que:
  - How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
  ans:
  - ... An hour. That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.

- que:
  - You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
  ans:
  - ...For ten years, now.

- que:
  - Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
  ans:
  - -- Me? Neither.

- que:
  - Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
  ans:
  - Neither.

- que:
  - You're doing a murder case?
  ans:
  - It hasn't been that long.

- que:
  - Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
  ans:
  - Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.

- que:
  - \"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators...\"?
  ans:
  - I embroidered.

- que:
  - \"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin\"?
  ans:
  - I lied.

- que:
  - A fucking wheelchair?
  ans:
  - Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...

- que:
  - Got any booze in the house?
  ans:
  - You don't drink \"booze\".

- que:
  - My mother find you?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Want to tell me what went down here?
  ans:
  - Racist asshole came at me.

- que:
  - Exactly what happened then?
  ans:
  - I killed the motherfucker.

- que:
  - But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
  ans:
  - I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.

- que:
  - But why?
  ans:
  - Maybe... because someone's afraid.

- que:
  - Afraid of what?
  ans:
  - I don't know. The truth, maybe.

- que:
  - -- About what?
  ans:
  - About Chinatown. What went down.

- que:
  - What went down?
  ans:
  - You tell me, man.

- que:
  - \"No,\" what?
  ans:
  - ...I'm dying out there.

- que:
  - I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
  ans:
  - It was self-defense.

- que:
  - -- How could I help you?
  ans:
  - By trusting me. Shit, man...

- que:
  - Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
  ans:
  - They g-got the wrong g-guy.

- que:
  - ...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer? You left your telephone number?
  ans:
  - Y-yes, sir.

- que:
  - Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
  ans:
  - No, s-sir.

- que:
  - Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
  ans:
  - Shu Kai Kim.

- que:
  - Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
  ans:
  - What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.

- que:
  - You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
  ans:
  - I see, He'd walk out next month.

- que:
  - We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is, Are you joking?
  ans:
  - I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.

- que:
  - Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
  ans:
  - Calls for speculation.

- que:
  - You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
  ans:
  - Badgering.

- que:
  - To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
  ans:
  - Objection.

- que:
  - -- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
  ans:
  - I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.

- que:
  - Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
  ans:
  - Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.

- que:
  - And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
  ans:
  - Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.

- que:
  - And who was Arturo Esparza?
  ans:
  - I don't think I know that name.

- que:
  - I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
  ans:
  - You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.

- que:
  - Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
  ans:
  - I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.

- que:
  - -- Eddie told you?
  ans:
  - My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.

- que:
  - You getting this?
  ans:
  - -- Every word.

- que:
  - Shouldn't one of us...?
  ans:
  - No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.

- que:
  - -- What trial?
  ans:
  - I followed you here from court.

- que:
  - ...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - -- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
  ans:
  - I would tend to plead the Fifth.

- que:
  - Mr. Ortega... What is \"La Compania\"?
  ans:
  - A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.

- que:
  - And its purpose?
  ans:
  - Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.

- que:
  - For control of the prison drug trade?
  ans:
  - I would tend to plead the Fifth.

- que:
  - Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we do some of that.

- que:
  - What is your rank within La Compania?
  ans:
  - \"Name, rank and serial,\" Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.

- que:
  - And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
  ans:
  - A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...

- que:
  - \"Materiel\"? What do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - Cigarettes, candy bars... PCP, crack...

- que:
  - If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
  ans:
  - ...A soldado, he takes care of it.

- que:
  - Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
  ans:
  - Soldado.

- que:
  - Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
  ans:
  - Shu's the only one I know of...

- que:
  - And why was an exception made?
  ans:
  - Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...

- que:
  - You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
  ans:
  - You're a l-lawyer? I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...

- que:
  - Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
  ans:
  - That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.

- que:
  - And you b-believe that.
  ans:
  - CIA?

- que:
  - Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
  ans:
  - Albert.

- que:
  - Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
  ans:
  - A woman.

- que:
  - What color hair will she have?
  ans:
  - Blonde.

- que:
  - You're describing half the high school girls in America. What is she doing right now?
  ans:
  - She is preparing a great abundance of food.

- que:
  - SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
  ans:
  - NO! GOD, NO...

- que:
  - Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
  ans:
  - I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.

- que:
  - Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
  ans:
  - I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around. If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.

- que:
  - I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
  ans:
  - Get lost Bobby.

- que:
  - Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
  ans:
  - Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11,00.

- que:
  - This isn't Mike. Is this Mike?
  ans:
  - Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.

- que:
  - What was?
  ans:
  - The stuff we got last night.

- que:
  - What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
  ans:
  - Don't get funny with me again.

- que:
  - Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
  ans:
  - We can do it right here.

- que:
  - That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
  ans:
  - Out back in our morgue.

- que:
  - Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
  ans:
  - We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.

- que:
  - Sam, get the body and put it in the van. Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
  ans:
  - My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.

- que:
  - Well, where are you going?
  ans:
  - I am going over here.

- que:
  - Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
  ans:
  - An old woman and her grandson.

- que:
  - Can you tell me what their names were?
  ans:
  - Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.

- que:
  - Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
  ans:
  - Yep, it sure is.

- que:
  - Did she have someone with her?
  ans:
  - Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.

- que:
  - Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
  ans:
  - No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff \"Not-Quite- Able\"... Here's the trailer now.

- que:
  - Is there a golf course around here?
  ans:
  - Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.

- que:
  - Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
  ans:
  - You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.

- que:
  - Did you know Teresa Banks?
  ans:
  - No you couldn't.

- que:
  - Smell something fishy, huh?
  ans:
  - Congratulations. I heard about that.

- que:
  - What is it, Gordon?
  ans:
  - COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.

- que:
  - Phillip?
  ans:
  - COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.

- que:
  - QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
  ans:
  - Teresa Banks.

- que:
  - ALBERT?
  ans:
  - It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.

- que:
  - Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
  ans:
  - I'm up to speed, Stanley.

- que:
  - And no one found the ring?
  ans:
  - No, sir, we did not.

- que:
  - Where is the ring?
  ans:
  - ANOTHER PLACE Someone else has it now.

- que:
  - Where am I? And how can I leave?
  ans:
  - ANOTHER PLACE You are here and there is no place to go...

- que:
  - Where's Hap?
  ans:
  - He's dead -- good and dead.

- que:
  - Any friends?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Ever see her with someone else?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did she ever mention any friends?
  ans:
  - No. Ask Irene over there.

- que:
  - How come Jack let's you work here?
  ans:
  - Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.

- que:
  - Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
  ans:
  - She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --

- que:
  - What happened to her?
  ans:
  - There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.

- que:
  - Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you take cocaine, Irene?
  ans:
  - No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.

- que:
  - He's with me. Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
  ans:
  - I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a \"freak accident\".

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?
  ans:
  - Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.

- que:
  - Shorthand. Really?
  ans:
  - We're heading into a difficult situation.

- que:
  - I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
  ans:
  - Lil was wearing a sour face.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Oh, the uncle is missing.

- que:
  - Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
  ans:
  - A blue rose.

- que:
  - What did Gordon's tie mean?
  ans:
  - What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.

- que:
  - Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
  ans:
  - He talks loud. And he loves his code.

- que:
  - Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other drawers?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Sam.

- que:
  - Accidental?
  ans:
  - Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It is a piece of paper with the letter \"T\" imprinted on it. Take a look.

- que:
  - Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
  ans:
  - We're not. You and I are going to get some food.

- que:
  - Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
  ans:
  - Agent Desmond, it's...

- que:
  - Are you speaking to me in a code?
  ans:
  - No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.

- que:
  - I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
  ans:
  - He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.

- que:
  - When he says, \"Discussion\", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Well, why not?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.

- que:

  ans:
  - Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.

  ans:
  - Fill 'er up.

- que:
  - Who would do that?
  ans:

- que:
  - What does Bob say?
  ans:
  - He wants to be me... or he will kill me.

- que:
  - Did you make me a tape?
  ans:
  - I already made you two tapes.

- que:
  - What? She asked about my father?
  ans:
  - Right on time, baby.

- que:
  - Laura, do you love me?
  ans:
  - Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.

- que:
  - You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
  ans:
  - James...

- que:
  - When am I going to see you?
  ans:
  - I've got to see you.

  - What?
  ans:
  - Bobby killed a guy.

- que:
  - See what?

  ans:
  - I don't want to offend the customs of your country.

  - I understand.

- que:
  - Sure honey, what's the hurry?
  ans:
  - I forgot my books at school.

  - What?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.

- que:
  - Dad?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you come home during the day last week?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Laura. What's wrong this morning?
  ans:
  - Stay away from me.

- que:
  - Leland, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Look at this finger here.

- que:
  - Did you get this from your lover?
  ans:
  - They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.

- que:
  - Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
  ans:
  - Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.

- que:
  - How do you know what she doesn't like?

- que:
  - What did he find?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - How good's your intelligence?
  ans:
  - Very good.

- que:
  - And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
  ans:
  - As far as we know, nothing.

- que:
  - If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
  ans:
  - Well, of course, it's always dangerous...

- que:
  - I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did you settle on the amount?
  ans:
  - We thought it was just.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - It looks that way.

- que:
  - To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
  ans:
  - ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.

- que:
  - What does it mean?
  ans:
  - They want to settle. It means a lot of money.

- que:
  - You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
  ans:
  - It's a crime.

- que:
  - You would not...?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
  ans:
  - I do. Yes.

- que:
  - You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
  ans:
  - Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.

- que:
  - Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
  ans:
  - That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.

- que:
  - Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
  ans:
  - Just as you are, Sir...

- que:
  - Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
  ans:
  - No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...

- que:
  - ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Neurology?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Orthopedics?
  ans:
  - I'm just an M.D.

- que:
  - Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
  ans:
  - I know of him.

- que:
  - How is that?
  ans:
  - Through, through his book.

- que:
  - What book is that?
  ans:
  - Meth... Methodology and Technique...

- que:
  - ...of Anesthesiology?
  ans:
  - Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.

- que:
  - How old are you?

- que:
  - ...to get her heartbeat back...?
  ans:
  - We've touched on this, his own witness has said...

- que:
  - Mr. Concannon...?
  ans:
  - Nothing further, your Honor.

- que:
  - Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
  ans:
  - Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

- que:
  - You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Anything special about the case?
  ans:
  - When she...

- que:
  - Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
  ans:
  - Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...

- que:
  - What did these people do when her heart stopped?
  ans:
  - We went to Code Blue...

- que:
  - Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
  ans:
  - Well, many reasons, actually...

- que:
  - Tell me one?
  ans:
  - She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...

- que:
  - ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
  ans:
  - My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...

- que:
  - You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are...?
  ans:
  - Hold on a second.

- que:
  - I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
  ans:
  - It's all right, Mickey.

- que:
  - Dr. Thompson...?
  ans:
  - It was good of you to meet...

- que:
  - Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
  ans:
  - It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

- que:
  - I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
  ans:
  - No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.

- que:
  - Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
  ans:
  - I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...

- que:
  - Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
  ans:
  - I am seventy-four years old.

- que:
  - What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
  ans:
  - I am on the staff of...

- que:
  - She getting good care over there?
  ans:
  - Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...

- que:
  - Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
  ans:
  - I. Yes. It is.

- que:
  - That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
  ans:
  - I read the hospital report on your client.

- que:
  - Right. Who called?
  ans:
  - The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...

- que:
  - ...and you're going to do that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You're going to settle out of court?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Her doctors killed her.

- que:
  - I'm sorry...?
  ans:
  - Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her.

- que:
  - Do you know who her doctors were?
  ans:
  - I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.

  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:

- que:
  - And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - I was held up.

- que:

  - Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
  ans:
  - Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.

  ans:
  - Laura.

- que:
  - What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
  ans:
  - You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.

- que:
  - The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
  ans:
  - I think I will.

- que:
  - Maybe what?
  ans:
  - Maybe I can do something right.

- que:
  - And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm going to try to do.

  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.

- que:
  - And what makes you so tough?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'll tell you later.

- que:
  - Is there going to be a later...?
  ans:
  - Not if you don't grow up...

- que:
  - What is that to you...?
  ans:
  - What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.

- que:
  - Is it over?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?

  - Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Huh. And why is that?
  ans:
  - Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...

- que:
  - Should I?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The Big Boy did...?
  ans:
  - Huh.

- que:
  - Looks almost cold now, don't it?
  ans:
  - That won't start no more fires. We might's well go home.

- que:
  - The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast. Anything from them yet?
  ans:
  - STAFF Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...

- que:
  - Is that it over there?
  ans:
  - Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.

- que:
  - Did you see it come down?
  ans:
  - Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.

- que:
  - Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
  ans:
  - What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?

- que:
  - Why, sure -- I got it! Do you have a match?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I don't smoke.

- que:
  - What's he like?
  ans:
  - Like...ah...

- que:
  - How does it happen cars are running?
  ans:
  - Automobile ignitions are insulated.

- que:
  - Would you like some coffee, General?
  ans:
  - We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there! I'll fly you over to Pasadena.

- que:
  - I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
  ans:
  - Can you handle one of these?

- que:
  - Is that... machine...?
  ans:
  - It's gone now.

- que:
  - I almost forget when I ate last. It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
  ans:
  - Where are we?

- que:
  - Don't you live at home?
  ans:
  - No, on the campus. I haven't any family.

- que:
  - I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
  ans:
  - How long was I out?

- que:
  - My kid brother has one. You know why?
  ans:
  - Yes ... Fits better in a football helmet.

- que:
  - I wonder if they're going through this too...?
  ans:
  - I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...

- que:
  - If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
  ans:
  - How could it happen to everybody's watch together?

- que:
  - Gratzman! -- Gratzman! Did you get those biotics?
  ans:
  - No. I thought you had them.

- que:
  - I got a message for you. You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
  ans:
  - My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.

- que:
  - That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
  ans:
  - It was nearer than that.

- que:
  - Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
  ans:
  - Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!

- que:
  - I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
  ans:
  - What'll we say to 'em?

- que:
  - Which means he's having nightmares again?
  ans:
  - He's very excited about it.

- que:
  - Can I read it?
  ans:
  - You mean that was a...

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So I don't know about horror.

- que:
  - I know. We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked. Look, how about we get in touch your agent. You still with Jerry?
  ans:
  - Yes, but...

- que:
  - And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?
  ans:
  - I don't follow.

- que:
  - Like weird calls, by any chance?
  ans:
  - Chase...

- que:
  - You get any sleep last night?
  ans:
  - More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed. I'm late.

- que:
  - Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
  ans:
  - Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.

- que:
  - Hasn't been another call, has there?
  ans:
  - Maybe. Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.

- que:
  - What if it isn't over?
  ans:
  - Maybe you should tell me your dream.

- que:
  - I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Guess so.

- que:
  - Heather?
  ans:
  - Chase. Hi...

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Chase, you'd better come home.

- que:
  - What? What kind of episode?
  ans:
  - He was just acting very strange. He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me. He was acting like...

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like Freddy.

- que:
  - Forget those two clowns, Heather. Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Any history of epilepsy in your family?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Diabetes?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Was there any trigger event? A trauma, shock or... You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you? The horror stuff?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Does he have to stay here over night?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him. Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
  ans:
  - Ms. Langenkamp. I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.

- que:
  - Is he all right?
  ans:
  - Dylan? He's holding well. Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...

- que:
  - If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
  ans:
  - It was an earthquake and it was dark. I have no idea.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He sleepwalks, you idiot! He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital. Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...

- que:
  - You going away?
  ans:
  - Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you.

- que:
  - Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
  ans:
  - Bye.

- que:
  - Rex? Who's Rex?
  ans:
  - Finish, please!

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The mean old man with the claws.

- que:
  - He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Mommy's fine, Dylan. Just had a bad dream. What're you doing out of bed?
  ans:
  - Rex woke me up. He was fighting.

- que:
  - Your bed?
  ans:
  - Under my covers. Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...

- que:
  - And...what's the man doing?
  ans:
  - Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.

- que:
  - Do you have to die to see God?
  ans:
  - No, I don't think so. You just have to...pray, or reach...

- que:
  - Why does God let there be bad things?
  ans:
  - I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.

- que:
  - Can you come with me in my dreams?
  ans:
  - Home.

- que:
  - You okay, champ?
  ans:
  - Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man's getting awful close.

- que:
  - Tell you what. I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now. You know home isn't far from here, right?
  ans:
  - Right 'cross the freeway.

- que:
  - You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
  ans:
  - Coming for you...

- que:
  - Dylan, where's the man?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - A story?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's a story. A story for a movie.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
  ans:
  - I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.

- que:
  - In what, a romantic comedy?
  ans:
  - Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.

- que:
  - Heather? You doing okay?
  ans:
  - Holding my own. You know that guy who was calling me all the time? He's started again. He's been putting stuff in my mail.

- que:
  - Yeah...how'd you know?
  ans:
  - Call it a guess...

- que:
  - Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
  ans:
  - Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least. I asked him at the funeral.

- que:
  - What...happened?
  ans:
  - Quake knocked you off your feet. You got bumped pretty good, actually.

- que:
  - Kids know when something's bugging a parent. You've got no idea who this is calling?
  ans:
  - Freddy, for all I know.

- que:
  - Holy...
  ans:
  - You really think Dylan's okay?

- que:
  - Where's Dylan?! Have you seen him?
  ans:
  - I know how Chase really died.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Fred Krueger did it.

- que:
  - 1 Is Chase Porter your husband?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The car's no there yet?
  ans:
  - No. I...listen, I can't make it in today.

- que:
  - You're kidding, right?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I can't.

- que:
  - Heather, what is it?
  ans:
  - Dunno. Just have this feeling today...

- que:
  - I'll call the cops for you. You've got the number on the fridge, right?
  ans:
  - Thanks. Just give them the time he called. They're keeping a list, supposedly. Sorry. My nerves are so raw these days.

- que:
  - No, Rex is not going to die. Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
  ans:
  - Sure. We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.

- que:
  - No, I don't think that at all. How is he?
  ans:
  - They wouldn't let me...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Killing innocence, one way or the other.

- que:
  - This is still a script we're talking about, right?
  ans:
  - I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.

- que:
  - Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
  ans:
  - It can be captured, sometimes.

- que:
  - Captured? How?
  ans:
  - Like the Genie in the bottle.

- que:
  - If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go? Another age? Another form?
  ans:
  - That's not what the dreams say he's doing.

- que:
  - Me? Why me?
  ans:
  - Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense. You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.

- que:
  - Dylan. And... Chase. My God, Wes, did you know?
  ans:
  - Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...

- que:
  - Choice? What kind of choice?
  ans:
  - Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.

- que:
  - Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
  ans:
  - No, not really. I...

- que:
  - Do you let your child watch your movies?
  ans:
  - My child? No...but...

- que:
  - And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I. Would you trust him alone with your child?
  ans:
  - Robert? I...

- que:
  - Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past!
  ans:
  - Yes?

- que:
  - Uh...sure...when?
  ans:
  - No time like the present. The car will bring you.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Just take a minute. You'll be glad you did, I bet.

- que:
  - Can I get you something to drink?
  ans:
  - Coffee'd be nice.

- que:
  - Sounds good. Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee? How you like it, Hon?
  ans:
  - Black's fine.

- que:
  - Did we lose anybody?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Your father?
  ans:
  - All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He never would have believed a woman like you existed.

- que:
  - Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
  ans:
  - Guilty.

- que:
  - Why did we begin this?
  ans:
  - We were idealists.

- que:
  - What are they doing?
  ans:
  - Yes, Sir.

- que:
  - Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
  ans:
  - I didn't know sir.

- que:
  - Why didn't you drop any sail?
  ans:
  - Skipper called us out of the rigging.

- que:
  - But your instinct was to lose sail?
  ans:
  - My instinct was to not get electrocuted.

- que:
  - How old are you, son?
  ans:
  - Fifteen.

- que:
  - Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
  ans:
  - You came back, Tod. You came back.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order.

- que:
  - Where's Mom?
  ans:
  - I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.

- que:
  - I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch. That sound good?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - Why don't you go and try some of that on?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Albatross?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Rick March. Who the hell are you?
  ans:
  - Gieg, Chuck.

- que:
  - What the \"Bowsprit Affair\"?
  ans:
  - Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - To take a piss.

- que:
  - Yeah, that's right. You wanna come in and shake it for me?
  ans:
  - If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.

- que:
  - Believe what?
  ans:
  - Her name. Bregitta. It's poetry.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. How'd you do.

- que:
  - Yes you could. You did. This is all you. Nobody else.
  ans:
  - What about you?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That we're going back. I don't want it to end. I don't want to be what I was when I left.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Anonymous.

- que:
  - Figured what out?
  ans:
  - Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.

- que:
  - You gonna jump? Or are you just having a last look?
  ans:
  - I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.

- que:
  - Hey, shut up will ya?
  ans:
  - It was a bad dream...

- que:
  - You only hurt yourself you know?
  ans:
  - Like you really care. Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.

- que:
  - Can we talk?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Is it true Phil?
  ans:
  - I gotta go.

- que:
  - Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't.

- que:
  - Do you have your ticket?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Passport?
  ans:
  - Look, I just better go.

- que:
  - What the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - Maybe it's an air raid.

- que:
  - How ya doing?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - I'm used to spending a lot of time alone. I guess that's what I thought it would be out here. But, it's not is it?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - Ya know... \"It\".

- que:
  - What'd you do?
  ans:
  - I said \"Sorry, wrong room\" and walked away.

- que:
  - Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you?
  ans:
  - Kennet Square, PA. 'Mushroom capital of the world'.

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - My dad.

- que:
  - It works?
  ans:
  - Swear to God. Only good advice he ever gave me. Now, go back to sleep.

- que:
  - Jesus, you never told them?
  ans:
  - I couldn't.

- que:
  - I can't make it out?
  ans:
  - I can't go in there.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - It was my fault. I slipped.

- que:
  - Face what?
  ans:
  - Uh, huh.

- que:
  - Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
  ans:
  - Sometimes it gets exciting out here.

- que:
  - Shouldn't we turn away?
  ans:
  - You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall. Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.

- que:
  - What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.

- que:
  - Sir...?
  ans:
  - Close the door. Sit down.

- que:
  - Why do you think I'm sending him home?
  ans:
  - He killed the dolphin.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - Of a fight he can't win out here.

- que:
  - I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is. What right did then have to show up here?
  ans:
  - They have every right Chuck.

- que:
  - Does Phil know how you guys feel?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Stow away?
  ans:
  - He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.

- que:
  - Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
  ans:
  - I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.

- que:
  - Is that what you were trained to do?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is it we can do for you today?
  ans:
  - Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.

- que:
  - What's wrong, you don't like steak?
  ans:
  - I should be eating with the crew.

- que:
  - I can take care of myself.
  ans:
  - Why are you here?

- que:
  - Oh, really?
  ans:
  - It has nothing to do with him.

- que:
  - It's okay. I'll be in, in a minute. Look, what do you want?
  ans:
  - I think you were too hard on Weathers.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yes. I do.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - A padlock.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - They'll know about it in the morning.

- que:
  - How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
  ans:
  - We'll think of something.

- que:
  - Why would you do that?
  ans:
  - I couldn't do it.

- que:
  - How would you know?
  ans:
  - Trust me donut. I know.

- que:
  - They tell you that?
  ans:
  - I figured it out.

- que:
  - Why, man?
  ans:
  - I don't have to listen to this.

- que:
  - You will if you wanna eat. Right George?
  ans:
  - That's not a satisfactory answer.

- que:
  - You know what he is talking about here?
  ans:
  - This isn't just a story!! It's history made allegory. It is a philosophical handbook for life! It holds the secret of this very voyage.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If it were only that simple, my young friend. Read on, gentlemen. Read on.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Barometer's dropping. The first blow'll come from the south. Might get interesting.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Fuck off man. It's just a fish.

- que:
  - About yourself?
  ans:
  - About anything.

- que:
  - How long you been standing there?
  ans:
  - Long enough.

- que:
  - You've gotta be kidding?
  ans:
  - But, they don't speak English.

- que:
  - The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
  ans:
  - Phil. What are you doing?

- que:
  - Do you have something to say?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Up you go. Right now.

- que:
  - What's it going to be?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry...

- que:
  - What are you blubbering about?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - What makes you so sure it was one?
  ans:
  - I can't be sure.

- que:
  - How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
  ans:
  - It wasn't hard.

- que:
  - And you didn't do anything about it?
  ans:
  - No. I didn't.

- que:
  - If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
  ans:
  - I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.

- que:
  - Then what are you trying to say then?
  ans:
  - Soon as we ship it'll be \"forgetta\".

- que:
  - Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
  ans:
  - How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.

- que:
  - So you're gonna be needin' the \"blue- bird\" pretty soon?
  ans:
  - Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

- que:
  - Y'all take American Express?
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - Well... Yeah - okay.

- que:
  - Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
  ans:
  - You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.

  ans:
  - Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.

- que:
  - How 'bout a beer?
  ans:
  - That'd be fine, Bobby.

  ans:
  - No, haven't heard of it.

- que:
  - You black?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You an indian?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
  ans:
  - Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.

- que:
  - Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
  ans:
  - No... I don't think so, man.

  ans:
  - Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.

  ans:
  - I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.

- que:
  - Don't think about it too long. You had enough?
  ans:
  - Have now.

- que:
  - Why should it?
  ans:

  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - No, of course.

- que:

  ans:
  - Mostly black though in that boogie place.

- que:
  - What's the name of it?
  ans:
  - Club Zanzibar.

- que:
  - You say it's straight ahead a mile?
  ans:
  - About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.

- que:
  - What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
  ans:
  - Set one up.

- que:
  - So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
  ans:

  ans:
  - No sir...

- que:
  - Whattaya do there?
  ans:
  - I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.

  - But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
  ans:

  - In what capacity?
  ans:
  - In many capacities.

- que:
  - Why not? How was the fishin'?
  ans:
  - I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Gotta admit, you guys are - two in four dozen.

- que:
  - Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
  ans:
  - Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.

- que:
  - What is it, Johnnie?
  ans:
  - Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em... Now tell me...

- que:

  ans:
  - Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.

  - This 'bout the fifth time?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.

- que:
  - What I made you do, mama?
  ans:
  - Nothin', honey. Mama's just actin' strange.

- que:
  - Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
  ans:
  - I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.

- que:
  - Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
  ans:
  - Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

- que:
  - Why we sittin' here, mama?
  ans:
  - Thinkin' a second, baby.

- que:
  - Why, honey?
  ans:
  - Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.

- que:
  - Stab it and steer.
  ans:
  - Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at \"The Hurricane.\"

- que:
  - What brand'd she smoke?
  ans:
  - Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.

- que:
  - Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
  ans:
  - But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.

- que:
  - You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
  ans:
  - I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.

- que:
  - So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
  ans:
  - No, he picked me up.

- que:
  - And you never told nobody about it?
  ans:
  - Here she goes again...

- que:
  - You okay, honey?
  ans:
  - That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...

- que:
  - I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
  ans:
  - Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.

- que:
  - That's good... Now go get yourself a beer. You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
  ans:
  - What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.

- que:
  - That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
  ans:
  - What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.

- que:
  - We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.

- que:
  - Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
  ans:
  - Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.

- que:
  - You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.

- que:
  - Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
  ans:
  - She got me an abortion...

- que:
  - You tell the boy who knocked you up?
  ans:
  - It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.

- que:
  - Actin' funny how?
  ans:
  - Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

- que:
  - One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
  ans:
  - Hell, peanut...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.

- que:
  - Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
  ans:
  - She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.

- que:
  - What'd you say to her?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
  ans:
  - I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.

- que:
  - It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
  ans:
  - They sure do stink.

- que:
  - Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
  ans:
  - Life is a bitch and then you marry one.

- que:
  - What kinda trash talk is that?
  ans:
  - What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.

- que:
  - That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
  ans:
  - Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.

- que:
  - Got anyplace special in mind?
  ans:
  - How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.

- que:
  - What's that, honey?
  ans:
  - There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.

- que:
  - Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
  ans:
  - Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!

- que:
  - We sure don't, honey... Get me a Mounds?
  ans:
  - You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.

- que:
  - What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
  ans:
  - It's just another case, Sailor.

- que:
  - What's that, peanut?
  ans:
  - One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.

- que:
  - My God, it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
  ans:
  - Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...

- que:
  - You certain?
  ans:
  - I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.

- que:
  - What was this one?
  ans:
  - It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.

- que:
  - Who do?
  ans:
  - Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.

- que:
  - He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
  ans:
  - Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.

- que:
  - Just part of life on the road, peanut.
  ans:
  - You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?

- que:
  - I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
  ans:
  - Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.

- que:
  - You ready for this?
  ans:
  - We'll find out in a hurry.

- que:
  - I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
  ans:
  - Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.

- que:
  - What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
  ans:
  - Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.

- que:
  - Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
  ans:
  - I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.

- que:
  - How much we got left, honey?
  ans:
  - Under a hundred.

- que:
  - You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
  ans:
  - Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.

- que:
  - This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
  ans:
  - What's that, peanut?

- que:
  - You knew my daddy?
  ans:
  - Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...

- que:
  - How'd you know my daddy?
  ans:
  - Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.

- que:
  - Lula, you there?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm here.

- que:
  - You upset with me?
  ans:
  - No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...

- que:
  - Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
  ans:
  - There's worse places, honey.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.

- que:
  - You think she's gonna make it?
  ans:
  - Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that... Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.

- que:
  - She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
  ans:
  - Let's get outta here, honey.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.

- que:
  - That you, Sail, honey?
  ans:
  - The only one.

- que:
  - You find any work?
  ans:
  - I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Come sit by me.

- que:
  - Anything I can do for you?
  ans:
  - No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.

- que:
  - Sailor? You know what?
  ans:
  - I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.

- que:
  - Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
  ans:
  - That smell's still fillin' this room good.

- que:
  - So where'd you say you was?
  ans:
  - Went with Bobby.

- que:
  - Uh-huh?
  ans:
  - Let's leave here.

- que:
  - What could I be up to, Lula?
  ans:
  - He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.

- que:
  - I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
  ans:
  - That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.

- que:
  - How can you say that, Sailor?
  ans:
  - You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.

- que:
  - Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
  ans:
  - If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.

- que:
  - I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
  ans:
  - Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.

- que:
  - What time's Sailor's train get in?
  ans:
  - Six.

- que:
  - Got any plans?
  ans:
  - Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.

- que:
  - What if I asked you not to?
  ans:
  - Wouldn't make any difference.

- que:
  - What if I told you not to?
  ans:
  - Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.

- que:
  - I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
  ans:
  - And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do about it?
  ans:
  - I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.

- que:
  - Take care of him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
  ans:
  - What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.

- que:
  - Get rid of him?
  ans:
  - Yes... Get rid of him.

- que:
  - Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
  ans:
  - Just tell me what you want.

- que:
  - Simple? Kill him? How?
  ans:
  - That's your business... I don't care how.

- que:
  - Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
  ans:
  - Santos...

- que:
  - Shoot him? Like with a gun?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where? In the leg?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In the head.

- que:
  - Through the forehead?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
  ans:
  - Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.

- que:
  - You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
  ans:
  - No... But...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Put your shoulders back, I said.

- que:
  - Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
  ans:
  - Shhhhhh... Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...

- que:
  - Where we goin'?
  ans:
  - Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.

- que:
  - ...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
  ans:
  - There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...

- que:
  - Whattya mean?
  ans:
  - Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.

- que:
  - Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
  ans:
  - Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...

- que:
  - By who?
  ans:
  - I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.

- que:
  - That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.

- que:
  - What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
  ans:
  - Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?

- que:
  - Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
  ans:
  - That's just how my brain works, I guess.

- que:
  - Hey. What are you guys doing here?
  ans:
  - We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.

- que:
  - I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
  ans:
  - The candelabras were my Gran's.

- que:
  - You all right, Professor Tripp?
  ans:
  - Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...

- que:
  - Emily?
  ans:
  - Your wife.

- que:
  - Perfect. Well then, shall we?
  ans:
  - Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.

- que:
  - Isn't she?
  ans:
  - It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.

- que:
  - Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.

- que:
  - You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip?
  ans:
  - It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

- que:
  - Trip?
  ans:
  - She left me. Crabs.

- que:
  - Left you...? Who? Emily?
  ans:
  - This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

- que:
  - But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
  ans:
  - I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.

- que:
  - Is that just beer?
  ans:
  - Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.

- que:
  - I'm sure. Where is everyone?
  ans:
  - Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

- que:
  - So. Is he any good?
  ans:
  - No. Not yet he isn't.

- que:
  - No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
  ans:
  - Shut up and drink.

- que:
  - What's this guy's problem?
  ans:
  - Just go around him.

- que:
  - You stay there.
  ans:
  - Where would we go?

- que:
  - Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
  ans:
  - Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

- que:
  - James? My James? What's happened?
  ans:
  - Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.

- que:
  - Kidnapped? By who?
  ans:
  - His parents.

- que:
  - Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
  ans:
  - Maybe... I don't know.

- que:
  - How bad is it for you?
  ans:
  - Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.

- que:
  - Which is?
  ans:
  - Competence.

- que:
  - What's to tell?
  ans:
  - Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

- que:
  - Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
  ans:
  - I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.

- que:
  - Is he awake?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

- que:
  - Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
  ans:
  - So what's the problem?

- que:
  - So -- what do we do now?
  ans:
  - Find the jacket.

- que:
  - Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
  ans:
  - First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.

- que:
  - Want some help with that?
  ans:
  - Don't touch it.

- que:
  - So whose car is it?
  ans:
  - My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.

- que:
  - The hood jumper?
  ans:
  - He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.

- que:
  - Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
  ans:
  - Call it a hunch.

- que:
  - Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
  ans:
  - Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.

- que:
  - Do you know he won't expel him?
  ans:
  - No. But I don't think that matters.

- que:
  - Me? What can I do?
  ans:
  - Gee, I don't know, Crabs... Improvise. You're good at that.

- que:
  - You peeked, didn't you?
  ans:
  - I peeked.

- que:
  - How are you -- is it Joe?
  ans:
  - Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.

- que:
  - This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
  ans:
  - It's mine.

- que:
  - How long have you been having them?
  ans:
  - The last month maybe.

- que:
  - How long have you been smoking marijuana?
  ans:
  - Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

- que:
  - That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
  ans:
  - I've been trying to finish a book...

- que:
  - Is that in my chart?
  ans:
  - I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.

- que:
  - So is my friend... is Sara still here?
  ans:
  - No. There's no one here.

- que:
  - No, really...
  ans:
  - Who's got a gun?

- que:
  - Who the hell is that?
  ans:
  - A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.

- que:
  - Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
  ans:
  - Fraid so.

- que:
  - Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Shoot.

- que:
  - As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
  ans:
  - Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

- que:
  - No sweat. Only do me a favor?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.

- que:
  - Could you hold on a minute, honey?
  ans:
  - Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

- que:
  - Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
  ans:
  - I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...

- que:
  - You're in Kinship?
  ans:
  - Yes. But that's not why I called...

- que:
  - With Emily?
  ans:
  - What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...

- que:
  - Just what? Doing a little dusting?
  ans:
  - ...reconcile with Emily.

- que:
  - Are you there to not reconcile with her?
  ans:
  - Goodbye, Grady.

- que:
  - Yea?
  ans:
  - How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

- que:
  - No! What gave you that idea?
  ans:
  - Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.

- que:
  - You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.

- que:
  - You cold, James?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - So what are you doing out here?
  ans:
  - It's colder in there.

- que:
  - Heaven?
  ans:
  - James. Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.

- que:
  - Is that really it?
  ans:
  - That's really it.

- que:
  - The one she wore on her wedding day?
  ans:
  - So I'm told.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.

- que:
  - He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
  ans:
  - I had to. Didn't I?

- que:
  - Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Yea, James.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.

- que:
  - Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
  ans:
  - I've got tenure.

- que:
  - Whose tuba is that anyway?
  ans:
  - Miss Sloviak's.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something about her?
  ans:
  - She is. Ah. Here we go...

- que:
  - Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
  ans:
  - Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. Have one.

- que:
  - Is he all right?
  ans:
  - Mmhmmm... knap... sap...

- que:
  - What's he saying?
  ans:
  - Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.

- que:
  - I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.

- que:
  - Want me to get that?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The guy on the phone.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.

- que:
  - What'd you tell him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Washed up?
  ans:
  - Blocked.

- que:
  - Professor Tripp?
  ans:
  - Hm.

- que:
  - How did I get here last night?
  ans:
  - No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

- que:
  - And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
  ans:
  - Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Well done, James.

- que:
  - So where have you been staying?
  ans:
  - The bus station.

- que:
  - But James. I mean... How long?
  ans:
  - A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I don't know... Me.

- que:
  - Isn't this...?
  ans:
  - Hm.

- que:
  - Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - She seemed to take it pretty well.

- que:
  - Humboldt County?
  ans:
  - Maybe...

- que:
  - Glaucoma?
  ans:
  - Colon cancer.

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - Carvel.

- que:
  - Carvel? Where's Carvel?
  ans:
  - Outside Scranton.

- que:
  - Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
  ans:
  - Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.

- que:
  - What kind of dancer?
  ans:
  - Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

- que:
  - Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
  ans:
  - When we fall, we fall hard.

- que:
  - This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
  ans:
  - Kinship.

- que:
  - Kinship. And what's here?
  ans:
  - Unless I miss my bet... my wife.

- que:
  - The one that left you?
  ans:
  - That's right. That one.

- que:
  - How can you tell?
  ans:
  - You can see the outline of a butt.

- que:
  - I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
  ans:
  - Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.

- que:
  - It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's -- Who said anything about girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.

- que:
  - I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does? Why do you wear that coat?
  ans:
  - It's warm.

- que:
  - Because of my coat?
  ans:
  - Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.

- que:
  - Jealous? Of me?
  ans:
  - But, last night...

- que:
  - You coming?
  ans:
  - In a minute. Get us a table.

- que:
  - Want a bite?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - I eat.
  ans:
  - What would you call them then?

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - When nobody's looking.

- que:
  - You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

- que:
  - Near Carvel?
  ans:
  - Get out of here.

- que:
  - Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
  ans:
  - Ah, wear whatever you want.

- que:
  - Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
  ans:
  - It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.

- que:
  - I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
  ans:
  - I'm a little worried, James.

- que:
  - Professor Tripp...?
  ans:
  - Yes, James.

- que:
  - Me? Sure. Why?
  ans:
  - Just checking.

- que:
  - The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
  ans:
  - James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

- que:
  - Do?
  ans:
  - I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.

- que:
  - Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
  ans:
  - I would if I knew where I was taking him.

- que:
  - Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
  ans:
  - Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.

- que:
  - No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.

- que:
  - Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
  ans:
  - Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?

- que:
  - The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
  ans:
  - I told you, Sewickly Heights.

- que:
  - That good, huh?
  ans:
  - Walter just got it back from the framer today.

- que:
  - Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
  ans:
  - I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.

- que:
  - Is that Cristaile?
  ans:
  - Hm.

- que:
  - My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't, she?
  ans:
  - If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.

- que:
  - Has he asked to see the book yet?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And? Are you going to tell him?
  ans:
  - No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.

- que:
  - Not have it.
  ans:
  - You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?

- que:
  - No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
  ans:
  - Well, no, I don't see any way. And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.

- que:
  - Who's gun is that?
  ans:
  - It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

- que:
  - Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
  ans:
  - I heard.

- que:
  - You heard? How?
  ans:
  - A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.

- que:
  - Did you confess?
  ans:
  - Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

- que:
  - I'm kidding. Hello?
  ans:
  - Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...

- que:
  - Are you limping? Why are you limping?
  ans:
  - Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...

- que:
  - Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
  ans:
  - No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.

- que:
  - Who's that sitting in your car?
  ans:
  - James Leer.

- que:
  - What's he doing out there?
  ans:
  - I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Inside.

- que:
  - And the jacket?
  ans:
  - Over there. In the backseat of the...

- que:
  - Are you sure you parked it there?
  ans:
  - Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.

- que:
  - Would Walter really press charges?
  ans:
  - It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.

- que:
  - You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
  ans:
  - I think I might have.

- que:
  - And what do you think you might have said?
  ans:
  - I think I might've said I was in love with you.

- que:
  - And what did you say?
  ans:
  - I said it didn't sound like you.

- que:
  - I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
  ans:
  - I'm through improvising.

- que:
  - Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
  ans:
  - I lost it all.

- que:
  - Ouch. How many?
  ans:
  - Dozens. It's very sad.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - I guess you have to go on faith.

- que:
  - Did you tell Walter?
  ans:
  - I told Walter.

- que:
  - Does he still love you?
  ans:
  - It didn't come up.

- que:
  - Did you just make that up?
  ans:
  - In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.

- que:
  - Why yes. How did you know?
  ans:
  - Lucky guess.

- que:
  - Who's he barking at now?
  ans:
  - He's still barking at me. He's blind.

- que:
  - Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
  ans:
  - James is... I don't know...

- que:
  - Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
  ans:
  - He's writing his name in water.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.

- que:
  - Jesus. Is that what he told you?
  ans:
  - He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...

- que:
  - Who's this ?
  ans:
  - It's Grady, Walter.

- que:
  - Grady?
  ans:
  - GRADY Tripp. English Department.

- que:
  - I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
  ans:
  - It's three-thirty, Grady.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - I... I...

- que:
  - What is it, Grady?
  ans:
  - I'm in love with your wife.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Sara. I'm in love with her.

- que:
  - Is it good?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It might be...

- que:
  - Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.

- que:
  - Who's that guy?
  ans:
  - Her husband.

- que:
  - What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
  ans:
  - Taking the long way home.

- que:
  - Do you get high, Sam?
  ans:
  - Only when I'm working.

- que:
  - Holy shit. Are you serious?
  ans:
  - As a heart attack.

- que:
  - What made you pull out that old thing?
  ans:
  - I was thinking of you.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.

- que:
  - Where's Emily, Hank?
  ans:
  - I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.

- que:
  - Where you stand?
  ans:
  - I -- just want to say I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.

- que:
  - Horses, right. Vernon something... Hardapple.
  ans:
  - Why did you come here, Grady?

- que:
  - I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.

- que:
  - George Sanders?
  ans:
  - Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

- que:
  - I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
  ans:
  - I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.

- que:
  - You doing okay?
  ans:
  - Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.

- que:
  - Yeah, you still with Northland?
  ans:
  - Foreman now.

- que:
  - Beautiful. How's business?
  ans:
  - Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...

- que:
  - Hey, is that a school?
  ans:
  - K through sixth.

- que:
  - Something wrong with that?
  ans:
  - I was just thinking of... the noise.

- que:
  - I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - Annette? She's good... tense.

- que:
  - When can I see her?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it.

- que:
  - Is it because of Anna?
  ans:
  - I don't know. She won't talk about it.

- que:
  - How old is Anna?
  ans:
  - She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - This little table is one heavy bitch.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.

- que:
  - Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's really nice.

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.

- que:
  - What party?
  ans:
  - The birthday party.

- que:
  - I've got some pictures. Want to see?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Annette will see you.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Soon.

- que:
  - Next week? The week after?
  ans:
  - Early July.

- que:
  - Isn't it?
  ans:
  - The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.

- que:
  - Carlos, can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean... feelings.

- que:
  - What are you looking at?
  ans:
  - Birds.

- que:
  - There's little chicks! You want to see?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - I don't like starlings.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.

- que:
  - You always carry these?
  ans:
  - When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.

- que:
  - How does it sound?
  ans:
  - It's hard to describe.

- que:
  - Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too?
  ans:
  - Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.

- que:
  - Were you watching me?
  ans:
  - Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.

- que:
  - Do you come here often?
  ans:
  - My daddy likes me home before dark.

- que:
  - See anything interesting?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - What are you writing in that book?
  ans:
  - It's my bird book.

- que:
  - Don't you have friends?
  ans:
  - I have friends.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Have a seat.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - Why don't you just tell me?
  ans:
  - I haven't broken any laws.

- que:
  - Doesn't everybody?
  ans:
  - I could get a search warrant.

- que:
  - Cherry?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You can't talk to me like --
  ans:
  - Who said I wanted to buy it?

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.

- que:
  - You going to take me on a nature walk?
  ans:
  - I fell asleep.

- que:
  - Do you believe in them?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The one with the ax?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The girl.

- que:
  - I'll be asking the questions. Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
  ans:
  - I was asleep.

- que:
  - What's with the boxes?
  ans:
  - You're a cop. Figure it out.

- que:
  - The passionate one?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You sure you don't know nothing about this?
  ans:
  - Fraid not.

- que:
  - So. How are you adjusting?
  ans:
  - I'm adjusting okay.

- que:
  - And your new apartment?
  ans:
  - Apartment's okay.

- que:
  - Are you taking your medication?
  ans:
  - It gives me headaches.

- que:
  - But you are taking it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Sergeant Lucas. May I come in?
  ans:
  - You are in.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.

- que:
  - Lovers' quarrel?
  ans:
  - People have the right to know.

- que:
  - Can I ask how old you are?
  ans:
  - I'm twelve.

- que:
  - Do you have many friends?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.

- que:
  - Would you like to sit on my lap?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure. Thank you all the same.

- que:
  - Do you want me to sit on your lap?
  ans:
  - They sound like finches.

- que:
  - Does he?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - Ms. Kramer.

- que:
  - What will happen if I do?
  ans:
  - Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.

- que:
  - But will he... ?
  ans:
  - Your daddy will always love you.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I know because... it's just something I know.

- que:
  - Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can't I stay a little longer?
  ans:
  - It's getting dark. Go home.

- que:
  - And how's your job?
  ans:
  - The job's okay.

- que:
  - Do I take \"okay\" to mean you feel good about working there?
  ans:
  - I said the job is okay.

- que:
  - That's right, you did. Have you made any friends there?
  ans:
  - I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'd like you to keep a journal.

- que:
  - A diary?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Try it.

- que:
  - How's the journal?
  ans:
  - I'm still thinking about it.

- que:
  - You don't like coming here, do you?
  ans:
  - It's okay.

- que:
  - Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
  ans:
  - Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.

- que:
  - Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - How do you feel about that?
  ans:
  - I don't feel anything.

- que:
  - Then why are you talking about this?
  ans:
  - Have to talk about something.

- que:
  - What are you afraid will happen?
  ans:
  - I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.

- que:
  - Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
  ans:
  - I'm not that crazy.

- que:
  - Why do you think you're here?
  ans:
  - You know why. It's part of the parole deal.

- que:
  - Is that what you are angry about?
  ans:
  - Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.

- que:
  - How long is this going to take?
  ans:
  - We have a few more minutes.

- que:
  - Will I ever be normal?
  ans:
  - I couldn't say.

- que:
  - Do you know what \"normal\" is?
  ans:
  - I suppose it's however society defines it.

- que:
  - How do you define it?
  ans:
  - I don't.

- que:
  - Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
  ans:
  - They usually tell me.

- que:
  - What is your idea of being a Jew?
  ans:
  - Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you. Why don't we continue this on Thursday.

- que:
  - What did you think would happen?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
  ans:
  - What did you want to happen?

- que:
  - We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
  ans:
  - Is this the first one?

- que:
  - Remember when you asked me what my idea of \"normal\" was?
  ans:
  - Go home, Walter.

- que:
  - You mean my problem?
  ans:
  - If by \"problem\" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'd like you to close your eyes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To relax.

- que:
  - Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
  ans:
  - Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?

- que:
  - In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
  ans:
  - When I say the word \"girl\" what is the earliest image that you can remember?

- que:
  - Who do you see?
  ans:
  - I see my sister.

- que:
  - Sorry. Where is she?
  ans:
  - In my bedroom, sleeping.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - In my bed too.

- que:
  - How old are you and your sister?
  ans:
  - We're little kids.

- que:
  - But roughly, how old?
  ans:
  - I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.

- que:
  - And what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just lying there. We're taking a nap.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
  ans:
  - A nap?

- que:
  - Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up! I smelled her hair.
  ans:
  - Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.

- que:
  - I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
  ans:
  - Did you get an erection?

- que:
  - Accept you?
  ans:
  - It's going to take time, Walter.

- que:
  - How do you feel about that?
  ans:
  - I feel... okay.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

- que:
  - Want a ride?
  ans:
  - I'm all right.

- que:
  - What picture?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about you.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you.

- que:
  - What's weird about that?
  ans:
  - Most women wouldn't choose it.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Southern light.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.

- que:
  - You plan to drink both those beers?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Is that a school?
  ans:
  - K through sixth.

- que:
  - Doesn't it get noisy?
  ans:
  - I like the noise.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - They could eat you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're damaged.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I'm not easily shocked.

- que:
  - Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
  ans:
  - It's been a while since...

- que:
  - Since you've had sex?
  ans:
  - Tell me about it.

- que:
  - The morning?
  ans:
  - I thought I'd stay the night.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.

- que:
  - Did I say something wrong?
  ans:
  - I suffer from insomnia.

- que:
  - Is that all?
  ans:
  - When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.

- que:
  - I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
  ans:
  - Hey, there.

- que:
  - Why do you want to know?
  ans:
  - Because I like you.

- que:
  - The worst?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So, what did you do?
  ans:
  - I molested little girls.

- que:
  - Molested little girls?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How many girls did you molest?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - What did you do to them?
  ans:
  - It's not what you think.

- que:
  - How young?
  ans:
  - I never hurt them. Never.

- que:
  - Why don't you just go now, okay?
  ans:
  - I told you I'm not easily shocked.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Get your kicks somewhere else.

- que:
  - You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
  ans:
  - No. Never again.

- que:
  - Yes! I want to know.
  ans:
  - What was prison like?

- que:
  - You mean the time you're locked away?
  ans:
  - No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.

- que:
  - Why young girls, Walter?
  ans:
  - Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...

- que:
  - They seduce you?
  ans:
  - I was always the one seduced.

- que:
  - You really believe that?
  ans:
  - No. That's what I used to tell myself.

- que:
  - And what do you tell yourself now?
  ans:
  - Nothing. It's over.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Being here, with me.

- que:
  - For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
  ans:
  - What odds?

- que:
  - Why not tell me now?
  ans:
  - I got poked around... here and there.

- que:
  - Which brother did this?
  ans:
  - All three -- in chronological order.

- que:
  - Not ever?
  ans:
  - Not ever.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Us seeing each other.

- que:
  - Who doesn't?
  ans:
  - Most people don't have my kind of problems.

- que:
  - What's it look like?
  ans:
  - I don't need a plant.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - Sneak up behind me like that.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Do you want to talk about it?
  ans:
  - I need a shower.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Goddamnit! D'you tell him we need it right now?
  ans:
  - I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.

- que:
  - We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state-room. Otherwise it was bunks.
  ans:
  - Where're you?

- que:
  - Okay, good reason. Then what?
  ans:
  - No way that could just be seawater.

- que:
  - How you guys doing?
  ans:
  - I'm alright, I'm dealing.

- que:
  - You got it?! You got it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning.

- que:
  - What is that? You drop your dive light?
  ans:
  - Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.

- que:
  - Where are we?
  ans:
  - Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes.

- que:
  - Hey, you okay?
  ans:
  - Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.

- que:
  - Thanks. How you feeling, big guy?
  ans:
  - Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.

- que:
  - I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here. Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
  ans:
  - My rig. I designed the damn thing.

- que:
  - Who else?
  ans:
  - I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down. Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

- que:
  - You wanna know what I think?
  ans:
  - Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.

- que:
  - What are you still wearing that for?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to take it off.

- que:
  - So what about \"Michael\" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him?
  ans:
  - No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more.

- que:
  - Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything?
  ans:
  - No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - But you think it's something else. What? One of ours?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Cute, Virgil.
  ans:
  - But what did he see that made him panic?

- que:
  - What's the scoop, ace?
  ans:
  - I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.

- que:
  - What about O-2?
  ans:
  - Brace yourself. We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.

- que:
  - I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
  ans:
  - I think it likes you.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.

- que:
  - Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
  ans:
  - You owe me one, Virgil.

- que:
  - You totaled it, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. So sue me.

- que:
  - You see where it's coming in?
  ans:
  - Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.

- que:
  - Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
  ans:
  - I don't know, look around.

- que:
  - Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan...
  ans:
  - How?

- que:
  - WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!?
  ans:
  - It is insane.

- que:
  - Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
  ans:
  - Hi, lady.

- que:
  - Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
  ans:
  - Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.

- que:
  - I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay?
  ans:
  - No, Bud, no... not you.

- que:
  - Who then?
  ans:
  - Hello, Brigman.

- que:
  - Did you find Wilhite?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Virgil?
  ans:
  - God, I hate that bitch.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident. Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.

- que:
  - Do we just leave him there?
  ans:
  - Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get something to breathe.

- que:
  - Why bring it here?
  ans:
  - Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it.

- que:
  - Yeah. The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
  ans:
  - Got it. Over.

- que:
  - Is that it? Is this right?
  ans:
  - Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way.

- que:
  - Missed what?
  ans:
  - Y'all could be more specific.

- que:
  - Turn it up, bozo.
  ans:
  - What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?

- que:
  - That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
  ans:
  - Are we talkin' little space friend here?

- que:
  - Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
  ans:
  - Just checking is out, huh? How come?

- que:
  - Just hold your water, okay? So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
  ans:
  - We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

- que:
  - Cab One, radiation readings?
  ans:
  - Neutron counter's not showing very much.

- que:
  - Copy that, continuing forward. You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
  ans:
  - Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We're on a tight timeline.

- que:
  - How many are there?
  ans:
  - 24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.

- que:
  - You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
  ans:
  - Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.

- que:
  - Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You, Lindsey?
  ans:
  - Cab Three, check. Right behind you.

- que:
  - What's you depth, Cab Three?
  ans:
  - 1840... 50... 60... 70...

- que:
  - Figured that out for yourself, did you?
  ans:
  - A non-terrestrial intelligence.

- que:
  - Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
  ans:
  - Let's go for it. We could get lucky.

- que:
  - Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?
  ans:
  - Uh, oh...

- que:
  - What kind of luminous things, Bud?
  ans:
  - Fluid breathing system. We just got them. We use it if we need to go really deep.

- que:
  - How deep?
  ans:
  - Deep. It's classified... you know. Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.

- que:
  - Getting a reading?
  ans:
  - High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.

- que:
  - 8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?
  ans:
  - Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

- que:
  - What kind of light?
  ans:
  - He's hallucinating badly.

- que:
  - Would we see the flash?
  ans:
  - Through three miles of water? I don't know.

- que:
  - When do you have to go back?
  ans:
  - I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...

- que:
  - I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
  ans:
  - Then how come you're not with him?

- que:
  - Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
  ans:
  - Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.

- que:
  - Wait for what?
  ans:
  - Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.

- que:
  - But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
  ans:
  - There will be plenty of time to talk about it later. We'll get married soon. That way we'll have more time...

- que:
  - But where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm thirsty.

- que:
  - Did you sleep well?
  ans:
  - Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.

- que:
  - Which one shall I wear?
  ans:
  - This one is gorgeous.

- que:
  - Claudia, aren't you coming?
  ans:
  - I'm certainly not going to swim across.

- que:
  - Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
  ans:
  - No, Dad, it isn't.

- que:
  - And how long will you be away?
  ans:
  - Four or five days.

- que:
  - Used to what?
  ans:
  - To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.

- que:
  - And have you any other truths to tell me?
  ans:
  - You already know what they are.

- que:
  - It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
  ans:
  - It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.

- que:
  - And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
  ans:
  - Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.

- que:
  - What is that one over there called?
  ans:
  - That must be Basiluzzo.

- que:
  - At what?
  ans:
  - At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.

- que:
  - Have you decided?
  ans:
  - All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.

- que:
  - More so than the shark?
  ans:
  - There's no comparison.

- que:
  - But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
  ans:
  - Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?

- que:
  - Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
  ans:
  - Maybe you'd better ask him.

- que:
  - But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
  ans:
  - There's nothing much to laugh at.

- que:
  - Shall we go for a swim?
  ans:
  - Oh, no... please... not here. It looks too dangerous.

- que:
  - I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
  ans:
  - Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.

- que:
  - Find anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And why do you tell us this only now?
  ans:
  - I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...

- que:
  - But why don't you tell him? A girl who was with us has disappeared.
  ans:
  - And how do you explain that?

- que:
  - And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.

- que:
  - Are you feeling better?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.

- que:
  - You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, very much so.

- que:
  - Has she ever spoken to you about me?
  ans:
  - Occasionally, but always with affection.

- que:
  - Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
  ans:
  - I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
  ans:
  - It takes even less.

- que:
  - And what about you?
  ans:
  - Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.

- que:
  - Any news?
  ans:
  - Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...

- que:
  - What is it, Claudia?
  ans:
  - Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...

- que:
  - Does it please you to say such things?
  ans:
  - Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...

- que:
  - Then why do you say them?
  ans:
  - Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now, \"Claudia, I love you,\" I would believe you...

- que:
  - Why are you looking at me like that?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.

- que:
  - Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
  ans:
  - You look at me as though I had said something foolish...

- que:
  - And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
  ans:
  - That's why I asked you...

- que:
  - But why am I so infatuated with you?
  ans:
  - Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...

- que:
  - So, you wonder why?
  ans:
  - Then I'll see you later.

- que:
  - Sandro ...What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - No reason why...

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.

- que:
  - Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
  ans:
  - Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...

- que:
  - Aren't you going to change?
  ans:
  - You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm too sleepy.

- que:
  - You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Late, very late.

- que:
  - Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
  ans:
  - I would say he's pretty depraved.

- que:
  - He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
  ans:
  - One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.

- que:
  - Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
  ans:
  - What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.

- que:
  - To do what?
  ans:
  - It was futile. We went all over.

- que:
  - Do you consider that a compliment?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
  ans:
  - Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.

- que:
  - What do you mean by sensible?
  ans:
  - It means being without money.

- que:
  - Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
  ans:
  - I imagine he must be inside sleeping.

- que:
  - Who are you talking to?
  ans:
  - To the shark.

- que:
  - Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
  ans:
  - They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.

- que:
  - But why all nudes?
  ans:
  - It couldn't be any clearer.

- que:
  - Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
  ans:
  - I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.

- que:
  - But Corrado... If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
  ans:
  - He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.

- que:
  - But why?... What if it starts to rain?
  ans:
  - If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.

- que:
  - Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
  ans:
  - Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.

- que:
  - But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
  ans:
  - When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.

- que:
  - Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
  ans:
  - Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.

- que:
  - And what are we going to do now?
  ans:
  - We'll try again.

- que:
  - So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
  ans:
  - I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.

- que:
  - But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
  ans:
  - I think it's possible.

- que:
  - This is Claudia, Anna's friend... You've never met my husband, have you?
  ans:
  - First let the poor thing have something to eat.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.

- que:
  - Where is she going?
  ans:
  - Ask her.

- que:
  - I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
  ans:
  - Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.

- que:
  - And where do you find the models?
  ans:
  - Oh, there are as many as one wants.

- que:
  - I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
  ans:
  - It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.

- que:
  - Why don't you try?
  ans:
  - Me... Goffredo, you're mad! He's mad.

- que:
  - Don't you ever paint men?
  ans:
  - Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.

- que:
  - They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.

- que:
  - Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
  ans:
  - I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...

- que:
  - And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
  ans:
  - Yes, she takes care of the garden.

- que:
  - And what did they say about me?
  ans:
  - They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.

- que:
  - And why wouldn't we have one like this?
  ans:
  - Because this is a Chinese radio.

- que:
  - But for you, what comes first, music or love?
  ans:
  - Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.

- que:
  - Anything new develop?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately, no.

- que:
  - And do you remember where she got off?
  ans:
  - Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.

- que:
  - Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
  ans:
  - There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...

- que:
  - Are you the owner of this place?
  ans:
  - No. The owners are in Australia.

- que:
  - Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
  ans:
  - At this time of the year there are so many boats...

- que:
  - Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
  ans:
  - Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...

- que:
  - Patrizia, what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.

- que:
  - And here's Sandro. Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
  ans:
  - Yes, we will.

- que:
  - Did you manage to find good rooms?
  ans:
  - They didn't seem too good.

- que:
  - Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
  ans:
  - I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.

- que:
  - Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
  ans:
  - Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.

- que:
  - Zuria?
  ans:
  - Yes. Until proven otherwise.

- que:
  - Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
  ans:
  - I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.

- que:
  - Is that far from here?
  ans:
  - About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.

- que:
  - Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
  ans:
  - Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.

- que:
  - He talked to you Himself?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Through someone else?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I can't say.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - She'd punish me.

- que:
  - One of the other Sisters?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Because I'm getting fat.

- que:
  - Who told you this?
  ans:
  - It's a sin to be fat.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Look at the statues, they're thin.

- que:
  - Who tells you these things?
  ans:
  - Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
  ans:
  - Yes Mother.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.

- que:
  - Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
  ans:
  - I burnt them.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - They were stained.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's not my time of month.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I don't know...

- que:
  - Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Was it Sister Marguerite?
  ans:
  - No I'm not.

- que:
  - Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
  ans:
  - Let's talk about something else.

- que:
  - Anything... may I sit down?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - First thing that comes to your mind?
  ans:
  - God! But there's nothing to say about God.

- que:
  - Have you ever loved anyone?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Everyone.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Oh, there are so many.

- que:
  - Do you think he loves you?
  ans:
  - Oh, I know he does.

- que:
  - He's told you?
  ans:
  - No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.

- que:
  - You've been alone together?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Often?
  ans:
  - At least once a week.

- que:
  - And you like that?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - Where do you meet?
  ans:
  - In the confessional.

- que:
  - Would you like to talk about it?
  ans:
  - I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.

- que:
  - Why should they?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Do you remember the night they said it came?
  ans:
  - No. I was sick.

- que:
  - How were you sick?
  ans:
  - Something I ate.

- que:
  - Did it hurt?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Down... there.

- que:
  - And what did you do?
  ans:
  - I went to my room.

- que:
  - And what happened?
  ans:
  - I got sicker.

- que:
  - And then what?
  ans:
  - I fell asleep.

- que:
  - In the middle of all the pain?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What baby?
  ans:
  - The baby they made up.

- que:
  - Where'd it come from before that?
  ans:
  - From God.

- que:
  - Don't you know?
  ans:
  - Yes I do, but I want you to...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Just that... you ask and I'll answer.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - What's your real name?
  ans:
  - Martha Louise Livingston.

- que:
  - Are you married?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Would you like to be?
  ans:
  - Not at the moment, no.

- que:
  - Do you have any children?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Would you like some?
  ans:
  - I can't have them any more.

- que:
  - Does it bother you?
  ans:
  - No questions.

- que:
  - Where do you think babies come from?
  ans:
  - From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.

- que:
  - Why should I?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You liked Sister Paul?
  ans:
  - She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.

- que:
  - What else did she tell you?
  ans:
  - She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.

- que:
  - Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often?
  ans:
  - No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.

- que:
  - I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
  ans:
  - I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.

- que:
  - What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's even more wonderful then.

- que:
  - Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
  ans:
  - No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.

- que:
  - You have trouble sleeping?
  ans:
  - I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.

- que:
  - What things?
  ans:
  - She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.

- que:
  - How did she know that?
  ans:
  - Somebody told her.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
  ans:
  - An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.

- que:
  - Did your mother see angels often?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you believe she really saw them?
  ans:
  - No, but I can never tell her that.

- que:
  - Why not? Mmm?
  ans:
  - She'd get angry.

- que:
  - Agnes, did you love your mother?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
  ans:
  - I could never be a mother.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I don't want one.

- que:
  - If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
  ans:
  - From someone who didn't want to have a baby.

- que:
  - How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
  ans:
  - A mistake...

- que:
  - Agnes, how did your mother get you?
  ans:
  - A mistake... it was a mistake...

- que:
  - Is that what she said?
  ans:
  - Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...

- que:
  - What the child?
  ans:
  - Everything... I don't have children.

- que:
  - But you're troubled... aren't you?
  ans:
  - That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.

- que:
  - Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
  ans:
  - Agnes...

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I'm always bad.

- que:
  - I breathed!
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - She's dead isn't she?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - She watches... she listens.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - ... makes me...

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.

- que:
  - She tells you you're ugly?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And that you're stupid?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That you're a mistake?
  ans:
  - She says my whole body's a mistake.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.

- que:
  - How does she know that?
  ans:
  - Her headaches.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more.

- que:
  - Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
  ans:
  - No I'm not.

- que:
  - Are you pretty?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you intelligent?
  ans:
  - Yes I am.

- que:
  - Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
  ans:
  - I really love you.

- que:
  - As much as Mother Miriam does?
  ans:
  - As much as God loves you.

- que:
  - Who am I?
  ans:
  - Doctor Livingston.

- que:
  - And why am I here?
  ans:
  - To help me.

- que:
  - Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
  ans:
  - Because I'm in trouble.

- que:
  - What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?
  ans:
  - I'm frightened.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - Of telling you.

- que:
  - But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
  ans:
  - I had a baby.

- que:
  - How did you have a baby?
  ans:
  - It came out of me.

- que:
  - Did you know what was going to come out?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you want it to come out?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I was afraid.

- que:
  - Why were you afraid?
  ans:
  - Because I wasn't worthy.

- que:
  - To be a mother?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
  ans:
  - It grew.

- que:
  - What made it grow? Do you know?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Would you like to tell me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did anyone else know about the baby?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you that.

- que:
  - Will she be angry?
  ans:
  - She made me promise not to.

- que:
  - Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
  ans:
  - Fish... ... brussel sprouts.

- que:
  - You don't like brussel sprouts?
  ans:
  - I hate them.

- que:
  - And then what happened?
  ans:
  - We went to chapel for vespers.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Someone's following me.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Sister Marguerite I think.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - A crucifix.

- que:
  - Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
  ans:
  - A wastepaper basket.

- que:
  - Do you know who put it there?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you think it's there for?
  ans:
  - For me to get sick in.

- que:
  - Are you ill?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do you feel?
  ans:
  - I feel as if I've eaten glass.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I have to throw up...

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water...

- que:
  - Why isn't anyone coming?
  ans:
  - They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Go away, I don't want you here.

- que:
  - Is someone in the room with you?
  ans:
  - No... don't hit me please...

- que:
  - Do you remember what just happened?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Agnes, can you hear me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did she mean?
  ans:
  - The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.

- que:
  - And the passage to the barn?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - So I could go to him.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Him.

- que:
  - How did she know about him?
  ans:
  - She'd seen him too.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - From the belltower the day she before she died.

- que:
  - So she sent you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you frightened?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Agnes who did you see?
  ans:
  - I hate him...

- que:
  - Of course you do. Who was it?
  ans:
  - I hate him for what he did to me.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I hate him.

- que:
  - Agnes, who did this to you?
  ans:
  - God! It was God. And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.

- que:
  - It was alive wasn't it?
  ans:
  - I don't remember.

- que:
  - Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - She took the baby in her arms?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You saw it all didn't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I put her to sleep.

- que:
  - H... how?
  ans:
  - I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look into the convent records.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - The bishop is breathing down our necks.

- que:
  - And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
  ans:
  - Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.

- que:
  - Marty, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Larry there's got to be something missing.

- que:
  - I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
  ans:
  - Something they... that they overlooked.

- que:
  - What? You think that the girl is innocent?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You're too involved Marty. Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - You have proof?
  ans:
  - I'll have it.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Next week.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - It's Martha, Mama. There you go.

- que:
  - Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
  ans:
  - I... I'm Martha, Mama.

- que:
  - How do you survive?
  ans:
  - Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, some wheat, corn, some vegetables.

- que:
  - Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
  ans:
  - No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.

- que:
  - Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
  ans:
  - Oh that one there, in the corner.

- que:
  - The one up on the third floor?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What does this have to do with..?
  ans:
  - And you had a sister who died in the convent.

- que:
  - What business is it of yours..?
  ans:
  - Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.

- que:
  - I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
  ans:
  - Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.

- que:
  - You were a smoker?
  ans:
  - Two packs a day.

- que:
  - Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
  ans:
  - No-one.

- que:
  - How did she hide it from the other nuns?
  ans:
  - She undressed alone... she bathed alone.

- que:
  - Is that normal?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did she hide it during the day?
  ans:
  - She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.

- que:
  - Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
  ans:
  - We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.

- que:
  - Who was the father?
  ans:
  - I haven't a clue.

- que:
  - What man had access to her?
  ans:
  - None as far as I know.

- que:
  - Was there a priest?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I...

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.

- que:
  - Could there have been anyone else?
  ans:
  - Obviously there was.

- que:
  - And you didn't try to find out who?
  ans:
  - Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.

- que:
  - She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
  ans:
  - Look, someone gave her the baby.

- que:
  - Why do you think that?
  ans:
  - Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.

- que:
  - What's your opinion?
  ans:
  - I believe Agnes is different.

- que:
  - How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
  ans:
  - Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.

- que:
  - If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
  ans:
  - So, someone else could have done it.

- que:
  - And in your eyes?
  ans:
  - I've already told you what I thought.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.

- que:
  - When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
  ans:
  - Shortly after she came to us.

- que:
  - And you weren't shocked?
  ans:
  - I was appalled, just as you are now.

- que:
  - And what happened?
  ans:
  - She stopped eating completely...

- que:
  - This was before her pregnancy?
  ans:
  - About two years before.

- que:
  - Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
  ans:
  - It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...

- que:
  - I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
  ans:
  - It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nuns... you hate nuns.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Aquittal.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.

- que:
  - When would Agnes have conceived the child?
  ans:
  - Oh, some time in January.

- que:
  - Earthquakes?
  ans:
  - Visitors to the convent.

- que:
  - Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Was the child full term?
  ans:
  - Oh, Dear God...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The sheets...

- que:
  - What sheets?
  ans:
  - Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...

- que:
  - When was that?
  ans:
  - The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.

- que:
  - Sister Paul?
  ans:
  - Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.

- que:
  - Like keeping her home from school?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Listening to angels?
  ans:
  - She drank too much. That's what killed her.

- que:
  - Do you know what she did to her?
  ans:
  - I don't think I care to know.

- que:
  - Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
  ans:
  - Because I didn't know...

- que:
  - And my permission?
  ans:
  - I'd like yours too.

- que:
  - Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
  ans:
  - Because I am a moral person.

- que:
  - What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
  ans:
  - Nothing...

- que:
  - Stupid woman... and that's all?
  ans:
  - That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.

- que:
  - So you left the Church because you had freckles?
  ans:
  - No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.

- que:
  - My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you?
  ans:
  - No, it reminds me.

- que:
  - Would you like one? Huh?
  ans:
  - I'd love one.

- que:
  - All right?
  ans:
  - Fine thanks...

- que:
  - Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
  ans:
  - Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...

- que:
  - Right...
  ans:
  - Saint Peter?

- que:
  - Mary Magdelen?
  ans:
  - Oh, you've come a long way baby.

- que:
  - Right. What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
  ans:
  - There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.

- que:
  - Do you think they ever existed?
  ans:
  - Yes I do.

- que:
  - Do you want to become one?
  ans:
  - Become? One is born a saint.

- que:
  - Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
  ans:
  - Listen to her singing.

- que:
  - Would it stop you if I did?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - May I be present?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - You're what?
  ans:
  - If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.

- que:
  - For the Church?
  ans:
  - For Agnes.

- que:
  - You think she's a saint?
  ans:
  - My God, you're as crazy as...

- que:
  - How ?
  ans:
  - This is insane.

- que:
  - But how did it happen?
  ans:
  - You'll never find the answer for everything God did.

- que:
  - I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
  ans:
  - But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.

- que:
  - That's what you believe she is? The sum of her psychological parts?
  ans:
  - That's what I have to believe...

- que:
  - That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
  ans:
  - Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.

- que:
  - Who was that person Mother? Was it you?
  ans:
  - If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.

- que:
  - Hasn't she had enough?
  ans:
  - I have a few more questions to ask her.

- que:
  - Who knew she was pregnant?
  ans:
  - Why do you insist upon pressing...

- que:
  - Did you know she was pregnant?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - For what? An abortion?
  ans:
  - Oh, don't be ridiculous.

- que:
  - Too late for what?
  ans:
  - I don't know... too late to stop it.

- que:
  - The baby?
  ans:
  - The scandal...

- que:
  - Before or after you killed the child?
  ans:
  - I left it with her and I went for help.

- que:
  - Agnes, what happened to the baby?
  ans:
  - She can't remember.

- que:
  - Of course, John.
  ans:
  - What happened to the baby?

- que:
  - Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
  ans:
  - How fascinating. Do go on ... ... John.

- que:
  - Eh?
  ans:
  - Lay them down.

- que:
  - They are?
  ans:
  - The cards... you're bank.

- que:
  - Well! A boy of your age bowling \"hoop\" at people. How old are you anyway?
  ans:
  - Nine.

- que:
  - Y'what?
  ans:
  - You heard, it gets on my wick.

- que:
  - Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
  ans:
  - I'm a deserter.

- que:
  - Are you now?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I've blown school out.

- que:
  - Just you?
  ans:
  - No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.

- que:
  - Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.

- que:
  - Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Not much cop without 'em, is it?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's all right.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What they like?
  ans:
  - Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.

- que:
  - How about Ding Dong?
  ans:
  - He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.

- que:
  - Why aren't you at work?
  ans:
  - I'm a deserter, too.

- que:
  - Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
  ans:
  - What about all these letters?

- que:
  - Can you fix him for me?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
  ans:
  - Leave them drums alone.

- que:
  - Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
  ans:
  - Well, that's the wrong line for a start.

- que:
  - Oh, yes, now I'm with you.  But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
  ans:
  - Sorry?

- que:
  - Ah ... a shamus, eh?
  ans:
  - I see you go to the night court.

- que:
  - Are you going in?
  ans:
  - No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.

- que:
  - Me? Why?
  ans:
  - Bag-snatcher.

- que:
  - Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
  ans:
  - No. I don't.

- que:
  - Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it. Can he read?
  ans:
  - Of course I can.

- que:
  - I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
  ans:
  - I'll have a bash.

- que:
  - Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
  ans:
  - Ta.

- que:
  - Grotty?
  ans:
  - Yeah, grotesque.

- que:
  - And who's this Susan when she's at home?
  ans:
  - Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - She's a trend setter. It's her profession!

- que:
  - A butcher?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she was fickle.

- que:
  - Did you look in here?
  ans:
  - He's sulking again.

- que:
  - Is he?
  ans:
  - Come on, Auntie, you're winning.

- que:
  - Should I say it?
  ans:
  - Follow your impulse.

- que:
  - How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
  ans:
  - You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.

- que:
  - What are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - Come here.

- que:
  - Morning! Who's that little old man?
  ans:
  - It's Paul's grandfather.

- que:
  - Oh, sorry I spoke.
  ans:
  - Well, what happened?

- que:
  - I've got you worried, haven't I?
  ans:
  - I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.

- que:
  - How'd you guess?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's the way you talk.

- que:
  - Are you pulling my leg?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Thank you.
  ans:
  - Gear?

- que:
  - Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
  ans:
  - I'm not ...

- que:
  - Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
  ans:
  - No. I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.

- que:
  - Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - Well, the way you were spouting, like .... \"I don't believe you, sir...\" and all that. Yeah, it was gear.

- que:
  - The big hammer?
  ans:
  - Oh aye, a sledge.

- que:
  - Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
  ans:
  - They ought to be.

- que:
  - What are you?
  ans:
  - I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.

- que:
  - Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
  ans:
  - What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.

- que:
  - Why selfish?
  ans:
  - Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.

- que:
  - And you honestly think that's what she meant?
  ans:
  - Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.

- que:
  - And what do you do about it?
  ans:
  - You can learn from books.

- que:
  - So you are a man after all.
  ans:
  - Out where?

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - Oh ... I dunno.

- que:
  - Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
  ans:
  - And what's it all come to in the end?

- que:
  - Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - You're only right.

- que:
  - Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
  ans:
  - Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.

- que:
  - Have they?
  ans:
  - Me!

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Lip reading.

- que:
  - What are they saying?
  ans:
  - Nothing good.

- que:
  - Is there a fire, then?
  ans:
  - You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.

- que:
  - Eh?
  ans:
  - I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.

- que:
  - What's he on about?
  ans:
  - I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.

- que:
  - Would you two like a cup of tea?
  ans:
  - You see, sly villains.

- que:
  - And we're looking after him, are we?
  ans:
  - I'll look after meself.

- que:
  - Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
  ans:
  - It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.

- que:
  - A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
  ans:
  - Oh, well that's all right. What?

- que:
  - Why do you always use your left hand?
  ans:
  - Well, don't be daft, I've got to.

- que:
  - Anything to spare?
  ans:
  - We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.

- que:
  - And another thing, where's that old mixer?
  ans:
  - Here, Pauly.

- que:
  - Clean though, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, he's clean all right.

- que:
  - Is that yours?
  ans:
  - For Ringo.

- que:
  - Well, what are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.

- que:
  - What are you doing there?
  ans:
  - Hiding.

- que:
  - What little old man?
  ans:
  - That little old man.

- que:
  - How d'you reckon that one out?
  ans:
  - Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.

- que:
  - Well we know that but what's he doing here?
  ans:
  - Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.

- que:
  - Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.

- que:
  - Shall I?
  ans:
  - I hope he fell off.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Well, I've got me gob stopper. Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.

- que:
  - You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
  ans:
  - Eh, don't take out me lines.

- que:
  - What's he know?
  ans:
  - Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.

- que:
  - What's old got to do with it?
  ans:
  - You needn't bother.

- que:
  - Y'what?
  ans:
  - If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.

- que:
  - Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
  ans:
  - Of course, he's concealed about me person.

- que:
  - Please, can I have one to surge with?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well, yes your nose is. Very.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - I would have said so.

- que:
  - What have you heard?
  ans:
  - It's all over the place, everyone knows.

- que:
  - Is it? Is it really?
  ans:
  - Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.

- que:
  - Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
  ans:
  - It'll only get you into trouble.

- que:
  - That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Since you ask, yes. Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.

- que:
  - Have you lost him?
  ans:
  - Don't exaggerate.

- que:
  - Eh, where's my grandfather?
  ans:
  - Don't start. Look.

- que:
  - None for me, then?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - What do you think are you're up to?
  ans:
  - Someone put it on me.

- que:
  - Do I have to raise me voice?
  ans:
  - Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Paul's grandfather.

- que:
  - Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
  ans:
  - Down the ... er ...

- que:
  - Oh, down the ... er ...?
  ans:
  - Yeah, down the ... er ...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nerves.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.

- que:
  - Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
  ans:
  - Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.

- que:
  - Eh, what's all this?
  ans:
  - Oh, him... He's been lurking.

- que:
  - Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
  ans:
  - I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.

- que:
  - Oh, a little savage, is he?
  ans:
  - A proper Aborigine.

- que:
  - Is that you, Roby?
  ans:
  - I feel like shit...

- que:
  - Are you in pain?
  ans:
  - Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.

- que:
  - Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
  ans:
  - ... I don't know...

- que:
  - Where's Irth?
  ans:
  - Sandy, scan the whole sky.

- que:
  - Where the hell are we?
  ans:
  - Just short of Zeta II Reticuli. We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.

- que:
  - Can you get it a little closer?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm going to do.

- que:
  - Any rotation?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Two hours.

- que:
  - Gravity?
  ans:
  - Point eight six. We can walk on it.

- que:
  - Is it solid?
  ans:
  - Receiving.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I'm on my way.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Take a look.

- que:
  - You want to try?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Can we come up?
  ans:
  - No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.

- que:
  - Can you see anything in the hole?
  ans:
  - Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.

- que:
  - Are you okay in there?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm okay. Haven't hit bottom yet. Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.

- que:
  - What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but this is hard work. Can't talk now.

- que:
  - Don't you remember?
  ans:
  - Don't remember nothing. Can't hardly remember my name.

- que:
  - I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
  ans:
  - I think that's a pretty reasonable request.

- que:
  - Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.

- que:
  - A transmission?
  ans:
  - A voice transmission.

- que:
  - Computer, what language was that?
  ans:
  - Unknown.

- que:
  - Just hold it! Computer, have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
  ans:
  - I have interrupted the course of the voyage.

- que:
  - What? Why?
  ans:
  - I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.

- que:
  - Unknown! What do you mean?
  ans:
  - The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt. Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.

- que:
  - How long to fix?
  ans:
  - He died.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Not they...

- que:
  - Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

- que:
  - Yes? What is it?
  ans:
  - Jay, we've got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.

- que:
  - Why, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.

- que:
  - You like this shit?
  ans:
  - It grows on you.

- que:
  - You know what they make this stuff out of?
  ans:
  - Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It's food now. You're eating it.

- que:
  - Where's it coming from?
  ans:
  - Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.

- que:
  - What happened to the lights?
  ans:
  - Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.

- que:
  - Where does that go?
  ans:
  - All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.

- que:
  - What happened? Where's Sandy?
  ans:
  - Dead.

- que:
  - What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.

- que:
  - Hurt! How?
  ans:
  - Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.

- que:
  - What was that? What the Christ was that?
  ans:
  - And then we run out of food and oxygen.

- que:
  - Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
  ans:
  - Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...

- que:
  - And when will you be ready to do that?
  ans:
  - Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

- que:
  - Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The engines are fixed.

- que:
  - So does anybody have any suggestions?
  ans:
  - We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship. That would kill it.

- que:
  - Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
  ans:
  - Meet us on the bridge. Be careful -- it's huge now.

- que:
  - Where did it come from?
  ans:
  - He's the only one that knows that.

- que:
  - How does he breathe?
  ans:
  - Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.

- que:
  - Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
  ans:
  - It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.

- que:
  - That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
  ans:
  - It wouldn't come.

- que:
  - Hey now, what is this?
  ans:
  - Ask him.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It's dead.

- que:
  - How's Broussard?
  ans:
  - He's running a fever.

- que:
  - Still unconscious?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can you do anything for him?
  ans:
  - The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong.

- que:
  - How do we locate the creature?
  ans:
  - Maybe we don't have to. It's trapped in there. We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.

- que:
  - Got a better idea?
  ans:
  - We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there.

- que:
  - I don't buy that. There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
  ans:
  - Does anybody know what happened?

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - It's time for drastic remedies.

- que:
  - Should we go outside and bring him in?
  ans:
  - I've completely lost their signal.

- que:
  - Can you get them back?
  ans:
  - I'm trying.

- que:
  - What? What was that?
  ans:
  - The computer just translated the goddamn message. It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.

- que:
  - What do you mean, no?
  ans:
  - We're not going anywhere.

- que:
  - What's happening up here?
  ans:
  - I think it's fizzled out.

- que:
  - Hey! what about the film?
  ans:
  - That must have been when he got it.

- que:
  - You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
  ans:
  - It was horrible -- horrible. Like a chicken.

- que:
  - Recognizable! In that?
  ans:
  - In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.

- que:
  - Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard. Is that what you mean?
  ans:
  - And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.

- que:
  - Blow the ship up?
  ans:
  - And the creature with it. We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.

- que:
  - Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
  ans:
  - Isn't \"bait\" the word you used?

- que:
  - Is it armed?
  ans:
  - If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.

- que:
  - Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
  ans:
  - Feast your eyes.

- que:
  - Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
  ans:
  - I've got it. It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

- que:
  - Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness. How long till dawn?
  ans:
  - Well... this rock rotates every two hours. The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.

- que:
  - Just settle down. Sandy, you get any response yet?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds. I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.

- que:
  - All right. Now just remember, keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise. Martin, do you read me?
  ans:
  - That way.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - My signal's fading.

- que:
  - How far?
  ans:
  - We should be almost on top of it. I just can't quite...

- que:
  - Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
  ans:
  - That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - No, it's coming.

- que:
  - It won't come -- it's stuck.
  ans:
  - Can you see anything?

- que:
  - Let's let the machine work on him.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - It's stopped?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank heaven.

- que:
  - Is it still dripping?
  ans:
  - It appears to have healed itself.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Room by room, corridor by corridor.

- que:
  - And what do we do when we find it?
  ans:
  - We'll have to trap it somehow. If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.

- que:
  - That's the one about the albatross, right?
  ans:
  - We came out there, we'll go back. A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.

- que:
  - Are they close?
  ans:
  - They're on the next level up.

- que:
  - All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
  ans:
  - Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe. This is an opportunity which may never come again.

- que:
  - These day and night cycles are totally disorienting. I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
  ans:
  - About four hours.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.

- que:
  - Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
  ans:
  - First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.

- que:
  - What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
  ans:
  - Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.

- que:
  - Where are we?
  ans:
  - Sandy, contact traffic control.

- que:
  - Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?
  ans:
  - Oh my God.

- que:
  - Engine room, what happened?
  ans:
  - Yeah, okay.

- que:
  - Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
  ans:
  - 10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.

- que:
  - Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
  ans:
  - Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.

- que:
  - Good! Moisture content?
  ans:
  - Zero. Dry as a bone.

- que:
  - Any microorganisms?
  ans:
  - Not a one. It's dead.

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - Yeah, rock particles. Dust.

- que:
  - Found what?
  ans:
  - It appears to be some sort of spacecraft. We're going to approach it.

- que:
  - Martin?
  ans:
  - I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.

- que:
  - Find anything we missed?
  ans:
  - I don't even know what I'm looking for.

- que:
  - Still worried?
  ans:
  - Oh well... you know me.

- que:
  - What would you say that was supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...

- que:
  - But why draw it on the wall?
  ans:
  - This ship is full of cat hair.

- que:
  - Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
  ans:
  - It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him. Let us in.

- que:
  - What film?
  ans:
  - Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he? We can see what happened to him.

- que:
  - Is that its mouth?
  ans:
  - They seem native to the planet. It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity. It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - I guess we open the door and net it.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - What do you think? Now we go in.

- que:
  - Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.

- que:
  - So the only question left is, who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
  ans:
  - Let's be democratic.

- que:
  - How did it get so big?
  ans:
  - By eating our food supplies.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Can you make out any pattern in all that?
  ans:
  - Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.

- que:
  - Can we get to him?
  ans:
  - No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.

- que:
  - So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
  ans:
  - Now. If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.

- que:
  - Who gets the privilege?
  ans:
  - All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.

- que:
  - What did it do to you?
  ans:
  - Look...

- que:
  - What can I do?
  ans:
  - Kill me...

- que:
  - Headache? Dehydration?
  ans:
  - The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.

- que:
  - Can I... um... have some water? Please?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.

- que:
  - Better?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Do you wanna head back and call it in?
  ans:
  - Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.

- que:
  - Is it dead?
  ans:
  - No, it's still breathing. Kinda clammy though. Are you sure your stick's not broken.

- que:
  - Looks like a spore. Fungus of some kind, maybe?
  ans:
  - Bloody big if it is. Top's open.

- que:
  - Good argument for gun-control. What are you going after, rhino?
  ans:
  - We've got no option. We're gonna have to get it off.

- que:
  - Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
  ans:
  - Okay, give me the numbers.

- que:
  - What do you need?
  ans:
  - Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.

- que:
  - How many of them are there?
  ans:
  - Too many.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Comin' up the Central Reservoir.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - Drains right into the Central Reservoir.

- que:
  - Shit. When?
  ans:
  - Yesterday. We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash since twenty-four.

- que:
  - I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
  ans:
  - No, but I got something that might interest you.

- que:
  - Where're they headed?
  ans:
  - We ran a trajectory simulation. If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.

- que:
  - Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
  ans:
  - The door's sealed from inside. Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.

- que:
  - What's our weapons situation?
  ans:
  - Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.

- que:
  - Has anybody talked to them?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - How much air-time have I got?
  ans:
  - About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.

- que:
  - Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Hey! I was in shape before we started doing this.

- que:
  - Listen to what?
  ans:
  - That's what I mean. This is the quietest I've ever heard it. It's unnatural.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.

- que:
  - Something spooking the rhinos?
  ans:
  - I dunno.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Take a look at this.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Just got a reading...

- que:
  - What? Are you nuts? Just the two of us?
  ans:
  - I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - Hey, fair enough. If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'll come with you.

- que:
  - Still got him?
  ans:
  - It's moving slow. About... eleven metres. On the left.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I'm picking up another signal.

- que:
  - What? Where?
  ans:
  - Just behind us, over to the right.

- que:
  - Can't see a thing. Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I...

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Might be a glitch.

- que:
  - Is it still moving?
  ans:
  - No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - York just turned up outside. We're trying to get him into Infirmary.

- que:
  - Where does that lead to?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - That sounds promising. Can we operate the crane from here?
  ans:
  - Which mean physically going outside.

- que:
  - Is this the suit?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - How tight are these shafts?
  ans:
  - Hey, Jan. See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.

- que:
  - What's the problem?
  ans:
  - She was running a little sluggish on the way back. Think the turbines might be playing up.

- que:
  - And...?
  ans:
  - And, nothing. They checked out just fine.

- que:
  - Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
  ans:
  - Done it already. Nothing matches.

- que:
  - Fort Powell. What do we tell 'em?
  ans:
  - Just give them the facts. They can leap to their own conclusions.

- que:
  - How many... how many people are missing?
  ans:
  - They knocked out the external feeds.

- que:
  - What? Why?
  ans:
  - There's still time to back-out.

- que:
  - Forget it. I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself. Where's the disk?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while. Clear my head.
  ans:
  - Right. Auto-shop, you all set?

- que:
  - Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
  ans:
  - I've got a lot of thinking to do. 'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.

- que:
  - Not too much of the socializing type, then?
  ans:
  - No, not really. More sort of the 'claustrophobic' type.

- que:
  - How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months?
  ans:
  - Four.

- que:
  - And before that?
  ans:
  - Six month stint on Datus.

- que:
  - What is this? 'Twenty Questions'?
  ans:
  - Just curious. There's a lot of talk goes around.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Real man' drink.

- que:
  - Any luck raising Ackland's party?
  ans:
  - First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.

- que:
  - We'? You wanna fly out there with me?
  ans:
  - Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.

- que:
  - Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
  ans:
  - There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Think I spoke too soon...

- que:
  - They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here. I don't...remember what happened next.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What can I do?
  ans:
  - Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range. They're making their own way back tomorrow.

- que:
  - How's it going?
  ans:
  - Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.

- que:
  - What time's sundown?
  ans:
  - Bout five minutes.

- que:
  - Hello, there. Who are you?
  ans:
  - Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...

- que:
  - How do you know my name?
  ans:
  - It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.

- que:
  - And what is your name?
  ans:
  - Phoebe.

- que:
  - Phoebe?
  ans:
  - I call myself Phoebe.

- que:
  - May I come in?
  ans:
  - Certainly, Mr. deWitt...

- que:
  - We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
  ans:
  - Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.

- que:
  - I'm not enough for a paragraph.
  ans:
  - I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?

- que:
  - San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
  ans:
  - Yes. I do.

- que:
  - And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
  ans:
  - Yes. The Shubert.

- que:
  - Eddie what?
  ans:
  - I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...

- que:
  - Hungry?
  ans:
  - Just some coffee.

- que:
  - She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
  ans:
  - Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.

- que:
  - Just like that, eh?
  ans:
  - Just like that.

- que:
  - Aren't you?
  ans:
  - Frankly - yes.

- que:
  - All paved with diamonds and gold?
  ans:
  - You know me better than that.

- que:
  - Paved with what, then?
  ans:
  - Stars.

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - Almost four.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - The mark of a true killer. Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...

- que:
  - Why'd call me a killer?
  ans:
  - Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.

- que:
  - Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
  ans:
  - Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.

- que:
  - We're?
  ans:
  - Lloyd and I.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...

- que:
  - I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
  ans:
  - We decided the night before last, before we came up here...

- que:
  - Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
  ans:
  - I don't know what I take you for anything...

- que:
  - What have you got to do with it?
  ans:
  - Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.

- que:
  - No-no-no...
  ans:
  - What of it?

- que:
  - And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
  ans:
  - Yes, Addison.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I don't want to.

- que:
  - It's the same thing, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Exactly. Here. Take it to the party instead of me.

- que:
  - Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
  ans:
  - Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.

- que:
  - Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
  ans:
  - You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.

- que:
  - Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
  ans:
  - That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.

- que:
  - What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
  ans:
  - This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.

- que:
  - You were there? At the play - last night?
  ans:
  - A happy coincidence.

- que:
  - From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
  ans:
  - Margo.

- que:
  - Margo? Lunching in public?
  ans:
  - It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.

- que:
  - Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
  ans:
  - I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?

- que:
  - The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
  ans:
  - Being violently ill to her tummy.

- que:
  - Didn't you know?
  ans:
  - Of course I knew.

- que:
  - How... how was Miss Caswell?
  ans:
  - Frankly, I don't remember.

- que:
  - Was she that bad?
  ans:
  - I take it she read well.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Right here. A minute ago.

- que:
  - We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
  ans:
  - I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...

- que:
  - When? When are you going to do it?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten- - and you're going to be on time.

- que:
  - Nothing?
  ans:
  - Everything... everything's so funny...

- que:
  - Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
  ans:
  - Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?

- que:
  - Where's my coat?
  ans:
  - I told her. I sounded off.

- que:
  - you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
  ans:
  - Huh?

- que:
  - And cut that out right now.
  ans:
  - How childish are you going to get before you quit it?

- que:
  - Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
  ans:
  - That I am...

- que:
  - in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
  ans:
  - When - when are you coming back?

- que:
  - You in a hurry?
  ans:
  - A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...

- que:
  - Sing it?
  ans:
  - Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...

- que:
  - And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
  ans:
  - Happy birthday, darling...

- que:
  - Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
  ans:
  - It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...

- que:
  - She did...?
  ans:
  - Yeah... I will.

- que:
  - How is Eve? Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night- - aren't we, honey?
  ans:
  - I had no idea you were even here.

- que:
  - Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
  ans:
  - You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.

- que:
  - Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
  ans:
  - If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.

- que:
  - What's all over?
  ans:
  - The audition.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The kid. Junior.

- que:
  - You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I'm trying terribly hard.

- que:
  - Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
  ans:
  - It's not nonsense.

- que:
  - But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me? Isn't that enough?
  ans:
  - I wish it were.

- que:
  - Then what would be enough? If we were married?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.

- que:
  - Bill... ... where are you going? To find Eve?
  ans:
  - That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.

- que:
  - What would you like? Texas?
  ans:
  - You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.

- que:
  - You know what I'm going to be?
  ans:
  - A cowboy.

- que:
  - Hello, what's your name?
  ans:
  - Eve. Eve Harrington.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I just wondered.

- que:
  - Just wondered what?
  ans:
  - Why.

- que:
  - Why what?
  ans:
  - Why you have to go out there.

- que:
  - Is it the money?
  ans:
  - Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.

- que:
  - I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Are you proud of me, Bill?
  ans:
  - I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.

- que:
  - Is that what you want me to be?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about you. And what you want.

- que:
  - What have I got to do with it?
  ans:
  - Everything.

- que:
  - You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
  ans:
  - I'm for it.

- que:
  - I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
  ans:
  - You hear all kinds of things.

- que:
  - The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
  ans:
  - But she just got here...

- que:
  - What did you expect - live sables?
  ans:
  - A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...

- que:
  - Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
  ans:
  - The same size?

- que:
  - Kill the people. Got your key?
  ans:
  - I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.

- que:
  - Do you want an argument or an answer?
  ans:
  - An answer.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Now you want an argument.

- que:
  - She thinks only for me... ... doesn't she?
  ans:
  - Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...

- que:
  - You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
  ans:
  - The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- Voila.

- que:
  - Late for what?
  ans:
  - Don't be dense. The party.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Miss Harrington...

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - You were just looking around...

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - You probably won't believe me.

- que:
  - What report? To whom?
  ans:
  - I've heard of them.

- que:
  - Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.

- que:
  - How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
  ans:
  - Subway.

- que:
  - How long does it take?
  ans:
  - With changing and everything, a little over an hour.

- que:
  - To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
  ans:
  - Why should you think I wouldn't be?

- que:
  - You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
  ans:
  - Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.

- que:
  - He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. I see the play.

- que:
  - You look just fine... ... by the way. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Eve. Eve Harrington.

- que:
  - Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
  ans:
  - It couldn't possibly interest you.

- que:
  - You're not going, are you?
  ans:
  - I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...

- que:
  - Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up... ... whose is it?
  ans:
  - Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.

- que:
  - Karen... ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
  ans:
  - Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?

- que:
  - Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
  ans:
  - ... you want to be Margo's new understudy.

- que:
  - Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
  ans:
  - I think she would cheer.

- que:
  - Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - You won't forget it?
  ans:
  - I won't forget.

- que:
  - I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
  ans:
  - You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...

- que:
  - Karen... ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
  ans:
  - No, Eve, I won't forget...

- que:
  - May I have your coat?
  ans:
  - No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.

- que:
  - If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
  ans:
  - Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?

- que:
  - After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
  ans:
  - It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.

- que:
  - Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
  ans:
  - I'd like anything Miss Channing played...

- que:
  - How'd hear about it?
  ans:
  - There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.

- que:
  - Did you see it here in New York?
  ans:
  - No, don't go...

- que:
  - You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
  ans:
  - What - again?

- que:
  - Well, you've done so much... what's new?
  ans:
  - The curtains. I made them myself.

- que:
  - No trouble at all.
  ans:
  - They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

- que:
  - Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
  ans:
  - Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.

- que:
  - I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
  ans:
  - Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too \"Seventeenish\" for me...

- que:
  - That's my job. See you at tea time...
  ans:
  - Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?

- que:
  - Of course.
  ans:
  - Eve... ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?

- que:
  - The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
  ans:
  - Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.

- que:
  - Really, Eve? Why?
  ans:
  - Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...

- que:
  - Ain't it the truth?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...

- que:
  - You've what?
  ans:
  - She's just outside the door.

- que:
  - Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
  ans:
  - Harrington.

- que:
  - I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
  ans:
  - Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...

- que:
  - How much time have we?
  ans:
  - Roughly ten minutes.

- que:
  - How far to the station?
  ans:
  - Three or four miles...

- que:
  - Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
  ans:
  - None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...

- que:
  - Do you want it on?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter.

- que:
  - What about Bill?
  ans:
  - He's in love with you.

- que:
  - Why should he - and why should you?
  ans:
  - Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.

- que:
  - I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
  ans:
  - Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...

- que:
  - Well... all right.
  ans:
  - About what?

- que:
  - With tears?
  ans:
  - With tears.

- que:
  - How was the concert?
  ans:
  - Loud.

- que:
  - Coming?
  ans:
  - In a minute...

- que:
  - Margo hasn't done badly by it.
  ans:
  - Lloyd, what happened...?

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

- que:
  - Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
  ans:
  - What time is it?

- que:
  - But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday! Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
  ans:
  - Eve.

- que:
  - Eve?
  ans:
  - She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...

- que:
  - Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
  ans:
  - You've got to admit it would be a novelty.

- que:
  - Such as?
  ans:
  - You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.

- que:
  - What are you going to wear?
  ans:
  - After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...

- que:
  - well? What happened?
  ans:
  - Nothing much. She apologized.

- que:
  - You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
  ans:
  - Not much.

- que:
  - What's so funny?
  ans:
  - Nothing...

- que:
  - I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
  ans:
  - Who is it? What's it all about?

- que:
  - How about calling it a night?
  ans:
  - And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...

- que:
  - What is he talking about?
  ans:
  - There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Up in the room.

- que:
  - Who's left out there?
  ans:
  - Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.

- que:
  - You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.

- que:
  - How's the new one coming?
  ans:
  - The play? All right, I guess...

- que:
  - \"Cora.\" She's - still a girl of twenty?
  ans:
  - Twentyish. It isn't important.

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - Don't be evasive.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - That's beside the point.

- que:
  - What's your being married got to do with it?
  ans:
  - Hello..

- que:
  - We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
  ans:
  - Call, what call?

- que:
  - I placed...?
  ans:
  - I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.

- que:
  - Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
  ans:
  - Poor Max. Heartburn? It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.

- que:
  - Miss Caswell? What?
  ans:
  - An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...

- que:
  - When's the audition?
  ans:
  - A couple of weeks.

- que:
  - Would you?
  ans:
  - Anything to help you out, Max.

- que:
  - You get quick action, don't you?
  ans:
  - Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...

- que:
  - What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
  ans:
  - Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Fuck you, Carl.

- que:
  - Forget it, the main thing-- --did you call me a failure?
  ans:
  - I was sure trying.

- que:
  - Hey?
  ans:
  - Hmm.

- que:
  - What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
  ans:
  - It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.

- que:
  - That was fun. What now?
  ans:
  - And?--And?--

- que:
  - Who's first?
  ans:
  - Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.

- que:
  - Facts or theory?
  ans:
  - Anything you've got.

- que:
  - Republican?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - 68.

- que:
  - Did he just say what I think he said?
  ans:
  - You voted for him.

- que:
  - How do you want to handle Sloan?
  ans:
  - You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one? Whichever.

- que:
  - Think Sloan's back? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am. I never like it when the other guy's human...

- que:
  - --Haldeman I know, who else?
  ans:
  - You asking would I have been one of the President's men? I would have been.

- que:
  - You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
  ans:
  - Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. God knows it worked.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Haldeman.

- que:
  - What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
  ans:
  - Well, we are trying to ruin his life.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Only everything...

- que:
  - So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
  ans:
  - You overslept?

- que:
  - --what time is it?
  ans:
  - 11,30.

- que:
  - Morning or night?
  ans:
  - Night.

- que:
  - Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I'm on deadline.

- que:
  - You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
  ans:
  - Whatever.

- que:
  - I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was. Think it might be anything?
  ans:
  - Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.

- que:
  - I told you, he had to go out on a case.
  ans:
  - Any idea what he did?

- que:
  - Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
  ans:
  - He is not in the car. Sorry.

- que:
  - Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Mind if I try?
  ans:
  - According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.

- que:
  - Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
  ans:
  - They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.

- que:
  - By \"they\" you mean...?
  ans:
  - By \"they\" you mean the White House, don't you? Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.

- que:
  - Do you feel much about the things you did?
  ans:
  - I didn't do anything wrong.

- que:
  - Chapin did contact you then?
  ans:
  - Sure--off the record.

- que:
  - On the orders of Haldeman?
  ans:
  - Can't help you.

- que:
  - --so?
  ans:
  - I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.

- que:
  - What's a real denial?
  ans:
  - If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- --it's time to start circling the wagons.

- que:
  - --if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
  ans:
  - I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- --you think I like being aced out?

- que:
  - --what about you?--
  ans:
  - --Bernstein, are you sure on this story?

- que:
  - Oh, they're here. I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah. See?
  ans:
  - Hey... very tense.

- que:
  - You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
  ans:
  - I think.

- que:
  - If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
  ans:
  - I don't know what they'd do to me.

- que:
  - All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
  ans:
  - I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.

- que:
  - Which people?
  ans:
  - The ones who could disburse the money.

- que:
  - Who were they?
  ans:
  - There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.

- que:
  - It's awfully hot-- --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
  ans:
  - Sloan knew which five, didn't he?

- que:
  - Gordon Liddy, you mean?
  ans:
  - Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.

- que:
  - Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
  ans:
  - Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore-- --I think the place is bugged.

- que:
  - What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - No games, Irwin; give.

- que:
  - My big civil rights buddy-- --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming. What're you onto?
  ans:
  - Something maybe big.

- que:
  - And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
  ans:
  - Just tell me about the goddamn article.

- que:
  - Who by?
  ans:
  - A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.

- que:
  - --they're worse. That's why I quit.
  ans:
  - Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?

- que:
  - Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
  ans:
  - That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.

- que:
  - Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
  ans:
  - We were never told flat out \"Don't talk.\" But the message was clear.

- que:
  - To cover up?
  ans:
  - Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.

- que:
  - But they both worked at the White House?
  ans:
  - I will not talk about the other two.

- que:
  - What happens when the baby comes?
  ans:
  - I really can't talk now--

- que:
  - Then it's our asses, isn't it?
  ans:
  - My non-denial denial.

- que:
  - You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
  ans:
  - I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.

- que:
  - You asking me to disclose my source?
  ans:
  - Just tell me his title.

- que:
  - --I saw him. He verifies.
  ans:
  - Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?

- que:
  - We can't talk inside either?
  ans:
  - Electronic surveillance.

- que:
  - Anything else from Mr. Throat?
  ans:
  - Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--

- que:
  - Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
  ans:
  - There is no reason to assume other people were involved.

- que:
  - Are you implying you don't believe me?
  ans:
  - I have nothing more to say.

- que:
  - She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
  ans:
  - That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.

- que:
  - --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
  ans:
  - Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing, where did your talk with Berger happen?

- que:
  - ...you're definitely doing a story...?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
  ans:
  - That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.

- que:
  - I saw the flag signal--what's up?
  ans:
  - Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.

- que:
  - Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in. You come up with anything?
  ans:
  - Follow the money. Always follow the money.

- que:
  - To where?
  ans:
  - Go on.

- que:
  - --melodramatic? Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
  ans:
  - You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?

- que:
  - What's the whole thing about--do you know?
  ans:
  - What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.

- que:
  - My turn to keep you waiting. What's the topic for tonight?
  ans:
  - Ratfucking.

- que:
  - Who?--be specific. How high up?
  ans:
  - You'll have to find that out, won't you.

- que:
  - Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
  ans:
  - They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.

- que:
  - Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
  ans:
  - Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.

- que:
  - Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
  ans:
  - Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.

- que:
  - Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
  ans:
  - I was being cautious. You can safely say more then fifty...

- que:
  - Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and... Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? He is?
  ans:
  - Howard Hunt here.

- que:
  - And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
  ans:
  - Security consultant.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Government. Recently retired.

- que:
  - Where in government?
  ans:
  - ...Central... Intelligence... Agency...

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - The C.I.A.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
  ans:
  - It may never come out.

- que:
  - And the underground garage one. Would I know him?
  ans:
  - I couldn't say.

- que:
  - Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
  ans:
  - Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.

- que:
  - As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
  ans:
  - You can't believe that.

- que:
  - I can't sell hints to Simons-- --you called everyone you know? Call someone you don't know.
  ans:
  - What'd you get on W.House?

- que:
  - Who's Colson, Harry?
  ans:
  - The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.

- que:
  - He just did.
  ans:
  - You think she wants us to ease up on the story?

- que:
  - The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
  ans:
  - No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.

- que:
  - And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
  ans:
  - When so ordered.

- que:
  - Haldeman. Right?
  ans:
  - I won't talk about the other two.

- que:
  - One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
  ans:
  - Go on.

- que:
  - A boy or a girl?
  ans:
  - A girl. Melissa.

- que:
  - No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
  ans:
  - --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?

- que:
  - LADY The what to what?
  ans:
  - You work there, Miss Abbott.

- que:
  - What the hell was that?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Okay then. The rest of you okay with that?
  ans:
  - Good work, Ostreicher.

- que:
  - Great evening, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Suck me...beautiful?
  ans:
  - Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Alright, well...you've got to tone it down. You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.

- que:
  - Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
  ans:
  - I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance. When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.

- que:
  - You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
  ans:
  - Mochaccino. Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.

- que:
  - When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
  ans:
  - Ah, Stifler's mom! Thank you for letting us have a great party.

- que:
  - I'm so happy for you. Takes the edge off, doesn't it? And where might your date be?
  ans:
  - Oh no, no date. Bathroom incident.

- que:
  - ...Nevermind. You have anything to drink?
  ans:
  - I believe the kegs are upstairs.

- que:
  - Single malt?
  ans:
  - Aged eighteen years. Why don't you get the glasses. Behind the bar.

- que:
  - Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Of course, Finch. What?
  ans:
  - Whatever you hear about me, you agree.

- que:
  - What are we gonna hear?
  ans:
  - You'll see. Gotta go. Sixteen minute round trip.

- que:
  - What do you suppose they're saying?
  ans:
  - No idea.

- que:
  - So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
  ans:
  - Not bad, Chris.

- que:
  - Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.

- que:
  - Okay. I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
  ans:
  - I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested.

- que:
  - You can call me Oz.
  ans:
  - Hey, what're you doing here?

- que:
  - Do I have to?
  ans:
  - You can call me Ostreicher.

- que:
  - What's your middle name?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - You don't like it?
  ans:
  - No, I like the car. By the way, though, about prom? That was like a bad idea. Sorry I invited you.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - Because I want to.

- que:
  - How did you know I was here?
  ans:
  - Stifler told me.

- que:
  - You talked to Stifler?
  ans:
  - Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song.

- que:
  - Well, State's got a good business school. And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers?
  ans:
  - Yeah. So wow, you've got it figured out.

- que:
  - I know. Salt and pepper?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - So we're gonna be close next year?
  ans:
  - You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.

- que:
  - Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex. So did you do the physics write-up?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
  ans:
  - I think I've had one.

- que:
  - Well that's a no. No wonder you're not psyched about sex. You've never even had one manually?
  ans:
  - ...I've never tried it.

- que:
  - Jessica, can you drive me home?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You mean...and orgasm?
  ans:
  - You got it, stud.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Do you love her?
  ans:
  - I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.

- que:
  - Did you guys hook up or something?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? No.

- que:
  - Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
  ans:
  - Oooh, yeah. Oh, baby, you're so good.

- que:
  - There's our man.
  ans:
  - You think she was serious?

- que:
  - Finch, you got the Latin homework?
  ans:
  - Unlisted age, plus \"youthful mind,\" equals old.

- que:
  - You can crash at Stifler's?
  ans:
  - It's all good. Breath check.

- que:
  - So, does my hair look better -- like this, or... like this?
  ans:
  - What about you? You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.

- que:
  - You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
  ans:
  - Sorry, I thought you were dead.

- que:
  - Like a bet?
  ans:
  - No, a pact. No money involved. This is more important than any bet. Now here's the deal, We all get laid before we graduate.

- que:
  - Hey, where's Finch?
  ans:
  - Went home to shit.

- que:
  - I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
  ans:
  - You can send me the address too.

- que:
  - Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
  ans:
  - I'll save you a seat.

- que:
  - But, but -- what would I do?
  ans:
  - Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.

- que:
  - Come on, Jim. Where are you?
  ans:
  - Please, God. Let this be it.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - She's already on a plane back home.

- que:
  - No, no that's fine. So you doing okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Can I come in?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - You're not...busy?
  ans:
  - Yes dad.

- que:
  - Dad, please stop. Please. I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
  ans:
  - Jim?

- que:
  - Hold on. You have no idea why I'm angry?
  ans:
  - Michelle.

- que:
  - Really? You seriously want to go with me?
  ans:
  - Yes. Seriously.

- que:
  - You know, at band camp? We have dances like this. Only they're way funner. Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
  ans:
  - Highly, highly overrated.

- que:
  - A hot cartoon.
  ans:
  - So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?

- que:
  - No -- Kevin, you?
  ans:
  - Ooh, here's an easy one, \"Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion.\" Okay...\"Attractive\"...ugly.

- que:
  - This was remade? Into what?
  ans:
  - Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...

- que:
  - Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- Cool Hip Jim... or Laid Back Jim?
  ans:
  - Shortstop. 'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.

- que:
  - So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
  ans:
  - Feels like warm apple pie, dude.

- que:
  - Apple pie... McDonald's or homemade?
  ans:
  - Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.

- que:
  - Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.

- que:
  - You can do that?
  ans:
  - Oh -- no way. I can't do that to her.

- que:
  - You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
  ans:
  - No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net. I don't think they liked it.

- que:
  - After getting laid?
  ans:
  - After high school.

- que:
  - What's up, fellas?
  ans:
  - Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes.

- que:
  - Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
  ans:
  - You did it.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yes. No. Yes.

- que:
  - Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place?
  ans:
  - I suppose that would be okay.

- que:
  - So you need to change, right?
  ans:
  - Do you mind? This fabric is so uncomfortable.

- que:
  - Strip?
  ans:
  - Yes, slowly.

- que:
  - For me?
  ans:
  - Uh...

- que:
  - Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
  ans:
  - It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.

- que:
  - Oh, Kev.
  ans:
  - You think so?

- que:
  - Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
  ans:
  - Let me know.

- que:
  - Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
  ans:
  - How?

- que:
  - Like how?
  ans:
  - Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.

- que:
  - Kevin? Do you not love me?
  ans:
  - No, I don't not love you. I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us. Something good. Something special.

- que:
  - I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
  ans:
  - It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.

- que:
  - Yeah, are you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah. Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Okay. Did you bring a condom?
  ans:
  - Yeah, right here.

- que:
  - I don't know. How do you?
  ans:
  - Like, normal style. The...missionary position.

- que:
  - Yeah Vick?
  ans:
  - I want to hear you say it.

- que:
  - You called me to ask me how to get laid?
  ans:
  - What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number.

- que:
  - What? Not the Bible?
  ans:
  - Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.

- que:
  - Does it tell me how to get laid?
  ans:
  - You know what, nevermind. You're not ready.

- que:
  - Ready for what?
  ans:
  - Whoop, you're fading out. Good luck at that party.

- que:
  - Say that again, Kevin?
  ans:
  - Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something. To make her, you know...

- que:
  - Uh -- forget that. Look, is that all you're interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
  ans:
  - That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify.

- que:
  - Qualify for what?
  ans:
  - You've just inherited The Bible.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Once, in church, dude.

- que:
  - How the hell do you know all these random songs?
  ans:
  - It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake.

- que:
  - Feeling better, Oz?
  ans:
  - I'm such a loser.

- que:
  - No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
  ans:
  - Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.

- que:
  - So does your tongue cramp up?
  ans:
  - Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

- que:
  - What reputation?
  ans:
  - Observe.

- que:
  - ...Guess what?
  ans:
  - I don't care.

- que:
  - He didn't?
  ans:
  - I guess we'll call you two-ply.

- que:
  - Wow. You two really have something going, don't you?
  ans:
  - Depends if my date wants to stop by.

- que:
  - That junior chick?
  ans:
  - She works part-time at my dad's store.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you doing here?
  ans:
  - This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot.

- que:
  - You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
  ans:
  - Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me.

- que:
  - I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
  ans:
  - Oh my fucking God. You're gay.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - You know. If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.

- que:
  - Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
  ans:
  - Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.

- que:
  - Would you shut up?
  ans:
  - Tell you what, we'll jump together.

- que:
  - Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Apparently.

- que:
  - Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
  ans:
  - A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.

- que:
  - Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
  ans:
  - Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...

- que:
  - Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
  ans:
  - Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.

- que:
  - Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
  ans:
  - Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.

- que:
  - Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...

- que:
  - Like an underground club?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.

- que:
  - And who's Claude?
  ans:
  - Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.

- que:
  - What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
  ans:
  - Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...

- que:
  - What happened? Did you cut yourself?
  ans:
  - Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.

- que:
  - Fan-fucking-tastic?
  ans:
  - Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.

- que:
  - What about your glasses?
  ans:
  - It's okay. I can see fine.

- que:
  - So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
  ans:
  - Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...

- que:
  - Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
  ans:
  - Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...

- que:
  - Where did you go last night? What did you do?
  ans:
  - I don't... I... I can't remember...

- que:
  - What?! He told you? When?
  ans:
  - You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.

- que:
  - A cure?
  ans:
  - Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...

- que:
  - What makes you so sure this will work?
  ans:
  - I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.

- que:
  - Are you crazy!?
  ans:
  - Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.

- que:
  - What the fuck!? You too!?
  ans:
  - I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...

- que:
  - Andy?... What? What is it? Andy... are you okay?
  ans:
  - Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.

- que:
  - We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
  ans:
  - What...?

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's making me hungry.

- que:
  - It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
  ans:
  - What does it say?

- que:
  - You on drugs? Huh?
  ans:
  - No... I...

- que:
  - Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
  ans:
  - And you call me a moron...

- que:
  - Ha. Some wonder drug...
  ans:
  - If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?

- que:
  - Looks like he lied to you too.
  ans:
  - Why isn't it doing anything!?

- que:
  - Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
  ans:
  - But... I don't remember anything, I swear...

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that. But that would be illegal...

- que:
  - Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
  ans:
  - Andy...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.

- que:
  - Why the fuck would I do that?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...

- que:
  - Claude.
  ans:
  - Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?

- que:
  - Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
  ans:
  - That's McDermott, but yeah.

- que:
  - Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
  ans:
  - Jesus...

- que:
  - How well did, er, do you know him?
  ans:
  - No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.

- que:
  - Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma?
  ans:
  - Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.

- que:
  - I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
  ans:
  - Not that I know.

- que:
  - Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
  ans:
  - Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...

- que:
  - What've you got?
  ans:
  - Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:
  - Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Okay. So maybe you were right.

- que:
  - I was showing Sonya something ...
  ans:
  - You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?

- que:
  - What were you showing her?
  ans:
  - How to read.

- que:
  - Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
  ans:
  - No. I'm running to.

- que:
  - Where is your home, Anya?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure but look...

- que:
  - I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Who's Sophie?
  ans:
  - We're just going to refresh your memory...

- que:
  - Did I tell you that?
  ans:
  - I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution...

- que:
  - Why do you want to go to Paris?
  ans:
  - I have my reasons.

- que:
  - Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
  ans:
  - Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.

- que:
  - Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....

- que:
  - Who are you, child?
  ans:
  - I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...

- que:
  - Do you remember this?
  ans:
  - PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER

- que:
  - Don't you, child?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...

- que:
  - Dmitri didn't want the money?
  ans:
  - No, he just wanted to know you were happy.

- que:
  - Why does everyone have to act that way?
  ans:
  - I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...

- que:
  - No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
  ans:
  - And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?

- que:
  - Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
  ans:
  - Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...

- que:
  - We will. We have to. Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
  ans:
  - Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?

- que:
  - It's her.
  ans:
  - What was that?

- que:
  - Hurry up with those papers.
  ans:
  - He's her?

- que:
  - Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
  ans:
  - Wake up, young lady, that's our train.

- que:
  - What do we do now?
  ans:
  - If I used the word \"bleak\" I would be optimistic.

- que:
  - The \"Odessa Dunk\"?
  ans:
  - It worked in Odessa...

- que:
  - Are you feeling all right?
  ans:
  - Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!

- que:
  - I should go
  ans:
  - Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.

- que:
  - Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
  ans:
  - Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.

- que:
  - Hey, you on television?
  ans:
  - No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - You don't want my autograph.

- que:
  - Who's on television?
  ans:
  - This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.

- que:
  - You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
  ans:
  - What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read \"Death in Venice\".

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.

- que:
  - What do you mean, next?
  ans:
  - Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.

- que:
  - Do you feel all right?
  ans:
  - Allison.

- que:
  - Yeah? Allison what?
  ans:
  - Portchnik.

- que:
  - Yeah, Earl Warren?
  ans:
  - Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

- que:
  - Lyndon Johnson?
  ans:
  - L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.

- que:
  - Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
  ans:
  - Tsch.

- que:
  - The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
  ans:
  - I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.

- que:
  - Okay. Please, I have a headache, all right?
  ans:
  - Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.

- que:
  - Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
  ans:
  - Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.

- que:
  - Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
  ans:
  - I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie? So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

  ans:
  - The alarm clock.

- que:
  - I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
  ans:
  - You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?

- que:
  - Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
  ans:
  - Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

- que:
  - What-what-what-what's the matter?
  ans:
  - I-you know, I don't wanna.

- que:
  - Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
  ans:
  - Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think- Aaaah! Okay.

  - So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
  ans:

  - That place is four hundred dollars a month?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
  ans:

- que:
  - Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

  ans:
  - Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.

  ans:
  - It's his name.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
  ans:
  - Oh, it was... really weird. But she's a very nice woman.

- que:

  ans:
  - Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.

- que:
  - Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
  ans:
  - M'hm.

  ans:
  - Yeah?

  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.

- que:
  - Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
  ans:
  - Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.

- que:
  - She said, \"Will it change my wife.\" You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
  ans:
  - Tsch, what'd the doctor say?

- que:
  - There's a spider in the bathroom.
  ans:
  - Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There's a big black spider in the bathroom.

- que:
  - That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
  ans:
  - My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.

- que:
  - Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
  ans:
  - Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.

- que:
  - I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
  ans:
  - Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

- que:
  - Yeah, where is the spider?
  ans:
  - It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.

- que:
  - Is he in the bathroom?
  ans:
  - Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.

- que:
  - Oh. What?
  ans:
  - Very big spider.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:

  ans:
  - It's for my complexion.

  - Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.

- que:
  - W-w-whatta you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.

- que:
  - Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
  ans:
  - Yeah?

- que:
  - Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
  ans:
  - You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.

- que:
  - Here's a real present.
  ans:
  - What is this? Is this a... Present? Are you kidding?

- que:
  - What... huh?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Max, I've got a hit series.

  ans:
  - She was stealing.

- que:
  - SO?
  ans:
  - So the colored have enough trouble.

  ans:
  - How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?

- que:
  - I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
  ans:
  - If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.

  - You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't know.

  - Uh, how did this personality come about?
  ans:
  - I was very charming.

  ans:
  - Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

  - How long have you worked for the Therrians?
  ans:
  - A long time.

  ans:
  - Ten, fifteen minutes ago.

- que:
  - Why didn't you come in?
  ans:
  - I hate the sight of blood. You guys don't take prisoners.

- que:
  - Anouk isn't like a dog, really. More like a small person. So is there anyone here for me? No one looks new. Who's that?
  ans:
  - You don't want that. It's married and it's the neighbor.

- que:
  - Oh I think he's cute. How's the marriage part working out?
  ans:
  - You're fucking desperate.

- que:
  - Like you didn't know. Who invited the bimbo?
  ans:
  - One guess.

- que:
  - Jack. Did you compose that yourself?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Had a little help?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not.

- que:
  - The neighbors from hell. The kind that lay in wait. I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I? Wouldn't I?
  ans:
  - Can we... one at a time? Hold it down, and one at a time. You're last, Cal.

- que:
  - Why last?
  ans:
  - It's going. It's going.

- que:
  - Isn't Skye amazing?
  ans:
  - She's got great tits.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... The wisdom. She's an old soul. She knew that Shostakovich thing. Did you notice?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. And she's got great tits.

- que:
  - No, what?
  ans:
  - The movie.

- que:
  - Who, Sally?
  ans:
  - I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films. But those were all such great directors.

- que:
  - Any thoughts on casting yet?
  ans:
  - Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude passed.

- que:
  - Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?

  ans:
  - He's allergic.

- que:
  - Didn't I say?
  ans:
  - Well, probably.

- que:
  - Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed. And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.

- que:
  - You want a Tylenol, or something?
  ans:
  - I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.

- que:
  - Why would she care?
  ans:
  - You need to knock off the pills, Clair.

- que:
  - Don't you miss it?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - What is that thing?
  ans:
  - So this sitter can always reach me. I'm still not used to leaving him.

- que:
  - Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
  ans:
  - I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.

- que:
  - Would you leave us alone right now?
  ans:
  - I love her too, Joe.

- que:
  - That for us?
  ans:
  - What a nose. You missed your calling.

  - Please?
  ans:
  - Directing suits you.

  ans:
  - Oh, very jealous.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I love you, Joe Therrian.

  - Let's go upstairs, okay?
  ans:
  - The suspense is killing me.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:

  - And you know our friends, how?
  ans:

  - You have?
  ans:
  - Well it's fucking time.

- que:
  - Are you my big brave boy? Are you my brave hero?
  ans:
  - You're crazy baby. I love you.

- que:
  - Do you want me to save you? Do you want me to save you?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Let me heal you, baby.

- que:
  - Hm. Do you like fucking out of doors?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Man, I must really be stoned. Thanks, buddy.

  ans:
  - Ryan's novel.

- que:
  - Ryan's novel?
  ans:
  - No luck.

- que:
  - Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
  ans:
  - Happy anniversary, baby.

- que:
  - What did you get me?
  ans:
  - In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.

- que:
  - Through the sweats or not?
  ans:
  - Not.

- que:
  - No. Did you?
  ans:
  - No. I missed that.

- que:
  - I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we?
  ans:
  - We're great.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you. It was the only chance I had to meet her.

- que:
  - No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
  ans:
  - And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

- que:
  - Who'd like to go and find Otis?
  ans:
  - Yes.

  ans:
  - It's taken care of.

- que:
  - Truce?
  ans:
  - Truce.

- que:
  - Listen to yourself... Don't worry, it's alright. We'll find him. What's wrong with you?

  - Love?
  ans:
  - You walked out on a five year marriage.

- que:
  - And how hard it hit?
  ans:
  - Just stop right there, Sally. We've been through this.

  - Right. And when was the last time you spoke to her?
  ans:
  - It's a novel.

- que:
  - Hello? Last birthday was?
  ans:
  - I don't look my age, Joe.

- que:
  - Who? Who? Who thinks that?
  ans:
  - Your director and your co-star of your current movie. Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.

- que:
  - Cal, too?
  ans:
  - Sally, for Christ's sake.

- que:
  - Anyone else?
  ans:
  - This is insanity. Sally...

- que:
  - Alright, good. Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
  ans:
  - Everybody hates the messenger.

  - Sure.

  - No.

- que:
  - Don't I find what?
  ans:
  - You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you.

- que:
  - And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
  ans:
  - Mmm hmmm.

- que:
  - The infamous dog?
  ans:
  - He's the best dog in the world. They're both coming tonight. Not my idea.

- que:
  - You lose this?
  ans:
  - Ah there's our snookums now.

- que:
  - You got your DP?
  ans:
  - What? Oh yeah, the camera man? They gave me a list.

- que:
  - Not particularly. Weird, isn't it? God I'm rally up. Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
  ans:
  - Kind of. Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends. And great DP's I could give them a call for you.

- que:
  - God, I really need to jump about a bit. How's your film going?
  ans:
  - Well, you know...good days, bad days.

- que:
  - Right away. Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
  ans:
  - Your Eames table is incredible. And the B&B. I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.

- que:
  - Sally did all this herself?
  ans:
  - Mmm. It says something about the two of you maybe.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism...

- que:
  - Elitism?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny.

- que:
  - What am I, five?
  ans:
  - You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one.

- que:
  - Lemon or raspberry?
  ans:
  - Lemon.

- que:
  - And he doesn't smoke?
  ans:
  - He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.

- que:
  - How long have you been married?
  ans:
  - Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about.

- que:
  - Sorry?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing's sacred. No, nothing at all.

- que:
  - How do you do, Skye?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

- que:
  - How's he doing?
  ans:
  - Not good.

- que:
  - Do you want to go home, Ryan?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you making an ass of yourself?
  ans:
  - There's only you, Ryan. You know what, Ryan? You're beautiful. I love you so much... You need...

- que:
  - Ready to go?
  ans:
  - I'm going to go get my swimsuit. I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. Ryan, you're a great man.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - All the ugly phone calls? We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.

- que:
  - Sally?
  ans:
  - Yes. And you've met Joe.

- que:
  - Hors d'oeuvres or something?
  ans:
  - Yes, great! It's a beautiful house.

- que:
  - How long ago was it?
  ans:
  - Come on in.

- que:
  - Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
  ans:
  - No, never.

- que:
  - Is there space here?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you need anything else?
  ans:
  - No, no thanks.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - The charades.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - The Shostakovich.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.

- que:
  - Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Would you, like, marry him?
  ans:
  - If he were still alive, maybe.

- que:
  - Are you asking me to marry you?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.

- que:
  - Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
  ans:
  - Who told you that? No. I'm twenty... Five.

- que:
  - Are you lovesick?
  ans:
  - Suicidal. It's much less codependent.

- que:
  - Will champagne help?
  ans:
  - Not enough.

- que:
  - She's all over him, are you blind?
  ans:
  - It could be worse.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.

- que:
  - Like your business managers?
  ans:
  - They're not just our business managers, Panes.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - About five thousand dollars. With my discount.

- que:
  - Why don't you go fuck yourself?
  ans:
  - No. Really. For real. Really.

- que:
  - How's the movie going? Your movie. You are making a movie, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes. Fine.

- que:
  - That's it? Yes. Fine?
  ans:
  - I don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I never like to talk about my work.

- que:
  - Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
  ans:
  - You're my best friend.

- que:
  - That's not an answer, is it?
  ans:
  - Yes, you're a monster.

- que:
  - Panes?
  ans:
  - From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...

- que:
  - What did I do?
  ans:
  - Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like.

- que:
  - You're keeping a record, are you?
  ans:
  - It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.

- que:
  - Absolutely. You always wonder where your books end up. Why don't we use it?
  ans:
  - Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - You don't need to do that.

- que:
  - Like Joe.
  ans:
  - Oh my God! America told me your neighbors are coming?

- que:
  - Hmm. Where are my kids?
  ans:
  - In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them.

- que:
  - Isn't this a fabulous picture?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - So where should I put it?
  ans:
  - I thought it was okay where it was.

- que:
  - We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she?
  ans:
  - The both of you.

- que:
  - So how much do you hate her?
  ans:
  - Big time.

- que:
  - Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
  ans:
  - Oh Soph, Joe loves kids. Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.

- que:
  - Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
  ans:
  - You weren't exactly horrified.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.

- que:
  - This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing?
  ans:
  - Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig. We're not the ones in charge.

- que:
  - Hey, slow it down, big boy. You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
  ans:
  - I'm new...I was born yesterday.

- que:
  - Are you asking me out to dinner?
  ans:
  - No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.

- que:
  - You miss him? Why?
  ans:
  - Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.

- que:
  - And you are...?
  ans:
  - I'm Princess Bala.

- que:
  - Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure. So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Divinely?
  ans:
  - No weirdly...You remind me of someone...

- que:
  - He was a worker. I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
  ans:
  - No...as a matter of fact...

- que:
  - Stop fooling around in there.
  ans:
  - Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?

- que:
  - Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you?
  ans:
  - General Formica won't let me die out here. I'm his fiancee.

- que:
  - Look. How many other Princesses are there?
  ans:
  - Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no. About five thousand four hundred by now.

- que:
  - So what makes you so special?
  ans:
  - Well...I am the oldest.

- que:
  - Forget it. You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. \"Insectopia\".
  ans:
  - Yes?

- que:
  - So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
  ans:
  - Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.

- que:
  - Oh no...
  ans:
  - Why do they have you tied up here?

- que:
  - Z! what are you doing?
  ans:
  - I mean, I've got the whole package, right? A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.

- que:
  - A few?
  ans:
  - The Club's so stuffy. I want to try someplace different.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - Yes...he's wonderful...

- que:
  - Trial membership? Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
  ans:
  - Who is that idiot?

- que:
  - Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
  ans:
  - No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.

- que:
  - Princess! You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
  ans:
  - Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. We have thirty-six seconds available right now.

- que:
  - Outstanding. Princess...?
  ans:
  - No one should have to. Have him brought to me.

- que:
  - What do we have on this \"Insectopia\"?
  ans:
  - Scattered reports, sir. Rumors. Nothing reliable.

- que:
  - So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
  ans:
  - Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.

- que:
  - Thank you, sir.
  ans:
  - Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?

- que:
  - So tell me. Where's Z?
  ans:
  - I...I have no idea, sir.

- que:
  - Royal victory party? Will...will Princess Bala be there?
  ans:
  - Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.

- que:
  - Engaged? As in you're getting married?
  ans:
  - Affirmative.

- que:
  - So...you two are in love?
  ans:
  - Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.

- que:
  - Well I, I don't think \"living it up\" is the right term -- how about \"working themselves to death\"?
  ans:
  - Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting. Good luck with the hallucinations.

- que:
  - Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
  ans:
  - We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...

- que:
  - I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
  ans:
  - Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you.

- que:
  - Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
  ans:
  - Conversation...yes...well... Wasn't she briefed?

- que:
  - But General -- this tunnel is your baby! You're sure you can't stay ?
  ans:
  - Ask me why we're so successful.

- que:
  - What do you see out there?
  ans:
  - ...Ants...

- que:
  - We declared war again? Are you scared?
  ans:
  - I'll be back.

- que:
  - Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. Don't you want your aphid beer?
  ans:
  - I can't help it. I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy.

- que:
  - Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
  ans:
  - Of course. You were born two seconds after me.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know.
  ans:
  - Will you introduce me to some worker girls?

- que:
  - I'm getting lonely. Who are you talking to, anyway?
  ans:
  - My mother.

- que:
  - Yeah. How much?
  ans:
  - You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.

- que:
  - I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.

- que:
  - So this is your mother's apartment?
  ans:
  - That's right. Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE Hiya, Ouspenskaya.

- que:
  - Something the matter?
  ans:
  - I seem to have dropped my key. Oh -- here it is.

- que:
  - Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
  ans:
  - Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.

- que:
  - From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
  ans:
  - Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

- que:
  - Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
  ans:
  - You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?

- que:
  - One napkin, coming up. I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
  ans:
  - So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?

- que:
  - All right -- I'll tell him. Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
  ans:
  - What did I tell you?

- que:
  - Sheldrake?
  ans:
  - It's a bet.

- que:
  - It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
  ans:
  - I sort of like it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.

- que:
  - I hope everything goes all right.
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - I hope so. Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything -- How do I look?
  ans:
  - Fine. Wait.

- que:
  - Oh -- Miss Kubelik. I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
  ans:
  - I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.

- que:
  - Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Would you like to?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Oh. You mean -- like a girl-friend?
  ans:
  - No. Like a man.

- que:
  - This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
  ans:
  - It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.

- que:
  - What time does the show go on?
  ans:
  - Eight-thirty.

- que:
  - How is your cold?
  ans:
  - What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town -- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.

- que:
  - What gave you that idea?
  ans:
  - In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.

- que:
  - One more?
  ans:
  - I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.

- que:
  - By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order. Shall we join the natives?
  ans:
  - Why not? They seem friendly enough.

- que:
  - How many of those drinks did you have?
  ans:
  - Three.

- que:
  - You all right? What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing. There are just too many people here.

- que:
  - Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
  ans:
  - No -- I like it.

- que:
  - Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side -- is that better?
  ans:
  - Much better.

- que:
  - He and I are like this. Sent me a Christmas card. See?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.

- que:
  - I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
  ans:
  - What kind of talk is that? So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.

- que:
  - My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
  ans:
  - Two o'clock.

- que:
  - Here. How about some breakfast?
  ans:
  - No -- I don't want anything.

- que:
  - Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
  ans:
  - My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.

- que:
  - Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first. Just what are you going to tell her?
  ans:
  - Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.

- que:
  - You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
  ans:
  - I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Someone from the office.

- que:
  - And where are you now?
  ans:
  - In his apartment.

- que:
  - His apartment?
  ans:
  - I mean -- her apartment.

- que:
  - What's your friend's name?
  ans:
  - Baxter.

- que:
  - What's her first name?
  ans:
  - Miss.

- que:
  - When are you coming home?
  ans:
  - As soon as I can walk.

- que:
  - Something wrong with your legs?
  ans:
  - No -- it's my stomach.

- que:
  - Your stomach?
  ans:
  - They had to pump it out.

- que:
  - Yes, I've got it. Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
  ans:
  - Open it.

- que:
  - That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You want me to move the television set in here? You play gin rummy?
  ans:
  - I'm not very good at it.

- que:
  - Why do people have to love people, anyway?
  ans:
  - Yeah -- I know what you mean. Queen.

- que:
  - A bad insurance risk?
  ans:
  - That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

- que:
  - A cemetery?
  ans:
  - I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.

- que:
  - I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD How many guys were there?
  ans:
  - You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.

- que:
  - Was he really upset when you told him?
  ans:
  - Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.

- que:
  - You really think so?
  ans:
  - No doubt about it.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.

- que:
  - Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
  ans:
  - You are?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.

- que:
  - Do I have to?
  ans:
  - You bet. I got a terrific hand.

- que:
  - You sure you want to throw that card?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Would you mind opening the window?
  ans:
  - Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.

- que:
  - Who'd care?
  ans:
  - I would.

- que:
  - Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
  ans:
  - -- Mr. Sheldrake.

- que:
  - Gas. Didn't you turn it on?
  ans:
  - Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.

- que:
  - Are you supposed to?
  ans:
  - In this house, you're supposed to.

- que:
  - What are you doing with that?
  ans:
  - I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.

- que:
  - Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner. I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN Why not?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.

- que:
  - Over a girl?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - That's terrible.
  ans:
  - In the knee?

- que:
  - Of course not. Here's the fruit cake. And you want to see my knee?
  ans:
  - No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.

- que:
  - Are we dressing for dinner?
  ans:
  - No -- just come as you are.

- que:
  - Shall I light the candles?
  ans:
  - It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.

- que:
  - You usually eat alone?
  ans:
  - Cheers.

- que:
  - I don't?
  ans:
  - We're going to finish that gin game.

- que:
  - Fine. How's your eye?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
  ans:
  - You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.

- que:
  - Oh.
  ans:
  - Yes. You walking to the subway?

- que:
  - Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
  ans:
  - No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Are you sure? How's your knee?
  ans:
  - I'm fine all over.

- que:
  - Mind if I come in?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - That's funny -- so am I. What did you do with the cards?
  ans:
  - In there.

- que:
  - What about Mr. Sheldrake?
  ans:
  - I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.

- que:
  - Some weather we're having. Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral. You locked out of your apartment?
  ans:
  - No, no. Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.

- que:
  - All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.

- que:
  - Baxter?
  ans:
  - And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.

- que:
  - Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - The Vice Squad?
  ans:
  - That's right, Baxter.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.

- que:
  - You better.
  ans:
  - Are you going to deny it?

- que:
  - I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
  ans:
  - How would you like to go tonight?

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - Now put down the key -- -- and put down the address.

- que:
  - Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
  ans:
  - Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

- que:
  - Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
  ans:
  - Morning, gentlemen. Everything satisfactory? You like your office?

- que:
  - I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

- que:
  - To me?
  ans:
  - I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.

- que:
  - And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
  ans:
  - Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.

- que:
  - You're going to take her off my hands?
  ans:
  - That's right. I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.

- que:
  - Now what was your news, Baxter?
  ans:
  - It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.

- que:
  - Mine?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Yes, sir.
  ans:
  - Oh?

- que:
  - I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
  ans:
  - Very clever.

- que:
  - What do you mean, sorry?
  ans:
  - You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.

- que:
  - No key!
  ans:
  - I dig.

- que:
  - Now you're being bright?
  ans:
  - Thank you, sir.

- que:
  - What's gotten into you, Baxter?
  ans:
  - Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.

- que:
  - How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
  ans:
  - Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.

- que:
  - Fran been sick or something?
  ans:
  - No, no -- just had a little accident.

- que:
  - What does he mean, accident?
  ans:
  - On account of me.

- que:
  - Who else?
  ans:
  - Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.

- que:
  - Mr. Sheldrake?
  ans:
  - Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.

- que:
  - Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you busy these days?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. They are indeed.

- que:
  - A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice. What is she trying to prove?
  ans:
  - Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - What do I -- ? Just a minute.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
  ans:
  - Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.

- que:
  - Hiya, Buddy-boy. I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
  ans:
  - Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?

- que:
  - Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
  ans:
  - Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
  ans:
  - Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice. Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.

- que:
  - Of course not. But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
  ans:
  - It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.

- que:
  - Make it thirty minutes. What do you say, Bud?
  ans:
  - I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.

- que:
  - Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
  ans:
  - I have a vague idea.

- que:
  - You threatening me?
  ans:
  - Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.

- que:
  - Hi, Doc. Had a late call?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.

- que:
  - When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
  ans:
  - My body? I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

- que:
  - What are you going to do, Doc?
  ans:
  - Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.

- que:
  - You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
  ans:
  - Want to tell me what happened?

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - Miss Kubelik -- Fran.

- que:
  - Any of that coffee left?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How do you spell her last name?
  ans:
  - Kubelik -- with two k's.

- que:
  - Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
  ans:
  - Help yourself.

- que:
  - How's the patient?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm fine, Doc.

- que:
  - What's this -- you packing?
  ans:
  - Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

- que:
  - Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor. By the way, whatever happened to her?
  ans:
  - You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.

- que:
  - You like Castro? I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
  ans:
  - You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.

- que:
  - What about him?
  ans:
  - Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.

- que:
  - Who is Mickey?
  ans:
  - My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.

- que:
  - Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
  ans:
  - Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.

- que:
  - Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville! You married?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Family?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where do we go -- my place or yours?
  ans:
  - Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.

- que:
  - Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana -- -- want to see his picture?
  ans:
  - Not particularly.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a personal question?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You got a girl-friend?
  ans:
  - She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.

- que:
  - Good night?
  ans:
  - The party's over.

- que:
  - What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
  ans:
  - It's an emergency -- see you some other time.

- que:
  - Nothing. Just clear out, will you?
  ans:
  - Kubelik.

- que:
  - A.W.O.L.?
  ans:
  - What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.

- que:
  - I see. What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
  ans:
  - Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.

- que:
  - Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
  ans:
  - That guy really must've belted him.

- que:
  - Tell me again -- what's my name?
  ans:
  - Dr. Dreyfuss.

- que:
  - And what happened to you?
  ans:
  - I took sleeping pills.

- que:
  - Do you know where you are, Fran?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
  ans:
  - This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.

- que:
  - Why did you take sleeping pills?
  ans:
  - You fool -- you damn fool.

- que:
  - Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
  ans:
  - Well -- thank you.

- que:
  - Still afraid somebody may see us together?
  ans:
  - Let me take that.

- que:
  - No, Jeff. I can't stay very long. Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
  ans:
  - It's on the way. I see you went ahead and cut your hair.

- que:
  - Six weeks. But who's counting?
  ans:
  - I want you back, Fran.

- que:
  - Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
  ans:
  - No. I have a date at eight-thirty.

- que:
  - Important?
  ans:
  - Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.

- que:
  - Remember what we talked about?
  ans:
  - We talked about a lot of things.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.

- que:
  - You'll miss your train, Jeff.
  ans:
  - Are you sure that's what you want?

- que:
  - Coming?
  ans:
  - Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.

- que:
  - All set for what?
  ans:
  - I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.

- que:
  - Atlantic City?
  ans:
  - I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.

- que:
  - Baxter?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.

- que:
  - What guy? Whose apartment is this, anyway?
  ans:
  - I told you -- with my mother.

- que:
  - Where does she live?
  ans:
  - A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.

- que:
  - You mean you bring other girls up here?
  ans:
  - Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

- que:
  - Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
  ans:
  - Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.

- que:
  - What gives?
  ans:
  - A little mixup in signals. Let's go.

- que:
  - What's your mother doing this afternoon?
  ans:
  - She's home -- stuffing a turkey.

- que:
  - Did you have a nice Christmas?
  ans:
  - Lovely. You were a big help.

- que:
  - Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
  ans:
  - It's a thought.

- que:
  - Where are you headed?
  ans:
  - What's it matter? Get to the point.

- que:
  - Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
  ans:
  - We need all our fuel anyway.

- que:
  - Moonby what?
  ans:
  - Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

- que:
  - How about a drink ?
  ans:
  - Sure, thanks.

- que:
  - Which part is that ?
  ans:
  - My part. Beer, with ice and water.

- que:
  - Delta ?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - North ?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Way north.

- que:
  - What unit were you with ?
  ans:
  - None.

- que:
  - Rangers, eh?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - Tracks ?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
  ans:
  - Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

- que:
  - How long were you up there ?
  ans:
  - A long time.

- que:
  - Who are you ?
  ans:
  - It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.

- que:
  - So what happened ?
  ans:
  - Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

- que:
  - What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
  ans:
  - Arch light.

- que:
  - What are you doing out here?
  ans:
  - Cook school -- that did it.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How much is left?
  ans:
  - Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.

- que:
  - And the grass?
  ans:
  - Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.

- que:
  - Charlie?
  ans:
  - Looks that way.

- que:
  - Who's he?
  ans:
  - God knows.

- que:
  - What are we doing here?
  ans:
  - Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.

- que:
  - You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.

- que:
  - We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
  ans:
  - Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.

- que:
  - Where ?
  ans:
  - We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.

- que:
  - Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.

- que:
  - What the hell is it?
  ans:
  - In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.

- que:
  - When'd you do it?
  ans:
  - While you were sleeping.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Listen.

- que:
  - Will they attack?
  ans:
  - If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.

- que:
  - Which way? Right or left?
  ans:
  - Who knows? Right.

- que:
  - Anybody see some smoke ?
  ans:
  - Too far inland.

- que:
  - What cat ?
  ans:
  - One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.

- que:
  - Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
  ans:
  - They nail him for it bad ?

- que:
  - I wonder if that was the same copter.
  ans:
  - Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?

- que:
  - What do you want ?
  ans:
  - If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.

- que:
  - Whose orders ?
  ans:
  - I only met Kurtz once.

- que:
  - Would he remember you ?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What does that mean ?
  ans:
  - Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.

- que:
  - Our Recon flight ?
  ans:
  - Ours.

- que:
  - Terminate ?
  ans:
  - Terminate with extreme prejudice.

- que:
  - Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it still runs.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.

- que:
  - Charlie?
  ans:
  - No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.

- que:
  - Charlie?
  ans:
  - NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.

- que:
  - How did they know?
  ans:
  - They must have seen the fire.

- que:
  - This gentleman or myself ?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
  ans:
  - I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.

- que:
  - You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
  ans:
  - I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.

- que:
  - A lame ?
  ans:
  - This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.

- que:
  - About what ?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.

- que:
  - But why ?
  ans:
  - He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.

- que:
  - American weapons?
  ans:
  - We took them from the dead. Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.

- que:
  - Captain?
  ans:
  - You'll get blown outta here some day.

- que:
  - Do you know that jungle?
  ans:
  - When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.

- que:
  - What about an American named Kurtz?
  ans:
  - Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.

- que:
  - What's your name, sailor ?
  ans:
  - Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.

- que:
  - Lance Johnson? The surfer?
  ans:
  - That's right, sir.

- que:
  - Where've you been riding, Lance?
  ans:
  - I haven't surfed since I got here.

- que:
  - What, sir?
  ans:
  - I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.

- que:
  - You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
  ans:
  - I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.

- que:
  - Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
  ans:
  - They far enough?

- que:
  - Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
  ans:
  - Boss left.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.

- que:
  - How big it is?
  ans:
  - Six to eight feet.

- que:
  - Wh -- what?
  ans:
  - Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.

- que:
  - You want'a surf, soldier?
  ans:
  - Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.

- que:
  - Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
  ans:
  - I got bored in Saigon.

- que:
  - What's the furthest you been in?
  ans:
  - Haiphong.

- que:
  - Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
  ans:
  - No. Walked.

- que:
  - What'd you do for supplies?
  ans:
  - Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.

- que:
  - Can you trust them?
  ans:
  - Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

- que:
  - Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
  ans:
  - Who knows.

- que:
  - Don't you agree?
  ans:
  - He musta changed ! I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.

- que:
  - Hairy ?
  ans:
  - I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.

- que:
  - What about this point here?
  ans:
  - We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.

- que:
  - Music?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.

- que:
  - Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
  ans:
  - Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.

- que:
  - You were not coming here, to see me?
  ans:
  - No -- no, sir.

- que:
  - What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
  ans:
  - You know you're right.

- que:
  - Do you know me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I like it...

- que:
  - How's yours?
  ans:
  - I can handle it.

- que:
  - What Truth?
  ans:
  - Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Going back - to the jungle to die.

- que:
  - Did you know him very well?
  ans:
  - You get to know each other pretty well out there.

- que:
  - Maybe he'll get tubed.
  ans:
  - And you admired him?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Just something I read in the Free Press.

- que:
  - Are you finished surfing?
  ans:
  - Yeah... thanks.

- que:
  - Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - Which one's the Colonel's?
  ans:
  - The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.

- que:
  - He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
  ans:
  - This one , Lance?

- que:
  - You hear it again?
  ans:
  - No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Any time -- us -- Americans.

- que:
  - Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What's this tiger shit?
  ans:
  - No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.

- que:
  - You think?
  ans:
  - Bring your rifles, that's all. Take us to him.

- que:
  - Captain Willard?
  ans:
  - That's me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.

- que:
  - What is this bridge?
  ans:
  - It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

- que:
  - Why did they attack us?
  ans:
  - Simple. They don't want him to go.

- que:
  - You're Australian?
  ans:
  - Sounds like he's gone crazy.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - His name is...

- que:
  - May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
  ans:
  - We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.

- que:
  - Cognac?
  ans:
  - I should be checking on the boat.

- que:
  - Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
  ans:
  - No. Not really.

- que:
  - What will you do after the war?
  ans:
  - I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.

- que:
  - What's a big question?
  ans:
  - Kurtz. I know you've heard of him.

- que:
  - What did you hear?
  ans:
  - That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.

- que:
  - What things?
  ans:
  - Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.

- que:
  - Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
  ans:
  - I know.

- que:
  - Are you warm, Captain?
  ans:
  - The river is beautiful.

- que:
  - Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
  ans:
  - Right now -- I am.

- que:
  - Well who the hell verifies that ?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - That's 27, sir.
  ans:
  - What show ?

- que:
  - Son of a bitch, sir.
  ans:
  - Anyone got a card?

- que:
  - Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
  ans:
  - CONTINUED

- que:
  - How long have you been up north?
  ans:
  - Six months.

- que:
  - Had?
  ans:
  - She's dead.

- que:
  - -- Corbett's a killer.
  ans:
  - How did she..?

- que:
  - What happened here?
  ans:
  - The radio's on the fritz.

- que:
  - Where'd you say Eric is?
  ans:
  - It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - He still might be around. I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.

- que:
  - Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - Did you catch Corbett?
  ans:
  - Sure did. He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.

- que:
  - Was there any trouble?
  ans:
  - I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.

- que:
  - Be careful, okay?
  ans:
  - That's my line.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you everything later.

- que:
  - Where's Corbett?
  ans:
  - Here. A transport plane is due at eleven. Once I put him on it, it's all over.

- que:
  - So what's the problem?
  ans:
  - Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.

- que:
  - Ben Corbett?
  ans:
  - Yep. Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.

- que:
  - No big deal. We just got off on the wrong foot. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Desmond.

- que:
  - New to the country, kid?
  ans:
  - Six months. Ecological study for Northland Oil.

- que:
  - Does he have people?
  ans:
  - A daughter in Oregon.

- que:
  - How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
  ans:
  - Smart? Sure. That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.

- que:
  - Been driving long?
  ans:
  - Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.

- que:
  - Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
  ans:
  - I don't plan on dying.

- que:
  - Most dangerous thing in the world, A regular Joe, in over his head. You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
  ans:
  - It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.

- que:
  - You know Meyerling?
  ans:
  - Sure. The People's Friend. Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yep. Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.

- que:
  - You don't get it, do you?
  ans:
  - What?! Fuck off. Save yourself.

- que:
  - You don't feel cold?
  ans:
  - It's a spring day...

- que:
  - Where's my ELT?
  ans:
  - Emergency transmitter? All your gear is back at Wilder's.

- que:
  - You got one?
  ans:
  - I'm sure she's fine. Seemed like a clever kid.

- que:
  - Emergency transmitter? What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
  ans:
  - Answer and I'll shoot!

- que:
  - Can you walk?
  ans:
  - Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.

- que:
  - How come you didn't let him shoot me?
  ans:
  - Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.

- que:
  - Hullo, Sam. Slow day?
  ans:
  - Ben...boys. Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.

- que:
  - Relax. One more day without drink won't kill you. Right, Sam?
  ans:
  - I'm living proof of that sad fact.

- que:
  - Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
  ans:
  - No, I better stay at my post.

- que:
  - All this for laying traps on private land?
  ans:
  - Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth. I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.

- que:
  - Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
  ans:
  - Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man. Other guy drew first.

- que:
  - -- Forget it. And try not to bleed on my throw rugs. Why do this?
  ans:
  - If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.

- que:
  - Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
  ans:
  - Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.

- que:
  - Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - Corbett ruined my two-way. Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.

- que:
  - Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
  ans:
  - What's wrong?

- que:
  - Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
  ans:
  - There'll be three, four men at the most. I have some backup, nothing will happen.

- que:
  - I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
  ans:
  - Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.

- que:
  - What'd you say they call these spaceships?
  ans:
  - Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.

- que:
  - Any idea who could've done it?
  ans:
  - ...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.

- que:
  - Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
  ans:
  - I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.

- que:
  - Why the smirk?
  ans:
  - You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.

- que:
  - LeMalle. We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
  ans:
  - Goddamn! Viking Bob! Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...

- que:
  - You hear me? Ben?
  ans:
  - Ease off. We do this my way.

- que:
  - Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter. We know where they're going. C'mon.

- que:
  - Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail. You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
  ans:
  - We were just talking about him.

- que:
  - I didn't know you had a secret admire.
  ans:
  - Where's the kid?

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - You met the gift.

- que:
  - Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
  ans:
  - It lets a crazy man into our lives.

- que:
  - I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
  ans:
  - C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.

- que:
  - I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - What is it you want? What?
  ans:
  - I want us to go out.

- que:
  - How was it talking to him?
  ans:
  - Well, maybe he has nice friends.

- que:
  - Don't be silly. How bad?
  ans:
  - Not bad.

- que:
  - Hi... Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't. So why are you h...

- que:
  - Do you love me?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Not your name... what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
  ans:
  - He's in the bathroom... He's fine.

- que:
  - How long has he been having problems?
  ans:
  - Since forever.

- que:
  - Have they done blood tests on him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Have they done skin testing for allergies?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
  ans:
  - No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.

- que:
  - Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
  ans:
  - Me. My home number is on this card.

- que:
  - Water... Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Will you please take it?
  ans:
  - I know. He's just the best.

- que:
  - You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
  ans:
  - We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.

- que:
  - What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours... afraid it isn't clean?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - His name?
  ans:
  - Spencer.

- que:
  - So what are you doing with a dog?
  ans:
  - Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.

- que:
  - You're not worried that someone might take him?
  ans:
  - Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Oh, please...

- que:
  - And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age... how old are you?
  ans:
  - Otherwise, you're not ugly.

- que:
  - What's with the dark?
  ans:
  - Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...

- que:
  - You all set here?
  ans:
  - I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...

- que:
  - Sorry, honey... I'll be right there.
  ans:
  - My son is sick, okay?

- que:
  - Carol the waitress?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I was working... can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
  ans:
  - That's not why I'm here... ... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...

- que:
  - Why did yo do this for me?
  ans:
  - To get you back at work so you can wait on me.

- que:
  - What needs clearing up?
  ans:
  - I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.

- que:
  - Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
  ans:
  - Just how grateful I am.

- que:
  - So you'll be at work?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - A thank-you note for what you did for me.

- que:
  - So. Anything else?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

- que:
  - Hey, what I did for you is working out?
  ans:
  - What you did changed my life.

- que:
  - Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, \"what?\" I thought I said, \"what?\"... What?
  ans:
  - I want you to go on this trip.

- que:
  - The stiff one eye?
  ans:
  - Two days.

- que:
  - What's that got to do with it?
  ans:
  - Funny, I thought it was a strong point.

- que:
  - Is there another way to see it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you still coming?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
  ans:
  - Whether crabs are in season there now...

- que:
  - Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
  ans:
  - I was going to do that for you.

- que:
  - It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
  ans:
  - I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.

- que:
  - No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
  ans:
  - Yes... sure. I'll take the sofa.

- que:
  - Dancing?
  ans:
  - Stop asking everyone.

- que:
  - You wanna dance?
  ans:
  - I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.

- que:
  - Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries?
  ans:
  - Fries.

- que:
  - Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - Sex with Simon?
  ans:
  - It's one idea...

- que:
  - Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her?
  ans:
  - To hell with sex.

- que:
  - I'll take you... why not?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - How you doing?
  ans:
  - I can trust my brain.

- que:
  - Okay to say something now?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.

- que:
  - Grouchy?
  ans:
  - ... Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.

- que:
  - What a break...
  ans:
  - What job?

- que:
  - Is it a secret what you're doing here?
  ans:
  - I had to see you...

- que:
  - Boyfriend?
  ans:
  - Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.

- que:
  - Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
  ans:
  - Yes. I really would.

- que:
  - I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
  ans:
  - No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.

- que:
  - Was this supposed to be your room?
  ans:
  - Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.

- que:
  - Uh-huh...
  ans:
  - Can you not be violent?

- que:
  - Why? What have you been thinking about?
  ans:
  - How to die, mostly.

- que:
  - I just love her. How're you doing?
  ans:
  - But what about...

- que:
  - What the heck are those for?
  ans:
  - No. No. Get Carol.

- que:
  - There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
  ans:
  - What are you trying to do to me?

- que:
  - I also regrew my beard... but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you... when it comes to people you...
  ans:
  - You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?

- que:
  - He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Won't worry about it. You go ahead.

- que:
  - So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
  ans:
  - Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.

- que:
  - How's Verdell doing?
  ans:
  - He's a pain in the ass.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - \"What?\" Look at you... You sense a mark.

- que:
  - Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
  ans:
  - Think white and get serious.

- que:
  - Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
  ans:
  - Like the wind but I'm not doing it.

- que:
  - Hi. You have hard shells, right?
  ans:
  - Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.

- que:
  - Shall I get her for you?
  ans:
  - No, it's all right. I'll just watch.

- que:
  - How you doing, great one?
  ans:
  - I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.

- que:
  - Sorry. What are those cards?
  ans:
  - Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.

- que:
  - Terrify me?
  ans:
  - See, he's right. I need the cards. Simon, you're broke.

- que:
  - No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
  ans:
  - Sure thing.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Just move on. No one here killed him.

- que:
  - Oh, is he dead?
  ans:
  - Ask him.

- que:
  - My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
  ans:
  - I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.

- que:
  - Which color was that?
  ans:
  - Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...

- que:
  - How're you doing?
  ans:
  - Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.

- que:
  - Do you realize that I work at him?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't.

- que:
  - Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
  ans:
  - No... actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...

- que:
  - Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
  ans:
  - Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me.

- que:
  - Verdell?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

- que:
  - It smells like shit in here?
  ans:
  - Go away.

- que:
  - Where are all your queer party friends?
  ans:
  - Get out.

- que:
  - Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
  ans:
  - Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.

- que:
  - Would you leave now, please?
  ans:
  - Stupid dog. I don't get it.

- que:
  - Got any easier questions?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
  ans:
  - Melvin...

- que:
  - Does it matter?
  ans:
  - I told you to go on in.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.

- que:
  - They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
  ans:
  - I love you.

- que:
  - You going to come talk to me or not?
  ans:
  - I'm coming.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:
  - I'm a great guy -- \"extraordinary\"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here.

- que:
  - Because... ... you love her?
  ans:
  - No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.

- que:
  - Did you like it that much?
  ans:
  - Picking on me won't help.

- que:
  - But you know where you're lucky?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I forgot to lock the door.

- que:
  - What's it mean?
  ans:
  - That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... in here.

- que:
  - How do you write women so well?
  ans:
  - I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.

- que:
  - Exactly what is your previous experience?
  ans:
  - How about that pose? This is not fun... Give me some direction.

- que:
  - So you're practically finished, huh?
  ans:
  - No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there... I just want to tell you...

- que:
  - No. No problem. The airport, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - So you're from around here?
  ans:
  - No. No I'm not.

- que:
  - Not too good at small talk, eh?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.

- que:
  - Why? What happened?
  ans:
  - No shit.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That was Peterson back there. That goes to the expressway for the airport.

- que:
  - What? You think I'm running you up?
  ans:
  - Just do your job.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Get out. You think I'm running you up? Get out.

- que:
  - How long have you been freelance?
  ans:
  - We both know what you were doing.

- que:
  - After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
  ans:
  - Robert Bain, driving me! Jesus fucking Christ!

- que:
  - So what happens now?
  ans:
  - We go around once.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - No, no. Wait. You don't want me to jump. You're going to jump. I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!

- que:
  - How'd you know? Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
  ans:
  - I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.

- que:
  - What does that fucking mean?
  ans:
  - It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.

- que:
  - Five million dollars?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah.

- que:
  - Michael?
  ans:
  - No. No. No. I don't believe it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Where have you been, Robert?
  ans:
  - Sick. The flu.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The contract was stolen.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - A new player. He's using the name Nicholai.

- que:
  - Know what?
  ans:
  - The fucking contract! How in the fuck did he know.

- que:
  - Deadline?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow. The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.

- que:
  - Who is the mark?
  ans:
  - Freelancer. A woman. Surveillance specialist.

- que:
  - The contract?
  ans:
  - Paid in full.

- que:
  - You think this is a fucking joke?
  ans:
  - $1,000,000.

- que:
  - He has to clean up. How many bodies were there?
  ans:
  - Um, five.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Nikita? She helped me find you.

- que:
  - What? How did you know I had a cat?
  ans:
  - Took a guess. Lucky for you, I guessed right.

- que:
  - Who the fuck are you? Who do you work for?
  ans:
  - I work for the government.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Bullshit.

- que:
  - What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
  ans:
  - The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Turn off the engine.

- que:
  - You want me to pump?
  ans:
  - No, stay in the car. I want you to understand something. If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.

- que:
  - Okay. How did you find me?
  ans:
  - You're the computer hacker, you tell me.

- que:
  - Nikita?
  ans:
  - Yellow Pages. V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.

- que:
  - An assassin?
  ans:
  - Until a minute ago.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.

- que:
  - Who is that other guy?
  ans:
  - Another contractor.

- que:
  - Someone hired both of you?
  ans:
  - No. They hired Bain. The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.

- que:
  - So this is something between you and him?
  ans:
  - He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because he is trying to retire me.

- que:
  - He wants to kill you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - The nature of the business. You remove your competition.

- que:
  - And you want to use me to get him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Oh Jesus Jesus...

- que:
  - Just Electra?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - As in daughter of Agamemnon?
  ans:
  - No. Just Electra.

- que:
  - If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I'm done.

- que:
  - This is crazy. I can't trust you. You can't trust me. How can we possibly help each other?
  ans:
  - With computers.

- que:
  - It's not the same, is it?
  ans:
  - Better than playing with yourself.

- que:
  - Had?
  ans:
  - It looks like white's game.

- que:
  - Why didn't you finish this game?
  ans:
  - He was... taken.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because that's how it works. That's what it's about. He was the best. He was on top.

- que:
  - How did you get into the business?
  ans:
  - The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.

- que:
  - The C.I.A.?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - How old were you?
  ans:
  - They recruited me when I was in high school.

- que:
  - Jesus -- why?
  ans:
  - Languages. I was already fluent in nine languages.

- que:
  - You were like a boy genius?
  ans:
  - Some people said that. I never thought so.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I was just different.

- que:
  - You went from high school to the Agency?
  ans:
  - No. I graduated from George Washington University. Then I entered the Agency training program.

- que:
  - They didn't give you a choice, did they?
  ans:
  - No, they didn't.

- que:
  - But you knew what they were training you for?
  ans:
  - Of course. I was going to be James Bond.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because you are a women.

- que:
  - They tried to kill you?
  ans:
  - Yes. It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.

- que:
  - Then you went freelance?
  ans:
  - Tell me about the first time.

- que:
  - My first take?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I want to know.

- que:
  - Are they usually like that?
  ans:
  - No. Just the first one.

- que:
  - After that?
  ans:
  - They become complicated... messy.

- que:
  - Did it ever bother James Bond?
  ans:
  - Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...

- que:
  - Do you have a passport?
  ans:
  - Several.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - Mexico.

- que:
  - Hey, where are you?
  ans:
  - Thinking.

- que:
  - About?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico. Is it as nice as they say?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You were there?
  ans:
  - That's where he'll be.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I wasn't expecting this. I need to think.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It helps me to focus. It centers me, helps me think.

- que:
  - Oh. What do you think about?
  ans:
  - Work. The things I need to get done.

- que:
  - Do you think about the game?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Not even a stalemate?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
  ans:
  - I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.

- que:
  - Here?
  ans:
  - In Costa Blanca.

- que:
  - What do you think he's doing?
  ans:
  - I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - He won't be looking for you. Just be careful. Buy a book. Keep your sunglasses on.

- que:
  - How was the beach?
  ans:
  - The beach? It was nice.

- que:
  - Where did you learn it?
  ans:
  - Taiwan.

- que:
  - Two way?
  ans:
  - Transmits and receives.

- que:
  - Okay. Then what?
  ans:
  - Then, we wait.

- que:
  - What? What if he brings it with him?
  ans:
  - He can't. The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.

- que:
  - We split the money?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is it? I don't like this at all. What is going on here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It just happened. I was here ten years ago, I'm here now. That's it.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank. He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.

- que:
  - What did he want?
  ans:
  - He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business. To disappear to some empty Greek island.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He said I couldn't win. That no one wins at this game.

- que:
  - Was that it?
  ans:
  - Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.

- que:
  - Do you have ulcers?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
  ans:
  - I hate bishops. They're useless. I like knights.

- que:
  - Did you think they were newlyweds?
  ans:
  - I didn't notice them.

- que:
  - How do you know they're not?
  ans:
  - I went into their room this afternoon.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It was no big deal. I saw them leave, I went in.

- que:
  - Why in the hell would you take that chance?
  ans:
  - I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them. I wanted to, so I did.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - It's always been that way. The world has always functioned on two levels.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.

- que:
  - And you were drilling these holes...?
  ans:
  - So I could watch the girl that lived under me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's a ridiculous move.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because, I'll take it.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you will.

- que:
  - Am I attractive?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you attracted to me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
  ans:
  - Both.

- que:
  - Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to complicate the situation.

- que:
  - Attraction is a complication?
  ans:
  - It can be.

- que:
  - It happened to you before?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who was she?
  ans:
  - Someone like me, like you. A pro.

- que:
  - What happened to her?
  ans:
  - She was taken.

- que:
  - Was she the only one?
  ans:
  - After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.

- que:
  - Is this becoming complicated?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure that I care anymore.

- que:
  - Were you attracted to me right away?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Honestly?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - That doesn't sound normal.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I waited another four minutes.

- que:
  - Jesus! Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.

- que:
  - Would you like a drink?
  ans:
  - I'd love one. Whatever you're having.

- que:
  - Why are you working today?
  ans:
  - Holidays are our busiest days. No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.

- que:
  - You're very good at this aren't you?
  ans:
  - I think you're supposed to answer that question.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Honesty.

- que:
  - Do you ever regret things you've done?
  ans:
  - Everyone regrets something.

- que:
  - But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - Do you think about their wives or their families?
  ans:
  - No. They call me, I don't call them. If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.

- que:
  - Do you ever think about starting over?
  ans:
  - All the time.

- que:
  - Can you tell me about it?
  ans:
  - Then, I'll sail alone.

- que:
  - Is that all you want?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How much farther?
  ans:
  - Just a little ways. Up to those trees.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?' I don't know. Maybe I didn't trust her.

- que:
  - You're pretty famous aren't you?
  ans:
  - I hope not.

- que:
  - One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
  ans:
  - Average.

- que:
  - That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - What are you thinking about?
  ans:
  - And an R.C.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - What do other guys do?
  ans:
  - Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.

- que:
  - Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
  ans:
  - Some.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - You mean quit?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Look at that. I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You wish to close this account today?
  ans:
  - That's correct.

- que:
  - How would you like the funds?
  ans:
  - American currency.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate. Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
  ans:
  - Of course, senor.

- que:
  - Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.

- que:
  - So how's your work?
  ans:
  - It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.

- que:
  - Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
  ans:
  - Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.

- que:
  - It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
  ans:
  - I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.

- que:
  - Like you?
  ans:
  - No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.

- que:
  - No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
  ans:
  - Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.

- que:
  - You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
  ans:
  - You guys having a go a me or what?

- que:
  - What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
  ans:
  - Yeah, let's check out the low-life.

- que:
  - Anything in it?
  ans:
  - No, just crap. I want some picture frames.

- que:
  - Never heard of K-MART?
  ans:
  - I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.

- que:
  - Who's your friend?
  ans:
  - Fifteen crowns.

- que:
  - I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, what's that?

- que:
  - No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
  ans:
  - Squatted it.

- que:
  - So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
  ans:
  - What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.

- que:
  - You've got to stop using that word \"we\" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
  ans:
  - He's not drunk, he's crazy.

- que:
  - Like Custer huh?
  ans:
  - These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.

- que:
  - Care to elaborate?
  ans:
  - Amazing, he didn't even say \"if\".

- que:
  - No \"if's\" or \"but's\" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
  ans:
  - Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.

- que:
  - It's big, right Jahn?
  ans:
  - Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.

- que:
  - You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
  ans:
  - You got my word on it.

- que:
  - He was an electrician?
  ans:
  - No, he was talking about girls, I think.

- que:
  - Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
  ans:
  - Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?

- que:
  - Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
  ans:
  - Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.

- que:
  - And put it on expenses?
  ans:
  - Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - You sure got a handle on that word \"we\".

- que:
  - A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
  ans:
  - I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.

- que:
  - And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
  ans:
  - No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.

- que:
  - No, why?
  ans:
  - cause you stink of booze.

- que:
  - I'm an idiot?
  ans:
  - Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
  ans:
  - None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.

- que:
  - Can you do the lock on it?
  ans:
  - No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.

- que:
  - But how did the wall get here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.

- que:
  - And suppose a little old lady lives there?
  ans:
  - No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.

- que:
  - I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
  ans:
  - I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.

- que:
  - Need any disks?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'll take some.

- que:
  - Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
  ans:
  - See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.

- que:
  - Moved on to plumbing huh?
  ans:
  - We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.

- que:
  - I thought you were gonna throw these?
  ans:
  - I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.

- que:
  - Have you ever stolen anything?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Like helping a sick kid?
  ans:
  - No, for the Asylum.

- que:
  - Am I late?
  ans:
  - No, not if you've got better things to do.

- que:
  - Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
  ans:
  - Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.

- que:
  - No beer?
  ans:
  - Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.

- que:
  - Red or white?
  ans:
  - Both, see you later.

- que:
  - Have you cleared all the rubble up?
  ans:
  - No, not yet.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.

- que:
  - My God! What happened?
  ans:
  - I fell in love.

- que:
  - And a tram hit you?
  ans:
  - No, the boyfriend.

- que:
  - What happened to Katka?
  ans:
  - Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.

- que:
  - Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
  ans:
  - It just happened.

- que:
  - She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
  ans:
  - She's cool.

- que:
  - What are you on about?
  ans:
  - Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.

- que:
  - Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
  ans:
  - Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.

- que:
  - Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
  ans:
  - It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.

- que:
  - Tell me some bad news?
  ans:
  - I don't want to ruin your day.

- que:
  - That bad?
  ans:
  - Your too good for this town, Buddy.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.

- que:
  - They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.

- que:
  - Did you see anything in the files?
  ans:
  - It was all in Czech wasn't it.

- que:
  - Yeah, somewhere?
  ans:
  - Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.

- que:
  - Do you want me to see what's on them?
  ans:
  - No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Dave Walters.

- que:
  - Good, what's his number?
  ans:
  - It's...42 56 76 .

- que:
  - Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
  ans:
  - God, I think I need a holiday.

- que:
  - Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
  ans:
  - I'm not hungry, really.

- que:
  - We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
  ans:
  - I can't go with him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It was a condition of getting Doug out.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.

- que:
  - Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
  ans:
  - You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?

- que:
  - Do you know the way?
  ans:
  - Sure, it's on the red metro line you....

- que:
  - No, by road?
  ans:
  - Yeah, pretty well.

- que:
  - There shooting at something.
  ans:
  - That one?

- que:
  - I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
  ans:
  - Doug?

- que:
  - You mean your NOT going to spring me?
  ans:
  - So am I.

- que:
  - Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No!
  ans:
  - They didn't look like medical files to me.

- que:
  - Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
  ans:
  - Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.

- que:
  - Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
  ans:
  - Doug, haven't seen you for a while.

- que:
  - I could pencil you in if you like?
  ans:
  - I'll take a rain-check for now.

- que:
  - Turned Czech huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, maybe.

- que:
  - Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
  ans:
  - You used to read.

- que:
  - So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
  ans:
  - Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.

- que:
  - So, we won't be going to London?
  ans:
  - No, not just yet.

- que:
  - I hope you're going to invite me in?
  ans:
  - Fernet and tonic.

- que:
  - That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
  ans:
  - Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.

- que:
  - No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
  ans:
  - Will it help to get you out?

- que:
  - I don't understand, it's your home?
  ans:
  - There's nothing there for me.

- que:
  - Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
  ans:
  - Sure, I've done it easily.

- que:
  - Hi, want to take up dancing?
  ans:
  - Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.

- que:
  - So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
  ans:
  - Sure, they are students.

- que:
  - Can we charge admission?
  ans:
  - Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.

- que:
  - Great. And your all set for the performance?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.

- que:
  - Great....How long will it go for?
  ans:
  - About forty minutes.

- que:
  - Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course...maybe one hour.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.

- que:
  - A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
  ans:
  - I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.

- que:
  - Will this thing take long?
  ans:
  - No, it should be over soon.

- que:
  - You mean it's started?
  ans:
  - Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.

- que:
  - How do I know what's being said?
  ans:
  - I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.

- que:
  - Am I invited?
  ans:
  - Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.

- que:
  - Why are you doing all this, what for?
  ans:
  - Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.

- que:
  - What's the Bugler?
  ans:
  - It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.

- que:
  - I figured you more as a Socialist?
  ans:
  - I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.

- que:
  - A champion of lost causes huh?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.

- que:
  - Shall I wash these out?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.

- que:
  - Is it dry?
  ans:
  - Yeah seems okay.

- que:
  - What would you like, beer?
  ans:
  - No, just a coffee.

- que:
  - Who you saving the dishes for?
  ans:
  - Guests.

- que:
  - Don't you have a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - Run into Josh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but it was okay.

- que:
  - How did he look?
  ans:
  - Better than you.

- que:
  - Where did you steal the car?
  ans:
  - It's Josh's.

- que:
  - This is your doing?
  ans:
  - Yes, they had nothing to do with it.

- que:
  - And you broke into that room?
  ans:
  - It was the biggest I could find.

- que:
  - What was the real purpose behind this venture?
  ans:
  - A kind of freedom.

- que:
  - I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
  ans:
  - Enjoying our hospitality?

- que:
  - The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
  ans:
  - What is it you want?

- que:
  - And the students?
  ans:
  - I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.

- que:
  - You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
  ans:
  - I'll need to make a phone call.

- que:
  - I insist, it is the least we can do.
  ans:
  - Would you like your things now?

- que:
  - Hey Doug, where you been?
  ans:
  - Working....Under cover.

- que:
  - Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
  ans:
  - Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.

- que:
  - No problem, is it at your place?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So, he didn't fire you?
  ans:
  - No way, he even gave me back pay.

- que:
  - When the hell did you write that?
  ans:
  - Just yesterday.

- que:
  - Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
  ans:
  - Later.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't want to go.

- que:
  - Will you come home and forget all about him?
  ans:
  - Yes, if you can get him free.

- que:
  - Why are there still such headlines?
  ans:
  - This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.

- que:
  - You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
  ans:
  - In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.

- que:
  - You are quite sure it's secure?
  ans:
  - The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.

- que:
  - You are responsible...What has happened?
  ans:
  - We're not sure...

- que:
  - The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
  ans:
  - Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.

- que:
  - Have you lost all control of this city?
  ans:
  - I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.

- que:
  - And what of these foreigners?
  ans:
  - I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.

- que:
  - And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
  ans:
  - All the more reason to eliminate him.

- que:
  - What if his accomplices have made copies?
  ans:
  - It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.

- que:
  - She asleep?
  ans:
  - I'll tell her you were here.

- que:
  - What if they expel you?
  ans:
  - Kelly wouldn't do that.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Cuz nothing happened at school.

- que:
  - Bout what?
  ans:
  - About a job.

- que:
  - Out with Belinda?
  ans:
  - That's over. Way over.

- que:
  - You saw him?
  ans:
  - We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.

- que:
  - You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
  ans:
  - You look nice. I should have dressed.

- que:
  - To see your father?
  ans:
  - No. I won't be long.

- que:
  - Were you with Jamie?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You sleeping with her?
  ans:
  - Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing. Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - He wants to talk to you.

- que:
  - What kind of a man are you, son?
  ans:
  - Get yourself a glass.

- que:
  - Were?
  ans:
  - You don't know me.

- que:
  - -- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
  ans:
  - You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.

- que:
  - Can't you have a normal conversation?
  ans:
  - I don't want to have any conversation.

- que:
  - This play -- ?
  ans:
  - -- I know you don't suck at acting.

- que:
  - Because that's where the fire is?
  ans:
  - 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.

- que:
  - I'm an enemy?
  ans:
  - Kinda. Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
  ans:
  - Maybe a little of both.

- que:
  - So what else is on this list?
  ans:
  - It's private.

- que:
  - Because I try to be nice to people?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.

- que:
  - Do you think I'm strange?
  ans:
  - Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.

- que:
  - The world of the dead?
  ans:
  - Could be...

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - That is my telescope.

- que:
  - Looking for intelligent life?
  ans:
  - Looking for something -- someone.

- que:
  - Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
  ans:
  - I hope so. I think maybe she sees me now.

- que:
  - In ten words or less?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't believe in anything?
  ans:
  - The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.

- que:
  - Yes. And?
  ans:
  - Oh. Just not at school...

- que:
  - He okay?
  ans:
  - Healthy as can be.

- que:
  - And that would ruin your reputation how?
  ans:
  - Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.

- que:
  - So you're talking to me?
  ans:
  - When I have something to say.

- que:
  - No. But are you -- impressed?
  ans:
  - Like fire.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'm not allowed to date.

- que:
  - Is there a rush?
  ans:
  - I have to get you home by one.

- que:
  - We're doing something -- ?
  ans:
  - Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Fun.

- que:
  - That what's happening to you, only faster?
  ans:
  - Stand right here.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - You're acting like a crazy person.

- que:
  - You're sometimes not sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure. Pretty sure.

- que:
  - What do you actually know with religion?
  ans:
  - Wonder. Beauty. Joy. Love.

- que:
  - Loved?
  ans:
  - That. And less strange.

- que:
  - Assholes. This happen to you?
  ans:
  - Twice a year.

- que:
  - What's wr--?
  ans:
  - The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Away from here.

- que:
  - How do you know this place?
  ans:
  - Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.

- que:
  - What would you do up here?
  ans:
  - Look. Talk. Not talk.

- que:
  - What'd you tell your father?
  ans:
  - The truth. I just left you out of it.

- que:
  - When did you build this?
  ans:
  - I was twelve.

- que:
  - So what do you want to see?
  ans:
  - Mars.

- que:
  - What about your father?
  ans:
  - I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.

- que:
  - What's the best thing I can see tonight?
  ans:
  - Me.

- que:
  - Can you locate XXI5639I?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
  ans:
  - Here. Why am I looking at this star?

- que:
  - That what you do?
  ans:
  - Yes. I try to keep my power.

- que:
  - You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you going to -- ?
  ans:
  - Pull over.

- que:
  - Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
  ans:
  - Where? Why?

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible. I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.

- que:
  - Are you frightened?
  ans:
  - All the time. I feel like I have no one.

- que:
  - Help me live until I die?
  ans:
  - I will.

- que:
  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - That I want you to take me home.

- que:
  - You know how to waltz?
  ans:
  - I was going to fake it.

- que:
  - How you doing?
  ans:
  - Tired.

- que:
  - How're you doing?
  ans:
  - Better. I was really angry.

- que:
  - Because you have hope that you'll get better?
  ans:
  - No. Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself. Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...

- que:
  - Can I -- go out?
  ans:
  - You'll be fine for a few minutes.

- que:
  - Will you do something for me?
  ans:
  - Landon. I can't even do for myself.

- que:
  - But if you could, you would?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to see him outside school activities.

- que:
  - Up to?
  ans:
  - I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.

- que:
  - Did you give him a gift?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're in the play?
  ans:
  - Lead man.

- que:
  - Does it have to do with Jamie?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Like what, sir?
  ans:
  - You decide.

- que:
  - How about your family?
  ans:
  - Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.

- que:
  - Materially or spiritually?
  ans:
  - Either. Both.

- que:
  - How -- how long does she have?
  ans:
  - Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.

- que:
  - I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
  ans:
  - In there.

- que:
  - You have materials for the side bearings?
  ans:
  - I'm using an old phonographic turntable.

- que:
  - You know about this stuff?
  ans:
  - I helped Jamie with the first one.

- que:
  - Yes. You?
  ans:
  - Getting by.

- que:
  - Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - I'd work backstage or something?
  ans:
  - Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.

- que:
  - When do I get time for me?
  ans:
  - You don't. That's the point.

- que:
  - Where did you get -- ?
  ans:
  - It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.

- que:
  - You came here to give me my report card?
  ans:
  - I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.

- que:
  - Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - A similar triangle?
  ans:
  - What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.

- que:
  - Scalene?
  ans:
  - Okay. Make me an isosceles.

- que:
  - What do you want, Biff?
  ans:
  - Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.

- que:
  - This is 1952....?
  ans:
  - Uh, yes, sir...

- que:
  - And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
  ans:
  - No....

- que:
  - Marty. What's for breakfast?
  ans:
  - Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.

- que:
  - Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?
  ans:
  - Third time they've been out there this week.

- que:
  - How was school today?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Learn anything?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Seventeen.

- que:
  - Have we ever met before?
  ans:
  - Hi, Marty.

- que:
  - You remember me...?
  ans:
  - How could I forget? Oh, sure, I remember you.

- que:
  - What time does school start around here?
  ans:
  - Nine o' clock. Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.

- que:
  - You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
  ans:
  - I think I know exactly what you mean.

- que:
  - By the way, that reminds me... Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
  ans:
  - You do?

- que:
  - Eileen, Chinese food again?
  ans:
  - George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.

- que:
  - Uh, hi, Eileen.
  ans:
  - Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?

- que:
  - What drill?
  ans:
  - The drill! The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.

- que:
  - Learn anything?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Not now....
  ans:
  - The sunrise? What for?

- que:
  - And where am I gonna be?
  ans:
  - Maybe if I used my left....

- que:
  - Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
  ans:
  - Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.

- que:
  - You have a name?
  ans:
  - Marty. Marty Lewis.

- que:
  - Who, me?
  ans:
  - You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class. If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.

- que:
  - Run out of gas?
  ans:
  - Operator...

- que:
  - Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
  ans:
  - Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.

- que:
  - Operator, what's today's date?
  ans:
  - March 11th.

- que:
  - REESE Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
  ans:
  - Home, school, here...

- que:
  - BROWN Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
  ans:
  - Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.

- que:
  - BROWN Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
  ans:
  - Eight thirty.

- que:
  - BROWN A gold mine?
  ans:
  - Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...

- que:
  - Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
  ans:
  - Professor? Professor Brown?

- que:
  - You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
  ans:
  - BROWN A mall?

- que:
  - BROWN Pardon me?
  ans:
  - Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.

- que:
  - BROWN Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works... What chemicals do we use?
  ans:
  - Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....

- que:
  - How did you know?
  ans:
  - Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed... I'd stick out like a sore thumb.

- que:
  - Professor, be serious, would you?
  ans:
  - You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!

- que:
  - BROWN Say, where did this guitar come from?
  ans:
  - Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.

- que:
  - BROWN Where did you get this?
  ans:
  - I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.

- que:
  - Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
  ans:
  - BROWN In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.

- que:
  - That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
  ans:
  - That's just what I needed to hear.

- que:
  - Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
  ans:
  - BROWN There's no way of knowing.

- que:
  - Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
  ans:
  - BROWN You didn't?

- que:
  - BROWN Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
  ans:
  - What year is this?

- que:
  - What do you call this?
  ans:
  - BROWN A car.

- que:
  - But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
  ans:
  - Obviously!

- que:
  - What theater was I at?
  ans:
  - BROWN The Orpheum.

- que:
  - It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A Tab.

- que:
  - Dick? Dick who?
  ans:
  - Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.

- que:
  - Hi. where's Cato?
  ans:
  - Well, he's gone.

- que:
  - Gone?... Where?
  ans:
  - He said not to tell.

- que:
  - Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
  ans:
  - No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Can't afford to take chances.

- que:
  - You promise to stay down there for an hour?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How you doing, Cato?
  ans:
  - Not bad.

- que:
  - What you been doing?
  ans:
  - Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.

- que:
  - Where'd you get them antlers?
  ans:
  - They come with the house.

- que:
  - That's what he told you, huh?
  ans:
  - No, he showed me one.

- que:
  - Don't you ever get bored around here?
  ans:
  - Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.

- que:
  - What'd they look like?
  ans:
  - Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.

- que:
  - That your spider in there? In that bottle?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What do you feed him?
  ans:
  - Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.

- que:
  - Does he bite?
  ans:
  - He never bit me.

- que:
  - You ever held another job before?
  ans:
  - I used to throw trash for the City.

- que:
  - You lost that one?
  ans:
  - Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

- que:
  - What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
  ans:
  - I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.

- que:
  - Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
  ans:
  - Thirty aught six.

- que:
  - You ever had to open it up like that before?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - You like people?
  ans:
  - They're okay.

- que:
  - Then why'd you do it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.

- que:
  - Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
  ans:
  - I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.

- que:
  - Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
  ans:
  - Sure thing. Come on.

- que:
  - What'd you come out here for?
  ans:
  - I wasn't aware there was any law against it.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - For coming onto my property... With a gun.

- que:
  - Yeah? Why not?
  ans:
  - Cause I can't allow it.

- que:
  - What's going to happen to Jack and me?
  ans:
  - You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.

- que:
  - What's your friend's name?
  ans:
  - Jack.

- que:
  - You love him?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like \"druthers\", doesn't it?
  ans:
  - It's okay.

- que:
  - You still in school?
  ans:
  - Nah, I got me a job.

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.

- que:
  - Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
  ans:
  - Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.

- que:
  - Can I be honest?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - He'll say that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
  ans:
  - Spanish.

- que:
  - How do you say \"Quit my Job\" in Spanish?
  ans:
  - Something mi trabajo.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You want to go for a ride?
  ans:
  - Well, I got homework.

- que:
  - Anybody ever call you \"Red\"?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but I don't like it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Just don't... I've got a headache.

- que:
  - Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is that all there is to it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
  ans:
  - Don't ask me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.

- que:
  - How bad off is he?
  ans:
  - I can look and see.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - You don't believe me, see for yourself.

- que:
  - Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
  ans:
  - Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.

- que:
  - How you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. Kind of tired.

- que:
  - How's he doing?
  ans:
  - I got him in the stomach.

- que:
  - Is he upset?
  ans:
  - He didn't say anything to me about it.

- que:
  - Think I got 'em?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What'd you put him in there for?
  ans:
  - Just to keep him out of the sun.

- que:
  - You tired?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well, why you always walking behind me?
  ans:
  - Don't.

- que:
  - Anybody ever done that to you before?
  ans:
  - No.

  ans:
  - Then that's it!

- que:
  - You wanna take the chance, Casper?
  ans:
  - Not me. No way.

- que:
  - The creatures? They attacked you? They tried to possess you?
  ans:
  - Smells fermented. Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think. Look...

- que:
  - Ever since that phony phone call from the President. Look at this. What is it?
  ans:
  - It's your hand, Buckaroo.

- que:
  - Antidote to what? Whose disguises?

  - Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.

  ans:
  - Planet 10?

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - Vanished. Thin air.

- que:
  - Have you warned Professor Hikita?

  - I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Just grazed me. The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...

- que:
  - Apache?
  ans:
  - Arachtoid.

- que:
  - Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
  ans:
  - Not really. This is pretty important.

- que:
  - Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay?
  ans:
  - I look great. Let's rock 'n' roll.

- que:
  - Hey, any lock can be picked. So what's he up to?
  ans:
  - I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

- que:
  - Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

- que:
  - What is it, Tommy?
  ans:
  - It's Whorfin, Buckaroo. Line 3.

- que:
  - All accounted for? Where's Penny?
  ans:
  - New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire. Quite a guy if you want my opinion.

- que:
  - What is this thing? A fighter?
  ans:
  - Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

- que:
  - Where're you goin'?
  ans:
  - To get my guns.

- que:
  - Raise your hand...where?
  ans:
  - This is so embarrassing...

- que:
  - Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Penny. I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

- que:
  - Did you say...\"Peggy\"?
  ans:
  - My name is Penny. Penny Priddy. There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you. I'm a nobody.

- que:
  - He offered you money?
  ans:
  - This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck.

- que:
  - My name's, Penny! But who cares?
  ans:
  - Let me go, let me go, you creeps...

- que:
  - What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
  ans:
  - I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.

- que:
  - Who were you really trying to kill last night?
  ans:
  - You. Like the papers all say.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The girl I remind you of.

- que:
  - Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
  ans:
  - No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot, you know everything.

- que:
  - Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Which? The one in my throat.

- que:
  - Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...

- que:
  - Another 'you'?
  ans:
  - Somewhere. See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby. I was adopted.

- que:
  - Go where? Where're you going?
  ans:
  - Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.

- que:
  - What? If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
  ans:
  - Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.

- que:
  - Believe in Penny Priddy?
  ans:
  - World Watch One. Direct incoming transmission.

- que:
  - That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo. What's it like out there in the real world?
  ans:
  - You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo. We know each other pretty well, I think.

- que:
  - Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
  ans:
  - MAN No, sir. I think the flint...

- que:
  - What's happening with my call to SAC?
  ans:
  - MAN Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command. They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

- que:
  - How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
  ans:
  - Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta scrapes together.

- que:
  - What'd you do before? Can I ask?
  ans:
  - Government work. Had my own think tank. Got tired of thinking-wanted some action. Seen plenty of it too. So will you if you stick around.

- que:
  - Where's Buckaroo? Is he alive?
  ans:
  - Course he's alive. He's Buckaroo Banzai.

- que:
  - Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women. Can you play that thing?
  ans:
  - Better than him.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - Pick those up, Reno.

- que:
  - Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
  ans:
  - You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius.

- que:
  - Where do you hail from, Doc?
  ans:
  - Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - Cause Buckaroo needs me here.

- que:
  - Asshole probably got lost.
  ans:
  - Any sign of Buckaroo?

- que:
  - Unscheduled surgery. He'll be waltzing along momentarily. What're you doing tonight?
  ans:
  - Flying to Cambodia.

- que:
  - Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
  ans:
  - She's just a damn road hugger, Allison. Plus the man can drive.

- que:
  - Is, uh... Is he okay?
  ans:
  - He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.

  - What do I write about?
  ans:
  - Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.

  ans:
  - ...Yeah, okay.

- que:
  - Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
  ans:
  - Seems like nothing but, lately.

- que:
  - How did you know about that?
  ans:
  - Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.

  - It hurts.

- que:
  - Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
  ans:
  - Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets? I don't do those.

- que:
  - Do you think I told her to kill You?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
  ans:
  - For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.

- que:
  - I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
  ans:
  - No?

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - About three months before I met you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'd read about your shootings in the papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my character.

- que:
  - What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.

- que:
  - Do you believe me?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.

- que:
  - Can I talk to you a minute?
  ans:
  - Honey, why don't you go in the car? I'll be right there.

- que:
  - I just thought I'd surprise you. What's the matter?
  ans:
  - I found Lisa Henderson.

- que:
  - Did you? What's she doing?
  ans:
  - You're not going to tell me what she's doing. I thought we weren't playing games anymore.

- que:
  - You still think I kill people, don't you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How'd you get in here?
  ans:
  - I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.

- que:
  - Did you miss me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you researching?
  ans:
  - I'm writing a book.

- que:
  - What happens to them?
  ans:

  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Somebody has to die.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Somebody always does.

- que:
  - How did it end?
  ans:
  - I told you. She kills him.

- que:
  - What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?
  ans:
  - The games are over. You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.

- que:
  - What do we do now, Nick?
  ans:
  - We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after.

- que:
  - I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms. Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like some coffee?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
  ans:

  - Did you ever tie him up?
  ans:

  - How did he die?
  ans:
  - He was murdered.

- que:
  - Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How?
  ans:
  - I don't really feel like talking anymore.

- que:
  - You workin' on another book?
  ans:
  - Yes I am.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.

- que:
  - Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - What kind of drugs?
  ans:
  - Cocaine.

- que:
  - That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
  ans:
  - I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.

- que:
  - What was the weapon?
  ans:
  - .38 revolver. Never recovered.

- que:
  - Were there ever any suspects?
  ans:
  - No suspects, no motive. Unsolved.

  ans:
  - Routine.

- que:
  - Do you remember his name?
  ans:
  - Nope, can't say that I do.

- que:
  - Nilsen?
  ans:
  - That's him.

- que:
  - Was she ever a suspect?
  ans:
  - Nope. There was some talk; it never panned.

- que:
  - What kind of talk?
  ans:
  - The usual -- a girlfriend.

- que:
  - He had a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned.

- que:
  - Who was this fuckin' guy?
  ans:
  - Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

- que:
  - Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
  ans:
  - They're executives. They're nervous about everything.

- que:
  - How'd it go, son?
  ans:
  - She misses me.

- que:
  - What you doin', son?
  ans:
  - It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.

- que:
  - Was she ever suspect?
  ans:
  - No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.

- que:
  - What's goin' down, son?
  ans:
  - Nothin' I'll be okay, pop.

- que:
  - What is it you got between you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
  ans:
  - She want to play? Fine. I can play.

- que:
  - I'm not afraid of her.
  ans:
  - You don't like punk rockers?

- que:
  - Why the hell not?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm just not.

- que:
  - You all right, pop? You want me to drive you?
  ans:
  - Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.

- que:
  - You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
  ans:
  - I don't believe it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You're my friend, Gus.

- que:
  - So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what. You don't know what the hell was in it?
  ans:
  - Catherine told me what was in it.

- que:
  - How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
  ans:
  - He was I.A. He probably asked her about it.

- que:
  - Where the hell you goin'?
  ans:
  - I'm going with you.

- que:
  - Were you with him last night?
  ans:
  - You're looking for Catherine, not me.

- que:
  - What was the motive?
  ans:
  - She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse. The razor just happened to be there.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - Keep your three o'clock.

- que:
  - Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
  ans:
  - Are you kidding me?

- que:
  - So what do we do -- nothing?
  ans:
  - We bring her in for questioning.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it.

- que:
  - How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
  ans:
  - Fuck you, Phil.

- que:
  - I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
  ans:
  - Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

- que:
  - You knew her, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down.

- que:
  - On what basis?
  ans:
  - I'm Roxy. I'm her -- friend.

- que:
  - How old was she when this happened?
  ans:
  - Fourteen. We seal juvenile records until they're deceased. That's why you didn't find it in your computer.

- que:
  - Did you check all four years?
  ans:
  - Yes I did.

- que:
  - Can you check again?
  ans:
  - No Lisa Anderson, detective.

- que:
  - Can there be some mistake?
  ans:
  - Only if you're making it.

- que:
  - No. Should I have?
  ans:
  - I'm a painter, too.

- que:
  - Is this finished yet?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Not sure. How was yours?
  ans:
  - I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - It's always how you would do it. This is my version.

- que:
  - Why, so you could humiliate me?
  ans:
  - No, I wanted to make a painting of you.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - The whole thing  painting.

- que:
  - What about the shit they write?
  ans:
  - I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.

- que:
  - Ignorant art?
  ans:
  - Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.

- que:
  - Do you still love her?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.

- que:
  - What's with the wigs?
  ans:
  - I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.

- que:
  - Piss painting?
  ans:
  - I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.

  ans:
  - I don't like beer.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Annina Nosei.

- que:
  - Is Jean Michel here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How much for these five?
  ans:
  - You should talk to him about this.

- que:
  - I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
  ans:
  - You name it, I paint there.

- que:
  - How about right now?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Just look at him. Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.

- que:
  - B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
  ans:
  - I didn't see you.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You haven't heard? Andy's dead.

- que:
  - Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
  ans:
  - I need a dealer.

- que:
  - What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
  ans:
  - I hate this. Turn that off.

- que:
  - Yes. What do they... stand for?
  ans:
  - They're just words.

- que:
  - Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
  ans:
  - Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from? Everywhere.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - Leeches. A long list of leeches. It looks good like that.

- que:
  - I use a lot of colors  not only black.
  ans:
  - You mean like an ape?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not black.

- que:
  - Not what?
  ans:
  - Not black.

- que:
  - Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
  ans:
  - Why, that's from Time Magazine.

- que:
  - Would you like to see the wine list?
  ans:
  - Chateau Latour '64, please.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Out?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Maybe just his arms. Put some Cerulean Blue there.

- que:
  -  In this corner?
  ans:
  - Yeah..

- que:
  - You want me to put it here?
  ans:
  - Use your fucking instinct.

- que:
  - It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
  ans:
  - Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you today?
  ans:
  - Hey  Willie Mays.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..

  ans:
  - What're you doing? You're doing something.

  ans:
  - Yeah... I'll paint on it.

- que:
  - What's the rush, John Henry?
  ans:
  - I ain't John Henry.

- que:
  - What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
  ans:
  - I don't really have any problems.

- que:
  - Good. What do you have?
  ans:
  - What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.

- que:
  - Can I walk you home?
  ans:
  - I think I could do that alone.

- que:
  - Party girls? Can I call you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.

- que:
  - I thought you hated this place?
  ans:
  - I do. I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.

- que:
  - Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
  ans:
  - C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.

- que:
  - I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear? How could you do that to me?
  ans:
  - ... I'll buy you some new ones.

- que:
  - Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
  ans:
  - You're back.

- que:
  - Basquiat, what did you take?
  ans:
  - Basquiat, don't lie. This is smack.

- que:
  - You want some?
  ans:
  - I hadn't thought about it.

- que:
  - Think so?
  ans:
  - ... babies.

- que:
  - What's wrong with me?
  ans:
  - You're your own baby.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - A present I picked up for you.

- que:
  - Don't you think he's using you?
  ans:
  - Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
  ans:
  - That is amazing. What year is it?

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.

- que:
  - Is that the best quality you have?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's the best one.

- que:
  - Me? Why?
  ans:
  - You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.

  - Would you check out my studio some time?
  ans:
  - Sure. I'd be glad to.

- que:
  - What's your name, man?
  ans:

- que:
  - That's ignorant.
  ans:
  - Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?

- que:
  - Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
  ans:
  - No, nothing, ah ... His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.

- que:
  - Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right?
  ans:
  - I suppose you feel better now, sir.

- que:
  - Mr. Wayne ... a reminder, Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck. May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
  ans:
  - I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...

- que:
  - Ah. \"Who\", may I ask, are you going \"as\"?
  ans:
  - Hanging on every word.

- que:
  - Good joke. Wanna hear another one?
  ans:
  - A \"he-man\"? Sure. They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.

- que:
  - Admiring your handiwork?
  ans:
  - Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.

- que:
  - Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
  ans:
  - Things change.

- que:
  - Have we?
  ans:
  - Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.

- que:
  - Didn't I say that?
  ans:
  - Yes and no ...

- que:
  - \"We\"? You and...
  ans:

  ans:
  - Yes and no...

- que:
  - I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
  ans:
  - Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.

- que:
  - Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Had one. Didn't work.

- que:
  - \"Vicki.\" Ice-skater, or stewardess?
  ans:
  - Photojournalist.

- que:
  - Well? Was \"Vicki\" right? About your difficulty with duality?
  ans:
  - If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.

- que:
  - S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
  ans:
  - What're you doing three dates from now?

- que:
  - No hard feelings?
  ans:
  - There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding. What say we ...

- que:
  - Y'mean take off our costumes?
  ans:
  - Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...

- que:
  - Same here. So why'd you come tonight?
  ans:

- que:
  - Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge or?
  ans:
  - I don't know anymore, Bruce ...

- que:
  - ... What do we do?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.

- que:
  - Weird, huh?
  ans:
  - Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.

- que:
  - I am the light of this city. And I am its mean, twisted soul. Does it really matter who's the \"mayor\"?
  ans:
  - It does to me.

- que:
  - Selina! Selina Kyle!? You're fired! And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
  ans:
  - He is Batman, you moron.

- que:
  - Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we've got something in common.
  ans:
  - You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me. Three lives down. Got enough bullets to finish me off?

- que:
  - Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
  ans:
  - Batman. The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.

- que:
  - Huh? You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
  ans:
  - Are you perchance a registered voter? I'm also a mayoral prospect.

- que:
  - Y'mean frame him?
  ans:
  - You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot.

- que:
  - Yes. Yes. Boyfriend trouble ..?
  ans:
  - PMS.

- que:
  - You buy this \"blurry\" business?
  ans:
  - No, just give you a splitting headache.

- que:
  - And exactly why?
  ans:
  - Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere.

- que:
  - What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
  ans:
  - If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.

- que:
  - Don't look, Oswald. It's a surprise.
  ans:
  - A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?

- que:
  - A big bag of fan mail? Filthy lucre? Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
  ans:
  - Wonder if it's worth my time.

- que:
  - Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
  ans:
  - Imagine, You'll have the ear of the media. Access to captains of industry. Unlimited poon- tang ...

- que:
  - And a very, very good one.
  ans:
  - And who ... would you say this to?

- que:
  - It's our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
  ans:
  - I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle. And Interest Number One, is moi.

- que:
  - Actually I have to split. Take a \"personal day.\" You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
  ans:
  - Morning, Max. Bummer about the store. You insured?

- que:
  - How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
  ans:
  - Ten years. Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.

- que:
  - Too late for what, dear child?
  ans:
  - I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.

- que:
  - Uncle Alfred?
  ans:
  - In spirit only, I'm afraid.

- que:
  - Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Well, I hope you'll stay with us.

- que:
  - But I can't can I?
  ans:
  - No, my boy. I'm afraid none of us can.

- que:
  - Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
  ans:
  - Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.

- que:
  - I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death. What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
  ans:
  - Everyone dies, Master Bruce. There's no defeat in that. Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.

- que:
  - What seems to be the problem?
  ans:
  - Women.

- que:
  - Pheromones?
  ans:
  - Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions. Fear. Rage...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.

- que:
  - Alfred, are you...?
  ans:
  - My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago. Alfred has been supporting me ever since.

- que:
  - Hey, what's your problem?
  ans:
  - I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich. Even when they try to act like heroes.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Alfred and Bruce are like family.

- que:
  - Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
  ans:
  - Alfred's happy here.

- que:
  - Alpha. Got it. What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
  ans:
  - Divide and conquer.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It just feels right.

- que:
  - Nice suit. And today you are?
  ans:
  - Nightwing. Scourge of darkest evil.

- que:
  - This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It's the gear. Chicks love the gear.

- que:
  - You think Freeze will take the bait?
  ans:
  - He'll be here.

- que:
  - How did you...?
  ans:
  - Open Sesame...Chicken.

- que:
  - Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
  ans:
  - Can he save her?

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.

- que:
  - What can I do for you, Doctor? A research grant? A hospital wing?
  ans:
  - Actually, I already work for you. Or did. Your arboreal preservation project in South America.

- que:
  - That lab was consumed by fire last week. how did you manage to escape?
  ans:
  - I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.

- que:
  - Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
  ans:
  - Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend. Thank you all. Good day, Doctor.

- que:
  - Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
  ans:
  - I can't. But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.

- que:
  - No!?
  ans:
  - Umm. What I mean is...no plans at the moment...

- que:
  - Can I get some help over here?
  ans:
  - You're not even listening to me.

- que:
  - You just called me Ivy. Who's Ivy?
  ans:
  - I wish I knew.

- que:
  - Bruce? What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Make a choice, Bruce. Her or me.

- que:
  - What happened to his wife?
  ans:
  - Presumed dead. No one knows.

- que:
  - We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.

- que:
  - I got the diamond. Quell problemo, Bruce?
  ans:
  - You left your back wide open. Freeze could have killed you.

- que:
  - Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
  ans:
  - She wants to kill you.

- que:
  - Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's. But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
  ans:
  - Impressive

- que:
  - An enticing offer. But what does the lady want in return?
  ans:
  - Let's cool it for now. There's someone I want you to meet.

- que:
  - I love that belt. What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
  ans:
  - I always go a size smaller. Makes me look slimmer.

- que:
  - I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
  ans:
  - Make yourself right at home.

- que:
  - Where is my wife?
  ans:
  - There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead.

- que:
  - Kill them. Of course. But why stop there? Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
  ans:
  - Adam and Evil.

- que:
  - Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
  ans:
  - Inspired, Ms. Ivy.

- que:
  - HAVEN What say we turn up the heat?
  ans:
  - I'm glad you came. I can't breathe without you.

- que:
  - How about dangerous curves?
  ans:
  - Of trust. Tell me your plan.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal. These lips can be murder.

- que:
  - Then you never loved me?
  ans:
  - You're too late. Say bye-bye birdie.

- que:
  - What exactly are you working on in there? What are those screams?
  ans:
  - Without your research, I could never have come this far. Join me. The two of us, entwined, side by side...

- que:
  - The dreams again, sir?
  ans:
  - I think they're getting worse.

- que:
  - ...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
  ans:
  - Then you'd have nothing to complain about.

- que:
  - How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
  ans:
  - A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.

- que:
  - Scholarly research?
  ans:
  - She has an excellent mind.

- que:
  - Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
  ans:
  - Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.

- que:
  - Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
  ans:
  - Ninety-three, including the sauna.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.

- que:
  - Is he all right?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.

- que:
  - He ran away?
  ans:
  - Actually, he took the car.

- que:
  - He boosted the Jag? Is that all?
  ans:
  - Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.

- que:
  - Maybe they're right.
  ans:
  - The _Rolls_?

- que:
  - Which `they' might that be, sir?
  ans:
  - Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.

- que:
  - Why, indeed?
  ans:
  - Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...

- que:
  - How are you feeling, young man?
  ans:
  - Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.

- que:
  - Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
  ans:
  - As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - ...Afraid.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred.

- que:
  - Master, Bruce?
  ans:
  - ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.

- que:
  - What do maniacs always want?
  ans:
  - Recognition, of course.

- que:
  - And another name for Mystery?
  ans:
  - Enigma.

- que:
  - Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase. Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
  ans:
  - All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.

- que:
  - How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
  ans:
  - Master Wayne's dead wives.

- que:
  - And you are?
  ans:
  - ...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.

- que:
  - I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
  ans:
  - He's home. I sent the signal.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...

- que:
  - Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
  ans:
  - A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.

- que:
  - My life's an open book. You read?
  ans:
  - I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.

- que:
  - You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
  ans:
  - I haven't had much luck with women...

- que:
  - Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
  ans:
  - No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.

- que:
  - I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
  ans:
  - Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.

- que:
  - Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.

- que:
  - Banzai.
  ans:
  - Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?

- que:
  - I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
  ans:
  - Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.

- que:
  - How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
  ans:
  - Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.

- que:
  - Psychiatrists make you nervous?
  ans:
  - Just ones this beautiful.

- que:
  - The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
  ans:
  - On occasion. Usually at night.

- que:
  - She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams. Need one?
  ans:
  - Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.

- que:
  - So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - What do you know about obsession?
  ans:
  - Not much.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Who are you?
  ans:
  - Like normal folks.

- que:
  - What? This isn't normal?
  ans:
  - That kid is amazing.

- que:
  - The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.

- que:
  - Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
  ans:
  - Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I said I'm sure he did.

- que:
  - Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
  ans:
  - And now....

- que:
  - Why do I feel like the other man, here?
  ans:
  - Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.

- que:
  - So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
  ans:
  - Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.

- que:
  - Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman. Can I?
  ans:
  - And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.

- que:
  - Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
  ans:
  - Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.

- que:
  - What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
  ans:
  - I don't-.

- que:
  - Back off, man.
  ans:
  - What are you talking about?

- que:
  - But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
  ans:
  - What the hell did you think you were doing?

- que:
  - And when you finally get Two-Face?
  ans:
  - Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me. All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.

- que:
  - Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be. What do you think of my new invention?
  ans:
  - Edward...

- que:
  - How could I forget?
  ans:
  - Can't tell if you don't say please.

- que:
  - Paranoid? The psychotic?
  ans:
  - ...The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike.

- que:
  - Fred?
  ans:
  - I'll show you it works.

- que:
  - What the hell is going on here?
  ans:
  - ...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!

- que:
  - ...You gonna kill me?
  ans:
  - Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.

- que:
  - What say we flip for it?
  ans:
  - ...or death.

- que:
  - That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.

- que:
  - How'd you find us?
  ans:
  - Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.

- que:
  - Where are you sending Batboy this time?
  ans:
  - Here. Get a good seat.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Everything.

- que:
  - How high up would you say that is?
  ans:
  - I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

- que:
  - Which bathroom is that, sir?
  ans:
  - The small one.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.

- que:
  - Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
  ans:
  - Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his regrets.

- que:
  - Where's the boy?
  ans:
  - Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... ... You made me what I am today.

- que:
  - How do I know you won't keep them all?
  ans:
  - I'll take you with me.

- que:
  - ... How long have I been out?
  ans:
  - Quite a while. I took the scenic route.

- que:
  - What is this stuff? Kevlar?
  ans:
  - Better. It's not on the market yet.

- que:
  - How'd you find this place?
  ans:
  - Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Photo database. I'll do your photos now.

- que:
  - I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost. Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
  ans:
  - I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.

- que:
  - Is this what you wanted?
  ans:
  - You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.

- que:
  - What is it you want?
  ans:
  - I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.

- que:
  - Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
  ans:
  - Because I... ... Because she'd never speak to me again.

- que:
  - Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
  ans:
  - Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.

- que:
  - I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
  ans:
  - As far as I know.

- que:
  - Do you sail?
  ans:
  - Too much work. I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.

- que:
  - That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What did you see?
  ans:
  - ... Terror.

- que:
  - ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
  ans:
  - I know it's late. I -- Are you there?

- que:
  - So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - No one would miss me.

- que:
  - What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
  ans:
  - Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.

- que:
  - How can you do that if she's already off the line?
  ans:
  - Hang on. I have to leave a message.

- que:
  - In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
  ans:
  - I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.

- que:
  - Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
  ans:
  - We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.

- que:
  - All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.

- que:
  - Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.
  ans:
  - What are you talking about?

- que:
  - Very good idea, Jack. In fact -- -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
  ans:
  - What are you, scared of heights?

- que:
  - Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
  ans:
  - Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

- que:
  - And what happens if we say no?
  ans:
  - Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
  ans:
  - Joker here. Can we talk?

- que:
  - ... Behind the makeup?
  ans:
  - I've seen worse. Much worse.

- que:
  - ... Why the mask?
  ans:
  - Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.

- que:
  - Too much glamor, huh. What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo? Apes in Kenya?
  ans:
  - God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.

- que:
  - A girl could get killed - - so they tell me. What's new and hot in Gotham City?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's too good. We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.

- que:
  - Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
  ans:
  - Small so far. I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.

- que:
  - Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser. Did you get your invitation yet?
  ans:
  - Oh, absolutely. Bruce and I are very close.

- que:
  - Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people?
  ans:
  - Some. I am a rich bitch, remember? I'm quoting.

- que:
  - Where does one man get all this junk?
  ans:
  - All aver the world. They say he's spent half of his life overseas.

- que:
  - What were you thinking?
  ans:
  - Yum, yum.

- que:
  - Peanuts?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through women.

- que:
  - Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
  ans:
  - You are on drugs.

- que:
  - Are they paying you for all this?
  ans:
  - Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.

- que:
  - ... Oh? Why is that, Vicki?
  ans:
  - He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know.

- que:
  - Not what?
  ans:
  - He's not crazy.

- que:
  - Jesus, Vicki! Where is it?
  ans:
  - It's gone.

- que:
  - Yeeees?
  ans:
  - And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.

- que:
  - There aren't hotels?
  ans:
  - Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.

- que:
  - And what did you say?
  ans:
  - I said I'd check with you.

- que:
  - David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes. Sometime.

- que:
  - Tom Jones?
  ans:
  - Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...

- que:
  - Did you really ask?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

- que:
  - Ali? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Your face smells like a foot.

- que:
  - Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
  ans:
  - Hi,

- que:
  - Great. You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?
  ans:
  - Sort of half.....

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

- que:
  - Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
  ans:
  - Let's get a coffee.

- que:
  - It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?
  ans:
  - I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.

- que:
  - He doesn't like to say much does he?
  ans:
  - Right first time.

- que:
  - Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
  ans:
  - Ahm.....

- que:
  - What? What?
  ans:
  - Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh Jesus God. Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.

- que:
  - Howls he getting on with the family?
  ans:
  - Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great.

- que:
  - And howls Alison?
  ans:
  - She's ... well, she's good.

- que:
  - Isn't it?
  ans:
  - Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.

- que:
  - Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
  ans:
  - Not necessarily. That's where this ... comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough.

- que:
  - Everything okay, David?
  ans:
  - Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.

- que:
  - David?
  ans:
  - We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the Governor.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.

- que:
  - Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
  ans:
  - Tomorrow. You have a problem with that?

- que:
  - Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
  ans:
  - You're not going to ....

- que:
  - Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean?
  ans:
  - ... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.

- que:
  - Well, congratulations. Isn't that great, David?
  ans:
  - Certainly is.

- que:
  - I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
  ans:
  - VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - Richard Burton was very good-looking.

- que:
  - Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
  ans:
  - It's you and Mom that need to talk.

- que:
  - You arrange those flowers yourself?
  ans:
  - Sure did.

- que:
  - They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
  ans:
  - No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

- que:
  - I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
  ans:
  - Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember, any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.

- que:
  - Is Jenny gonna be okay?
  ans:
  - She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.

- que:
  - Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
  ans:
  - We'll get you whatever you want. Get that other kid. We might need him.

- que:
  - Ah, the witness?
  ans:
  - Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.

- que:
  - You see what I see, Bork?
  ans:
  - I see it. I don't get it.

- que:
  - Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
  ans:
  - Well, sir it's not good. Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...

- que:
  - Cavity search...?
  ans:
  - Deep and hard.

- que:
  - Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
  ans:
  - Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.

- que:
  - That's better. Yes?
  ans:
  - We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.

- que:
  - What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
  ans:
  - D.C., Chief.

- que:
  - Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
  ans:
  - Uh, Butt-Head.

- que:
  - That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
  ans:
  - Whoa, huh huh. Cool.

- que:
  - Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
  ans:
  - She sure does.

- que:
  - This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
  ans:
  - Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.

- que:
  - You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
  ans:
  - Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.

- que:
  - Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
  ans:
  - Uh, ten uh...

- que:
  - Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it. You've finished the streets?
  ans:
  - Almost.

- que:
  - Manchurian Tung oil? Where did you get it?
  ans:
  - Helen got it for me in Oslo.

- que:
  - How's your arm?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. It feels... frozen.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's how long you were gone.

- que:
  - Anything happen while I was away?
  ans:
  - Yes it did. Yes it did. I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.

- que:
  - Cabin fever, hon?
  ans:
  - Maybe this is heaven.

- que:
  - She can't see you, right? In the book, Rule Number Two, the living usually won't see the dead.
  ans:
  - But I'm not hungry, are you?

- que:
  - They make gypsies look good.
  ans:
  - Won't? Or can't?

- que:
  - Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do?
  ans:
  - I don't know if there's anything we can do.

- que:
  - That's it? No number, or instructions?
  ans:
  - Nothing. The bio buster? I don't get it...

- que:
  - What about this Beetle guy?
  ans:
  - We don't know who he is... ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.

- que:
  - Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone.
  ans:
  - I don't know... what are you looking up?

- que:
  - How long do you suppose we were waiting?
  ans:
  - We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here. Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.

- que:
  - God, this is so corny. Have we been reduced to this? Sheets?
  ans:
  - Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really moan! Practice, practice, practice.

- que:
  - Where are your skulls and bones?
  ans:
  - You know you're really a pretty girl.

- que:
  - Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
  ans:
  - Three times. Powerful number.

- que:
  - Maybe we should knock first?
  ans:
  - She's only fourteen...

- que:
  - The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
  ans:
  - N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.

- que:
  - Who did the sushi?
  ans:
  - Maybe they'll leave now. That snake was a pretty nasty customer.

- que:
  - You know, I've been thinking. I could teach Lydia to sew.
  ans:
  - Adam! Why did you build a whorehouse? Have you ever been to...?

- que:
  - Little black party dresses?
  ans:
  - Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls. She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - Just a hunch.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - 3,30 I guess.

- que:
  - A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
  ans:
  - We're ghosts.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Night of the Living Dead? It's this gross movie.

- que:
  - Is this like a trick question?
  ans:
  - Nobody else can.

- que:
  - Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
  ans:
  - We were trying to scare your mother.

- que:
  - You did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
  ans:
  - I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.

- que:
  - And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody?
  ans:
  - We want to frighten you away. So that you'll move out.

- que:
  - You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't you leave?
  ans:
  - We weren't there. The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.

- que:
  - God, if this is true this is like, amazing! I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
  ans:
  - You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.

- que:
  - What is going on?
  ans:
  - Really. I don't know.

- que:
  - Did you get the paint?
  ans:
  - W... We didn't know how to make one.

- que:
  - Nine months? What difference does that make?
  ans:
  - Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.

- que:
  - Wait for who?
  ans:
  - For Juno, your caseworker. Not that it matters to your type. But there are all these other people here ahead of you. I'd say three hours.

- que:
  - Hell no! I'm rolling. I'm a businessman. I'm the man what am do I gotta kill?
  ans:
  - You don't kill anyone.

- que:
  - Can you scare them off?
  ans:
  - We tried.

- que:
  - Handbook? When...?
  ans:
  - Out.

- que:
  - All right. Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'd nearly given up on you. I was about to leave. I do have other clients.

- que:
  - Are you Juno, our case worker?
  ans:
  - Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.

- que:
  - -- Like you used to be?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Our cemetery?
  ans:
  - The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture! We've got some serious talking to do.

- que:
  - What about Betelgeuse?
  ans:
  - Forget him. He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him. You need to worry about people like Otho.

- que:
  - You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
  ans:
  - We're practicing.

- que:
  - Funeral. God, you guys really are! What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry?
  ans:
  - I don't wear that stuff to bed wrong with it. I'm getting out of here.

- que:
  - No you don't! No... Lydia... Why?
  ans:
  - Life is just... too awful.

- que:
  - How'd you do on the science test?
  ans:
  - It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way. I said it was against my religion. I got a C.

- que:
  - And live in what, our station wagon?
  ans:
  - Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family.

- que:
  - Are you a spirit too?
  ans:
  - Sort of. High spirit. Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years. All I want is to get out.

- que:
  - You do? Over here? On my side?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - That's right. They treat you like scum I bet?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Minor problem. The rules. I can't tell it to you. But... do you know how to play charades?
  ans:
  - You've got to help them.

- que:
  - Can you help me?
  ans:
  - ... I will.

- que:
  - W... What is it?
  ans:
  - W... What is it?

- que:
  - He's your cousin.
  ans:
  - Your qu...? But you're...

- que:
  - What's he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment?
  ans:
  - Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Delia hates it.

- que:
  - Where is your mother?
  ans:
  - Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm lonely.

- que:
  - Answer your mother.
  ans:
  - Dad. Do you believe me?

- que:
  - Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
  ans:
  - They're... not here anymore.

- que:
  - Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles. You relax up there, ya hear?
  ans:
  - I don't care from guilt. I just want to see them.

- que:
  - Are they suffering?
  ans:
  - They're already dead. They can't feel a thing.

- que:
  - This is our first meal in this house, Lydia. Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
  ans:
  - I say let's keep it the way it is.

- que:
  - Any particular kind?
  ans:
  - Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand.

- que:
  - The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started?
  ans:
  - No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I thought I saw something.

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - That's Charles' study. But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it. He's such a sheep.

- que:
  - You don't have a key?
  ans:
  - Maybe Charles does.

- que:
  - Are they still here, Otho?
  ans:
  - Oh, they're still here. They're Just not showing up.

- que:
  - What's happening to them?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I'm going to live at home.

- que:
  - It's okay. How's the dirt business?
  ans:
  - Well, I just placed a call to your mother. She had stepped out but I have some news for her.

- que:
  - All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak. Where do they hide out?
  ans:
  - The attic.

- que:
  - Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
  ans:
  - Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.

- que:
  - Thomas? Who's Thomas?
  ans:
  - Thomas Franklin, an attorney.

- que:
  - An attorney?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
  ans:
  - There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.

- que:
  - Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
  ans:
  - It's fine today, Robert.

- que:
  - ... Were you going somewhere?
  ans:
  - No, Robert.

- que:
  - ... Oh? You've heard?
  ans:
  - Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.

- que:
  - He does, does he?
  ans:
  - Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.

- que:
  - How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
  ans:
  - ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.

- que:
  - Oh, really?
  ans:
  - ... He's gone, Chauncey.

- que:
  - Will you be leaving now, Robert?
  ans:
  - In a day or two, yes.

- que:
  - ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... ... Chance...?
  ans:
  - Yes. I love Eve very much.

- que:
  - I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.

- que:
  - Stay here? Is that necessary?
  ans:
  - Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.

- que:
  - He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
  ans:
  - At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.

- que:
  - Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
  ans:
  - No, Eve... I'm sorry.

- que:
  - ... But he's...?
  ans:
  - He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...

- que:
  - ... Do you think we should look for him?
  ans:
  - I have no idea...

- que:
  - Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
  ans:
  - Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.

- que:
  - Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
  ans:
  - I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.

- que:
  - And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
  ans:
  - Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.

- que:
  - Do you know Raphael?
  ans:
  - No sir, I don't believe I do.

- que:
  - Would you care to take it, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
  ans:
  - It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.

- que:
  - Your family doctor?
  ans:
  - I agree.

- que:
  - Would you care for a drink?
  ans:
  - Yes. Thank you.

- que:
  - May I ask your name?
  ans:
  - My name is Chance.

- que:
  - Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
  ans:
  - No. I'm a gardener.

- que:
  - Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
  ans:
  - No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.

- que:
  - Did you lose something?
  ans:
  - Yes. I lost my remote control.

- que:
  - Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
  ans:
  - No. It won't do that.

- que:
  - ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
  ans:
  - No. The Old Man died and Louise left.

- que:
  - Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
  ans:
  - ... Why... No, I don't think so...

- que:
  - Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?
  ans:
  - Fine. He's very nice.

- que:
  - Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
  ans:
  - He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.

- que:
  - ... Mentor...?
  ans:
  - Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.

- que:
  - I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
  ans:
  - Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Our greenhouse.

- que:
  - How is Ben feeling?
  ans:
  - He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.

- que:
  - ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
  ans:
  - No, Eve. I don't read the papers.

- que:
  - I know... ... So are you, Chauncey ... ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
  ans:
  - No, Eve. I like you to be here.

- que:
  - ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be... I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
  ans:
  - Yes, Eve. I know that.

- que:
  - To watch...? To watch me...?
  ans:
  - Yes. I like to watch.

- que:
  - ... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's very good, Eve.

- que:
  - ... But I've never done... ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
  ans:
  - That's very interesting, Eve.

- que:
  - Can you see well?
  ans:
  - Yes, very well, thank you.

- que:
  - Do you like it?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.

- que:
  - ... Are you sure you like it?
  ans:
  - Yes, I do, it's very good.

- que:
  - How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
  ans:
  - Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.

- que:
  - To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
  ans:
  - Yes, I understand.

- que:
  - I agree.
  ans:
  - Do you think so? Do you think so?

- que:
  - ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
  ans:
  - Yes. I am very hungry.

- que:
  - Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
  ans:
  - Yes. Chauncey is fine.

- que:
  - Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
  ans:
  - Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.

- que:
  - He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Yes, Ben - he is.

- que:
  - Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
  ans:
  - ... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...

- que:
  - Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
  ans:
  - Yes. I like to watch very much.

- que:
  - Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
  ans:
  - Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.

- que:
  - ... Sir?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - ... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes, I would like to see Ben.

- que:
  - ... Then you really are a gardener?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What about money?
  ans:
  - I never needed money.

- que:
  - Some pictures...?
  ans:
  - Yes. Of men and women.

- que:
  - How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
  ans:
  - No. That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

- que:
  - Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
  ans:
  - It's very sore.

- que:
  - Let's have a look, do you mind?
  ans:
  - Of course. I would like to look.

- que:
  - It's starting to swell, is it painful?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
  ans:
  - ... Yes. You can take me.

- que:
  - Does it have a television?
  ans:
  - No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.

- que:
  - How long do we stay in here?
  ans:
  - How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...

- que:
  - Is his back feeling better?
  ans:
  - Good morning, Louise.

- que:
  - Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess... ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
  ans:
  - I'm going to work in the garden.

- que:
  - Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
  ans:
  - Yes. I was there with Ben.

- que:
  - Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
  ans:
  - Yes. We need a very good gardener.

- que:
  - ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.

- que:
  - Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
  ans:
  - Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.

- que:
  - ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
  ans:
  - I live here.

- que:
  - ... How long have you been living here?
  ans:
  - Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.

- que:
  - Since you were a child?
  ans:
  - Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.

- que:
  - Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How were you paid?
  ans:
  - I was given meals, and a home...

- que:
  - Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
  ans:
  - No, I do not have any of those.

- que:
  - ... Joe? Who's Joe?
  ans:
  - Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.

- que:
  - 1952...?
  ans:
  - Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.

- que:
  - Have you served in the Army?
  ans:
  - No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.

- que:
  - Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
  ans:
  - No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.

- que:
  - ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
  ans:
  - No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.

- que:
  - What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
  ans:
  - I would like to stay and work in my garden.

- que:
  - But you won't sign, correct?
  ans:
  - Correct.

- que:
  - Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
  ans:
  - As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.

- que:
  - ... Spring and summer... Yes, I see... Fall and winter. Yes, indeed... Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
  ans:
  - Yes. It has.

- que:
  - ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
  ans:
  - Yes. I will.

- que:
  - ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
  ans:
  - ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...

- que:
  - Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.

- que:
  - No headaches?
  ans:
  - No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.

- que:
  - You heard?
  ans:
  - I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

- que:
  - Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
  ans:
  - Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.

- que:
  - Do you need a secretary?
  ans:
  - I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached... ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.

- que:
  - Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
  ans:
  - Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...

- que:
  - ... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...

- que:
  - ... Would you take me on a tour?
  ans:
  - Gladly... ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.

- que:
  - ... What do you make of all this?
  ans:
  - We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.

- que:
  - But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
  ans:
  - I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.

- que:
  - So...? Where the hell is it?
  ans:
  - We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
  ans:
  - Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.

  - ... So what does all that add up to?
  ans:
  - I would appreciate that.

- que:
  - Good. Anything else?
  ans:
  - Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.

- que:
  - ... Well?
  ans:
  - Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.

- que:
  - It's that serious, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so.

- que:
  - Say, aren't you that actor guy?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - Who am I thinking of?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Hmmm.

  ans:
  - Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.

  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.

- que:
  - I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
  ans:
  - What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.

- que:
  - How was it?
  ans:
  - I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.

  - Why?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.

- que:
  - I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.

- que:
  - What's that?

- que:
  - You came up here looking for the portal?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.

- que:
  - You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
  ans:
  - I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.

- que:
  - You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
  ans:
  - People make mistakes.

- que:
  - I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?

  - Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
  ans:
  - Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

- que:
  - You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
  ans:
  - Glooph is not a letter, sir.

- que:
  - Just one. Why is this floor so short?
  ans:
  - Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.

- que:
  - I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
  ans:
  - I'll keep that in mind, sir.

- que:
  - I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
  ans:
  - No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...

- que:
  - Is that true?
  ans:
  - Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.

- que:
  - I just wanted to say hi. Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Just.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - You married?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But enough about me.

- que:
  - What'll you have?
  ans:
  - The usual, Barry.

- que:
  - My tits?
  ans:
  - No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...

- que:
  - That's the usual?
  ans:
  - Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.

- que:
  - Don't you want to know what happened to me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
  ans:
  - He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.

  ans:
  - Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

  ans:
  - Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

  - You wanted to be partners with me?
  ans:
  - Sure. It'd be fun.

- que:
  - Are you torturing me on purpose?
  ans:
  - I've fallen in love.

  - Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
  ans:
  - Lotte? Is that you?

- que:
  - What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
  ans:
  - How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.

- que:
  - Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
  ans:
  - Ha ha ha!

- que:
  - Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
  ans:
  - If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...

- que:
  - Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
  ans:
  - No. Don't be an ass.

- que:
  - Can I be anyone I want?
  ans:
  - You can be John Malkovich.

- que:
  - Vegas? What'd you think?
  ans:
  - The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.

- que:
  - A scary dream?
  ans:
  - No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.

- que:
  - How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
  ans:
  - No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.

- que:
  - What kind of circumstances?
  ans:
  - Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.

- que:
  - Do tell. I love a good plan.
  ans:
  - The Great Mantini?

- que:
  - Why are you being like this?
  ans:
  - I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.

- que:
  - Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
  ans:
  - I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.

- que:
  - Gehginnis ondah foam?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - Fork ah did?
  ans:

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - TRUMAN PUPPET It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.

- que:
  - Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
  ans:
  - Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.

- que:
  - You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
  ans:
  - I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.

- que:
  - I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
  ans:
  - All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.

- que:
  - You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
  ans:
  - Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.

- que:
  - Do we get to wear a crown?
  ans:
  - But of course.

- que:
  - Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.

- que:
  - Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
  ans:
  - With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.

- que:
  - But why, Son of Malkovich?
  ans:
  - I blew it, Dr. Lester.

- que:
  - Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
  ans:

  - Did you see the reviews?

- que:
  - What's the play?
  ans:
  - Say... \"Equus\"? It's got everything.

- que:
  - Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
  ans:
  - Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.

- que:
  - Is there dancing?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who's calling?
  ans:
  - You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.

- que:
  - How'd you get this number?
  ans:
  - It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...

- que:
  - Can I get you a drink?
  ans:
  - Whatever you're having.

  - So, do you enjoy being an actor?
  ans:
  - Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

  ans:
  - Lotte called me.

- que:
  - You still there, sweets?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.

- que:
  - You mean with Malkovich?
  ans:
  - Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.

- que:
  - Vegas. Can you arrange that?
  ans:
  - I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.

- que:
  - Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
  ans:
  - He's a selfish bastard.

- que:
  - Bad dream, darling?
  ans:
  - I've got to leave Malkovich.

- que:
  - What want ye, girl child?
  ans:
  - I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.

  - Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.

- que:
  - What do you do for fun?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.

- que:
  - What happened to your house?
  ans:
  - Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.

- que:
  - Finder's fee?
  ans:
  - He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.

- que:
  - It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does?
  ans:
  - Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.

- que:
  - So...that doctor.
  ans:
  - Huh. Jeez. Well, so, did he--is that yoga?

- que:
  - This was a valued, uh.
  ans:
  - Exactly. What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

- que:
  - Forget it, Donny. You're out of your element.
  ans:
  - What's your point, Walter?

- que:
  - This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--

- que:
  - You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - Theodore Herzel.

- que:
  - What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.

- que:
  - This is a league game. This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
  ans:
  - Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.

- que:
  - Anyway. How much they offer you?
  ans:
  - Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.

- que:
  - Just for making the hand-off?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It's your roll.
  ans:
  - Huh?

- que:
  - What the hell is this?
  ans:
  - My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.

- que:
  - Oh shit. Walter.
  ans:
  - Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?

- que:
  - Yeah. So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
  ans:
  - What the fuck is going on there?

- que:
  - Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she?
  ans:
  - That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him.

- que:
  - ...Huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.

- que:
  - Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used to say.
  ans:
  - What'd he say? Where's the hand- off?

- que:
  - That wasn't her toe.
  ans:
  - What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?

- que:
  - They're nihilists.
  ans:
  - Whose toe was it, Walter?

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - They kept saying they believe in nothing.

- que:
  - Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
  ans:
  - Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

- que:
  - I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
  ans:
  - Is this your homework, Larry?

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.

- que:
  - And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
  ans:
  - What's your point, Dude?

- que:
  - Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?
  ans:
  - This driveway.

- que:
  - Dude here.
  ans:
  - AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - Who is this?

- que:
  - So no funny stuff. Okay?
  ans:
  - Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.

- que:
  - Employed?
  ans:
  - You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.

- que:
  - Sure! Fuck it! That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead! Your answer to everything!
  ans:
  - Dude.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I don't know, sir.

- que:
  - Is it... is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?
  ans:
  - Sure. That and a pair of testicles.

- que:
  - Mind if I smoke a jay?
  ans:
  - Bunny.

- que:
  - Bunny Lebowski... She is the light of my life. Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
  ans:
  - No. No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.

- que:
  - Where's the money, Lebowski?
  ans:
  - We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself.

- que:
  - Well? Aren't you?
  ans:
  - Well... yeah.

- que:
  - Smokey Huh?
  ans:
  - Impressive.

- que:
  - Whatta we do about the Mex?
  ans:
  - We'll take 'em in the morning.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Survival.

- que:
  - Where to first?
  ans:
  - The House of Pain.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What about Nomak?
  ans:
  - He escaped. You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.

- que:
  - how long since he was bitten?
  ans:
  - Minutes.

- que:
  - Recognize him?
  ans:
  - From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.

- que:
  - Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
  ans:
  - Time.

- que:
  - Anyone else make it?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.

- que:
  - Why do you hate us so much?
  ans:
  - I am a hunter. A weapon. It's what I do. It's in my blood.

- que:
  - I don't understand.
  ans:
  - Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?

- que:
  - How does it look?
  ans:
  - Not good.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - I want to see the sun rise.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.

- que:
  - Did you think I wouldn't?
  ans:
  - Took you long enough.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Sounds like a plan.

- que:
  - What do you really think?
  ans:
  - These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain. They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.

- que:
  - Where were you, Whistler?
  ans:
  - I'll show you.

- que:
  - What the hell is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Eau de suckhead. Tasty.

- que:
  - Where the hell have you been?
  ans:
  - Just out connecting a few dots.

- que:
  - And so will we.
  ans:
  - Then who does he work for?

- que:
  - Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
  ans:
  - Spare me the race card, OJ. We're not going out into the sun. It's too risky.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - You want me to hunt them for you.

- que:
  - The genetic material you spliced into Nomak -- Where did you get it?
  ans:
  - I should think that would be obvious at this point.

- que:
  - And why is that?
  ans:
  - Revenge. That's what Nomak wanted all along. To pay back the people who created him.

- que:
  - You got something in mind, Blade?
  ans:
  - Ultra-rapid detox. They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - He was here. Watching us.

- que:
  - Nomak?
  ans:
  - He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

- que:
  - So that's down and dirty. Got anything to say for yourself?
  ans:
  - Two things. One, I was on to you the moment they turned you. And two -- I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.

- que:
  - Well you've got it, warmblood. Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah? Like how little? In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.

- que:
  - What the fuck you doing?
  ans:
  - Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing. I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.

- que:
  - Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato. Where did he learn that?
  ans:
  - From his father, of course.

- que:
  - You experimented on your own, son?
  ans:
  - We're locked in.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - They've made contact with the Reapers.

- que:
  - Any casualties?
  ans:
  - Two so far.

- que:
  - I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
  ans:
  - Not that I'm in contact with.

- que:
  - No -- Does that mean I can't be a donor?
  ans:
  - It depends. We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.

- que:
  - Scud.
  ans:
  - Us? What are you talking about?

- que:
  - Whatever -- What'd you do to the Charger?
  ans:
  - Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.

- que:
  - Look, what's your problem?
  ans:
  - Our operation?! Our operation?! I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.

- que:
  - The hell are you fiddling with there?
  ans:
  - Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.

- que:
  - Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
  ans:
  - Nope. Back then we did not.

- que:
  - So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
  ans:
  - Going on twenty years now.

- que:
  - Blade doesn't talk about anything much. What about you, though?
  ans:
  - After last night? Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.

- que:
  - Are we bringing home strays now?
  ans:
  - She's been bitten.

- que:
  - What took you so long?
  ans:
  - Don't even start, old man.

- que:
  - I know. Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
  ans:
  - Going somewhere?

- que:
  - How can you be out here?
  ans:
  - Take him.

- que:
  - This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
  ans:
  - Is something wrong, my friend?

- que:
  - Who is LaMagra?
  ans:
  - The vampire God. This speaks of His return.

- que:
  - How do I stop it?
  ans:
  - Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.

- que:
  - And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
  ans:
  - I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --

- que:
  - How did you know?
  ans:
  - Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.

- que:
  - And that's a good thing?
  ans:
  - For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.

- que:
  - I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
  ans:
  - What are you looking at?

- que:
  - There are worse things than vampires out there.
  ans:
  - How can you tell?

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like me.

- que:
  - Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
  ans:
  - What is this place?

- que:
  - What am I injecting you with?
  ans:
  - Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.

- que:
  - Is he sick?
  ans:
  - Cancer.

- que:
  - You care about him, don't you?
  ans:
  - We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.

- que:
  - You make it sound like I'm already dead.
  ans:
  - Any progress?

- que:
  - Is it bad?
  ans:
  - We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.

- que:
  - Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
  ans:
  - What are you talking about?

- que:
  - How's it going, Kam?
  ans:
  - You're a week early.

- que:
  - How could you be a part of this?
  ans:
  - These are my people now. I'm one of them.

- que:
  - I don't know -- Look at this blood smear --
  ans:
  - Then what is it?

- que:
  - What about the chemistry panel?
  ans:
  - Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.

- que:
  - I thought you promised to give me some distance?
  ans:
  - This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.

- que:
  - You haven't started in on the internal organs?
  ans:
  - Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.

- que:
  - What happens then?
  ans:
  - LaMagra --

- que:
  - Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
  ans:
  - Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?

- que:
  - So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
  ans:
  - We keep in radio contact.

- que:
  - You've been listening in the whole time?
  ans:
  - We weren't sure we could trust you.

- que:
  - Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
  ans:
  - What happens if he doesn't take the serum?

- que:
  - Why do you hunt them?
  ans:
  - I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live. Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.

- que:
  - Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.

- que:
  - All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
  ans:
  - Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.

- que:
  - Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
  ans:
  - Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.

- que:
  - What happened to the power?
  ans:
  - Because it means the tree is older than the house.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - A coward too. That's why she had to go.

- que:
  - My eye, is there something in my eye?
  ans:
  - Not that I can see.

- que:
  - --my God, Nick?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What're you doing there?
  ans:
  - Trying to find the energy.

- que:
  - Inside the grave?
  ans:
  - To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.

- que:
  - I just wanna go home.
  ans:
  - Sometimes. Where are we going?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.

- que:
  - Why are we here?
  ans:
  - She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.

- que:
  - What's she look like?
  ans:
  - No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.

- que:
  - --how old?
  ans:
  - I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.

- que:
  - Druid Hill Park.
  ans:
  - Oak?

- que:
  - That's a joke?
  ans:
  - That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.

- que:
  - Your parents didn't have a bigger one?
  ans:
  - It was free--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.

- que:
  - Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
  ans:
  - You feel no need to get married or anything.

- que:
  - I don't know.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Baby names?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Nightmare.

- que:
  - You want me to scooch over next to you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - We've looked at half of one tape.
  ans:
  - And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?

- que:
  - For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a chance?
  ans:
  - Sleep.

- que:
  - Just now?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What'd you dream?
  ans:
  - Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.

- que:
  - Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - This is what you wanted enhanced?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You mind me asking, why the fuck?
  ans:
  - The, uh, blur there.

- que:
  - You want a hand?
  ans:
  - I want amphetamines.

- que:
  - Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet.

- que:
  - What? That made her lose the baby?
  ans:
  - Something. Someone.

- que:
  - Does it hurt?
  ans:
  - Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.

- que:
  - Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
  ans:
  - I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.

- que:
  - Can't you like just divine it?
  ans:
  - So lemme see it.

- que:
  - From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
  ans:
  - Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.

- que:
  - Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
  ans:
  - Nice tent.

- que:
  - So where the hell am I going to sleep?
  ans:
  - If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.

- que:
  - What movies?
  ans:
  - Ask me what I don't have.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Three people, two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - No fucking.

- que:
  - Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
  ans:
  - What're you, crazy?

- que:
  - What about night?
  ans:
  - Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Get inside quick, they'll stop.

- que:
  - Too busy eating us?
  ans:
  - Just go.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - My room, asleep, last I checked.

- que:
  - Fire escape?
  ans:
  - Don't have one.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - --I don't know.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Doesn't say--it's just these pages.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The wheel.

- que:
  - Cotter?
  ans:
  - I'm not finished.

- que:
  - You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - This isn't about us.

- que:
  - Was it every day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
  ans:
  - Now you can bring the vehicle to a stop, there on the left.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look over there.

- que:
  - How're the cameras doing?
  ans:
  - Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.

- que:
  - --I dunno, I just woke up--
  ans:
  - Spite.

- que:
  - Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
  ans:
  - Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?

- que:
  - It's not a real \"funny\" time for us, okay?
  ans:
  - Well, she's got to be somewhere here.

- que:
  - How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
  ans:
  - Enough to keep sane.

- que:
  - Chrissake, why any of this?
  ans:
  - One of the printers.

- que:
  - Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
  ans:
  - Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.

- que:
  - Oooh. Oooh.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - You planning on sleeping out there?
  ans:
  - Not planning on sleeping at all.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Why she kills children.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.

- que:
  - What'd you see?
  ans:
  - Motion. Stop there. Play it again.

- que:
  - For a blur?
  ans:
  - There is something there--don't ask, just trust me.

- que:
  - What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
  ans:
  - Still working on it.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - ....I don't know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's the reason.

- que:
  - It touched me, don't you see it now?
  ans:
  - Sure. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - What're you afraid's going to happen?
  ans:
  - That they'll start touching us inside our heads.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Domini's the only logical explanation.

- que:
  - Does she, goddamnit?
  ans:
  - His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.

- que:
  - She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
  ans:
  - ....Ma'am?

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Your mother's pastor.

- que:
  - What happened to my Dad?
  ans:
  - There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.

- que:
  - It won't?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Meurice.

- que:
  - What?! Did Ray tell you that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Your husband.

- que:
  - Why d'you wanna leave all this?
  ans:
  - You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...

- que:
  - ...Drive me to a motel?
  ans:
  - You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.

- que:
  - Where... where you going?
  ans:
  - See a guy.

- que:
  - On the phone. Was it for you?
  ans:
  - I don't know, he didn't say anything.

- que:
  - You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
  ans:
  - ...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.

- que:
  - If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
  ans:
  - Well... the couch would be all right...

- que:
  - ...Huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...

- que:
  - Yeah? What happened?
  ans:
  - Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.

- que:
  - ...You ever get tired?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.

- que:
  - Ray?... What time is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's early... I love you.

- que:
  - ...You all right?
  ans:
  - You're bad.

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - I said you're bad.

- que:
  - I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - What happened?--Was Meurice there?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well... what happened?
  ans:
  - I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...

- que:
  - What the hell happened, Ray?
  ans:
  - ...That's what's important.

- que:
  - ...Who?
  ans:
  - Marty.

- que:
  - ...What's going on with you two?
  ans:
  - All right...

- que:
  - ...Where is everything?
  ans:
  - In the trunk.

- que:
  - Isn't that what you want?
  ans:
  - ...But first I gotta know what happened.

- que:
  - What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...

- que:
  - ...So?
  ans:
  - I think someone's watching.

- que:
  - If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
  ans:
  - Remy.

- que:
  - Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
  ans:
  - I don't follow baseball.

- que:
  - So how long have you know Meurice?
  ans:
  - About ten years.

- que:
  - ...So what're you doing tonight?
  ans:
  - I own the place.

- que:
  - And how many room got TV, Dusty?
  ans:
  - Ever durned one.

- que:
  - Lubbock?
  ans:
  - ...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.

- que:
  - ...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
  ans:
  - Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...

- que:
  - I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
  ans:
  - I told you. I like you.

- que:
  - ...You know that car?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...

- que:
  - Back where?
  ans:
  - Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.

- que:
  - Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
  ans:
  - I don't particularly want to talk to you.

- que:
  - Then what'd you come here for?
  ans:
  - What do you mean...

- que:
  - You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.

- que:
  - How long did you watch her?
  ans:
  - Most of the night...

- que:
  - ...Anything else?
  ans:
  - Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.

- que:
  - ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
  ans:
  - Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - You're an idiot.

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.

- que:
  - Ya catch any fish?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Listen, what is it? Is it done?
  ans:
  - Just the ten thousand'll be fine.

- que:
  - Dead, huh?
  ans:
  - So it would seem.

- que:
  - ...What did you do with the bodies?
  ans:
  - It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.

- que:
  - Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Nobody knows you hired me?
  ans:
  - ...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.

- que:
  - Right.
  ans:
  - Has Ray come in yet?

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - What.

- que:
  - What's the point?
  ans:
  - The point is we don't serve niggers here.

- que:
  - ...I thought you were dead. Going home?
  ans:
  - No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.

- que:
  - Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
  ans:
  - Meurice...

- que:
  - Is Marty here?
  ans:
  - Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.

- que:
  - ...Why?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't have taken the money...

- que:
  - Where was I?
  ans:
  - Tuesday.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.

- que:
  - Yeah. How's Dad?
  ans:
  - I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.

- que:
  - Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
  ans:
  - No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

- que:
  - Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm not sick.

- que:
  - Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
  ans:
  - Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
  ans:
  - I've seen a few.

- que:
  - Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
  ans:
  - Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.

- que:
  - Are you Detective Williams?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You did? A human ear?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

- que:
  - These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Anything you can tell me?
  ans:
  - The criminals are winning.

- que:
  - Is that why you say it's horrible?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why do you do it?
  ans:
  - I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.

- que:
  - What is this? What color is it?
  ans:
  - Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

- que:
  - What color is it?
  ans:
  - It's blue. blue velvet.

- que:
  - Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

- que:
  - Is Sandy part of this?
  ans:
  - No. not at all.

- que:
  - Who knows you have these?
  ans:
  - Only you. and the photo lab.

- que:
  - You're all through with this now?
  ans:
  - We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

- que:
  - Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Oh my God. Is her son OK?
  ans:
  - Hello, baby.

- que:
  - Who's this fuck?
  ans:
  - He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.

- que:
  - Where are we going, Frank?
  ans:
  - Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.

- que:
  - You want to see him too, right?
  ans:
  - Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

- que:
  - Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
  ans:
  - Those are my breasts.

- que:
  - Can I feel 'em?
  ans:
  - If you want to.

- que:
  - Frank gone?
  ans:
  - Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.

  ans:
  - I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

- que:
  - Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
  ans:
  - I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.

- que:
  - Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home?
  ans:
  - I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.

- que:
  - What happened to him?

- que:
  - You hungry or thirsty, or both?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I'm here, aren't I?
  ans:
  - I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

- que:
  - What will I say when she comes to the door?
  ans:
  - I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.

- que:
  - Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
  ans:
  - Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

- que:
  - Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
  ans:
  - No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

- que:
  - Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
  ans:
  - I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

- que:
  - You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
  ans:
  - Yes. I do.

- que:
  - You really want to do this, don't you?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

- que:
  - Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.

- que:
  - It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
  ans:
  - Yeah. but.

- que:
  - Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
  ans:
  - O.K.

- que:
  - Oh, okay. can I call?
  ans:
  - Okay. yeah, call.

- que:
  - Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay. thanks.

- que:
  - That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, okay. Bye.

- que:
  - Well, how did it go?. What happened?
  ans:
  - Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

- que:
  - What's with Mike?
  ans:
  - He got a little jealous.

- que:
  - You want a Dairy Queen?
  ans:
  - No way. I'm about to blow up.

- que:
  - Wow. Should you tell my father?
  ans:
  - I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.

- que:
  - Twice. without her sensing anything?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you see her undressed?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.

- que:
  - Who, me? Why should it?
  ans:
  - That's what I thought.

- que:
  - Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
  ans:
  - Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.

- que:
  - I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay. be careful.

- que:
  - Can I give you a kiss good night?
  ans:
  - You better not, Jeffrey.

- que:
  - You want to go talk to him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.

- que:
  - That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
  ans:
  - Shoot.

- que:
  - Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
  ans:
  - Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Jeffrey!!

- que:
  - I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Jeffrey?. Why?
  ans:
  - I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.

- que:
  - You like mysteries that much?
  ans:
  - Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.

- que:
  - You worry about me really?
  ans:
  - Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.

- que:
  - You didn't tell him about me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Just some fatherly advice.

- que:
  - What was that all about?
  ans:
  - Nothing. really! It's good to see you.

- que:
  - Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
  ans:
  - I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.

- que:
  - Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
  ans:
  - I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

- que:
  - You want to dance?
  ans:
  - I can't dance fast.

- que:
  - Really. you want to dance with someone else?
  ans:
  - NO.

- que:
  - You want to dance?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Dorothy Vallens?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Probably not. no. Why?
  ans:

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

- que:
  - Do you want the car?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just gonna walk around.

- que:
  - Can I use the car tonight?
  ans:
  - Of course, Jeffrey.

  - Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'm fine.

- que:
  - Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
  ans:
  - Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

- que:
  - Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

- que:
  - Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - Alright.

- que:
  - Would you like a piece of cake?
  ans:
  - No. No thank you.

- que:
  - Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
  ans:
  - Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

- que:
  - Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
  ans:
  - Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

  - Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.

- que:
  - You happy, baby?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I am.

- que:
  - Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - We'll take it.

- que:
  - You wanna split?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I don't feel so well.

- que:
  - Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
  ans:
  - No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.

- que:
  - What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
  ans:
  - Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.

- que:
  - What? You're not going to wait for me?
  ans:
  - George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.

- que:
  - Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am.

- que:
  - Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
  ans:
  - No, I cam here out of my own volition.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Something about vengance being best served cold.

- que:
  - So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
  ans:
  - Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.

- que:
  - Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
  ans:
  - What? Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - I see. How much?
  ans:
  - Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you.

- que:
  - What can I do for you guys?
  ans:
  - We want some grass.

- que:
  - I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
  ans:
  - I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

- que:
  - What the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - It's your grass.

- que:
  - What can I do for you guys?
  ans:
  - We want some grass.

- que:
  - I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
  ans:
  - I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

- que:
  - What the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - It's your grass.

- que:
  - And I only deal with you?
  ans:
  - Barbara and me. No one else.

- que:
  - Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
  ans:
  - Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.

- que:
  - Sell it?
  ans:
  - Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians.

- que:
  - Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
  ans:
  - It's nothing personal, George. Just business.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - For calling you a homo.

- que:
  - Christ almighty, George. Feed her a cheeseburger or something. What does she weight, eighty pounds?
  ans:
  - I know. She needs to slow down. She's going to blow an O-ring.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Get me a six pack.

- que:
  - Your offense? Why are you here?
  ans:
  - I don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
  ans:
  - Not really, no.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.

- que:
  - What do you got there, Diego?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Just a little project.

- que:
  - What kind of project?
  ans:
  - Never mind. Not for you to worry.

- que:
  - What's the other one?
  ans:
  - I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit.

- que:
  - Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?
  ans:
  - Because I got caught.

- que:
  - Because they caught me?
  ans:
  - You failed because you had the wrong dream.

- que:
  - George? What do you know about cocaine?
  ans:
  - No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty.

- que:
  - What type of planes do you have?
  ans:
  - Four passenger, single engine Cessna.

- que:
  - I don't know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
  ans:
  - Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.

- que:
  - Allo?
  ans:
  - Diego? It's George.

- que:
  - George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm out.

- que:
  - How are we doing?
  ans:
  - Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.

- que:
  - Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you?
  ans:
  - Slow down, George. Slow down.

- que:
  - George, are we gonna do this or not?
  ans:
  - Good to see you, Diego.

- que:
  - What's the matter, George?
  ans:
  - What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.

- que:
  - And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?
  ans:
  - That's my George, always thinking.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
  ans:
  - Just sell it, Derek.

- que:
  - What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.

- que:
  - Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
  ans:
  - Just a friend.

- que:
  - Where do I put this!?
  ans:
  - Try the back bedroom.

- que:
  - Are you comfortable with this?
  ans:
  - And keep only forty-percent? No thanks.

- que:
  - I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George?
  ans:
  - You're a lucky man, Diego.

- que:
  - I love you, my brother, do you know that?
  ans:
  - I love you too, man.

- que:
  - Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough?
  ans:
  - Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.

- que:
  - What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?
  ans:
  - What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.

- que:
  - I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream?
  ans:
  - Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

- que:
  - George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?
  ans:
  - No more brothers, Diego.

- que:
  - He's in tachycardia. George, your heart is racing. Have you been using drugs?
  ans:
  - Coke.

- que:
  - Cocaine? How much?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams.

- que:
  - In how long? A week?
  ans:
  - Today.

- que:
  - Surprised to see me?
  ans:
  - Take your boots off. You're tan.

- que:
  - Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
  ans:
  - You mean the drug money? Yes, I got it.

- que:
  - Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad?
  ans:
  - It's a family heirloom.

- que:
  - Who's the cheapskate?
  ans:
  - You, you big old tightwad. He still has his communion money. Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.

- que:
  - So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
  ans:
  - Actually, it was three.

- que:
  - Un sapo?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.

- que:
  - People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?
  ans:
  - What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.

- que:
  - Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
  ans:
  - I want money.

- que:
  - Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
  ans:
  - Freedom.

- que:
  - Power?
  ans:
  - Yeah, maybe.

- que:
  - Beautiful girls?
  ans:
  - Keep them coming.

- que:
  - And Diego?
  ans:
  - Diego is my brother.

- que:
  - Diego?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're saying life will take care of Diego?
  ans:
  - Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
  ans:
  - Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to California.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to California.

- que:
  - Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
  ans:
  - Tough spot.

- que:
  - You mad at me?
  ans:
  - Not mad.

- que:
  - No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Dad. I'm happy right now.

- que:
  - You're not going to trial?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Give this to Mom, will you?
  ans:
  - Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know. This is it, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Tell Mom, you know...

- que:
  - That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that?
  ans:
  - That was a beautiful message.

- que:
  - What the fuck? Is he going to walk?
  ans:
  - He's going down, George. It's election year. We're not making any deals.

- que:
  - Figured what out?
  ans:
  - You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.

- que:
  - It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
  ans:
  - George.

- que:
  - Figured what out?
  ans:
  - You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.

- que:
  - It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
  ans:
  - George.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you talking about, man?
  ans:
  - The set-up is wrong. We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail. We're getting middled.

- que:
  - Source? What about Derek?
  ans:
  - He's getting middled, too. And Derek's our partner. What's good for us is good for him.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Why are you smiling?
  ans:
  - I don't know. My name is George.

- que:
  - What is your name?
  ans:
  - You better know what you're doing, George. You're playing with fire.

- que:
  - Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
  ans:
  - Put that shit away, they're here.

- que:
  - Pablo said no?
  ans:
  - Look, Mirtha. She's walking.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Out.

- que:
  - Don't touch me. Tell me. Just answer the question. What do I spend? What? How will we live?
  ans:
  - Not in front of the kid.

- que:
  - Hey, why don't you just put a \"I'm doing cocaine\" sign on the car. What is your fucking problem?
  ans:
  - My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You should have taken better care of me, you know? You've been away a long time. Four years. Say something.

- que:
  - You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.

- que:
  - Hey, George. You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good.

- que:
  - Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina?
  ans:
  - Kristina's fine.

- que:
  - Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
  ans:
  - George, he wasn't asking.

- que:
  - Mirtha, how are you doing?
  ans:
  - Better than you.

- que:
  - What's happening to us?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.

- que:
  - How are you doing?
  ans:
  - George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You can call me Dad if you want.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.

- que:
  - You mean, like a trip?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure, whatever.

- que:
  - California? You can go anywhere in the world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What is it? A Disneyland thing?
  ans:
  - No. I just kind of like the sound of it.

- que:
  - California, huh?
  ans:
  - California.

- que:
  - Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay?
  ans:
  - I'll be here.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe California.

- que:
  - You swear?
  ans:
  - You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.

- que:
  - You swear?
  ans:
  - That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.

- que:
  - Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
  ans:
  - Yes, I do.

- que:
  - Do you see him here in the courtroom?
  ans:
  - Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.

- que:
  - Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
  ans:
  - It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground. Two in the air.

- que:
  - Who's the co-pilot?
  ans:
  - Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.

- que:
  - For instance, something like this?
  ans:
  - Very nice. I'll take it.

- que:
  - Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
  ans:
  - All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.

- que:
  - What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
  ans:
  - Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.

- que:
  - Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
  ans:
  - I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.

- que:
  - This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
  ans:
  - No, man. I'm too fucked up.

- que:
  - Stoned?
  ans:
  - I wish there was shit like this back home.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - When there's something to move, it's too easy not to. Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, we need to get to the source.

- que:
  - Not that far, only halfway. You sure you know what you're doing?
  ans:
  - Holy shit, Dulli!

- que:
  - Nice weed, huh?
  ans:
  - Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I'm fucking wasted.

- que:
  - No shit, Kevin?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - And you believe the NLF?
  ans:
  - They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.

- que:
  - Dien Bien Phu?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - And here?
  ans:
  - It depends on you.

- que:
  - I understand. What's your question?
  ans:
  - The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...

- que:
  - Which \"district\" do you belong to?
  ans:
  - Second district ... Explain better ...

- que:
  - Third group. What's your assignment?
  ans:
  - Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.

- que:
  - You afraid of these ...?
  ans:
  - Don't move, Hacene.

- que:
  - Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
  ans:
  - It's true.

- que:
  - What's happened to you?
  ans:
  - The NLF has condemned you to death.

- que:
  - How much are they paying you?
  ans:
  - They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.

- que:
  - With an unloaded pistol?
  ans:
  - I'll explain.

- que:
  - And how many are we?
  ans:
  - Not enough.

- que:
  - Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
  ans:
  - No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.

- que:
  - Can you read?
  ans:
  - Sure ...

- que:
  - Where's Kader?
  ans:
  - With the others. They are trying to stop the people.

- que:
  - What do you think of the strike, Ali?
  ans:
  - I think it'll be a success ...

- que:
  - Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
  ans:
  - It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.

- que:
  - Good evening ... Can we pass?
  ans:
  - It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.

- que:
  - Where were we?
  ans:
  - Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...

- que:
  - Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
  ans:
  - Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...

- que:
  - A name?
  ans:
  - Yes, a name for the operation.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...

- que:
  - What is she saying?
  ans:
  - She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.

- que:
  - Who is speaking?
  ans:
  - Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.

- que:
  - How can I give you this statement?
  ans:
  - We'll lower a basket from the window ...

- que:
  - Are you ready, colonel?
  ans:
  - Yes ... But let me first see you.

- que:
  - Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh case?
  ans:
  - It could've happened to anyone.

- que:
  - So -- where do we start?
  ans:
  - Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.

- que:
  - You got something on the coke?
  ans:
  - No -- but I got something.

- que:
  - So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
  ans:
  - It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because it hasn't all been erased.

- que:
  - Right now. Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
  ans:
  - Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting. I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.

- que:
  - What good does that do -- it's the old will?
  ans:
  - She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it. Pretty slick.

- que:
  - You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
  ans:
  - Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.

- que:
  - What did he say about Miss Lawson?
  ans:
  - He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.

- que:
  - What about the will?
  ans:
  - That's the best part. She gets it all -- everything.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Cause?
  ans:
  - Not sure. I'll have everything you need tomorrow.

- que:
  - What'd he die of?
  ans:
  - The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.

- que:
  - The official cause?
  ans:
  - That's what my report will read.

- que:
  - What are you saying, Henry? That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Any prints on the nasal spray?
  ans:
  - Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.

- que:
  - Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
  ans:
  - A massive cardiac arrest.

- que:
  - What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
  ans:
  - Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.

- que:
  - Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What induced it?
  ans:
  - We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.

- que:
  - So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.

- que:
  - Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
  ans:
  - Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.

- que:
  - Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
  ans:
  - Increase his heart rate.

- que:
  - -- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
  ans:
  - It would be an added stress to his heart.

- que:
  - What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
  ans:
  - It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.

- que:
  - Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
  ans:
  - Like cats and dogs.

- que:
  - Did they argue the day before he died?
  ans:
  - Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.

- que:
  - What was the nature of the argument?
  ans:
  - Sex.

- que:
  - Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
  ans:
  - No -- never.

- que:
  - Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
  ans:
  - He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.

- que:
  - Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
  ans:
  - No questions.

- que:
  - Lookin' to make the papers, John?
  ans:
  - You can't show intent.

- que:
  - Can you?
  ans:
  - Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain't biting today.

- que:
  - C'mon -- think about it. If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
  ans:
  - She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.

- que:
  - Why would she want that?
  ans:
  - Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.

- que:
  - Then she's not as smart as I thought she was. You've seen her in the depositions. Tell me you don't have any doubts?
  ans:
  - She's innocent.

- que:
  - Aren't they all?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.

- que:
  - If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?

- que:
  - You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.

- que:
  - I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
  ans:
  - I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.

- que:
  - Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about Miss Lawson?
  ans:
  - Yes -- cocaine.

  ans:
  - Yes -- he mentioned it.

- que:
  - Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
  ans:
  - Yes. I suppose it's possible.

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.

- que:
  - You've tried it? Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
  ans:
  - I've been to a few -- yes.

- que:
  - You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - --And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - --and that he changed his will?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out. Why do you think he did that?
  ans:
  - She talked him into it. She wanted everything.

- que:
  - Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?
  ans:
  - Dristan nasal spray.

- que:
  - Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
  ans:
  - Three fifteen.

- que:
  - A.M -- or P.M.?
  ans:
  - P.M.

- que:
  - Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then you would have gotten your money?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do you have in your purse?
  ans:
  - What do you think I've got? A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too. Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.

- que:
  - You didn't know about it before that?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
  ans:
  - Because he called me.

- que:
  - I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
  ans:
  - You know I can't talk about that.

- que:
  - I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you think I did it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

- que:
  - No pain, no gain?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.

- que:
  - If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
  ans:
  - Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.

- que:
  - Sure. Where to?
  ans:
  - This is your house.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.

- que:
  - Is it against the law?
  ans:
  - No -- it just doesn't look right.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hi. It's Frank.

- que:
  - Tell me about Doctor Paley?
  ans:
  - I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.

- que:
  - Did you always want to be a lawyer?
  ans:
  - No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
  ans:
  - I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.

- que:
  - It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want?
  ans:
  - Yes -- it would be nice.

- que:
  - What would?
  ans:
  - You and me -- making love.

- que:
  - Is that what you think I was thinking?
  ans:
  - No -- that's what I know you were thinking.

- que:
  - I called you all weekend. Where were you?
  ans:
  - I went out on the boat.

- que:
  - Alone?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Can I see you later?
  ans:
  - You can see me now.

- que:
  - Something wrong?
  ans:
  - Paley could be a problem tomorrow.

- que:
  - Sugar or honey?
  ans:
  - Honey.

- que:
  - What's that for?
  ans:
  - To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.

- que:
  - You killed him -- didn't you?
  ans:
  - I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Frank -- It's Rebecca. I need to see you right away. I've got the tape.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.

- que:
  - What are they saying?
  ans:
  - The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.

- que:
  - She allegedly humped him to death?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is Mom yelling at you too?
  ans:
  - I love you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I'm expecting a call.

- que:
  - \"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities.\" Who told you to say that?
  ans:
  - No, Your Honor.

- que:
  - Mr. Roston?
  ans:
  - Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.

- que:
  - Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
  ans:
  - I can back it up.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
  ans:
  - If you want me to.

- que:
  - Can't it wait?
  ans:
  - No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

- que:
  - How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
  ans:
  - He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.

- que:
  - If he files are you going to take the case?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.

- que:
  - What's she like?
  ans:
  - Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when she wants to be.

- que:
  - I'll talk to him later.
  ans:
  - Yeah -- but can she cook?

- que:
  - Why don't you talk to him now?
  ans:
  - Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.

- que:
  - Is that alright, Frank?
  ans:
  - Yeah -- fine. Excuse me. I'll be right back.

- que:
  - Yeah -- what are you doing up?
  ans:
  - We have to talk.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.

- que:
  - Where have you been?
  ans:
  - Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.

- que:
  - Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why did you lie to me?
  ans:
  - Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.

- que:
  - You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why didn't you come to me?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
  ans:
  - Albert's got the stomach flu.

- que:
  - Not even if they're a dork?
  ans:
  - Not even if they're a dork. You should go by and see how he's feeling.

- que:
  - What time did you leave?
  ans:
  - Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.

- que:
  - Did Marsh use it?
  ans:
  - No -- never.

- que:
  - Why are there two deeds here?
  ans:
  - Oh, just a old letter from a friend.

- que:
  - No treasure maps, huh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
  ans:
  - No. You can have them.

- que:
  - Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
  ans:
  - Mom's orders.

- que:
  - Lawyer here?
  ans:
  - I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.

- que:
  - He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
  ans:
  - He's not coming.

- que:
  - What problem?
  ans:
  - Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.

- que:
  - Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.

- que:
  - This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd like to read them.

- que:
  - Then why do you?
  ans:
  - Bar across the street.

- que:
  - I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But I thought she died.

- que:
  - You mean -- she didn't like sex?
  ans:
  - I bet mom could've helped her.

- que:
  - Not yet. You want to go?
  ans:
  - I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.

- que:
  - You're right -- that is sick.
  ans:
  - Did we want to?

- que:
  - No, what?
  ans:
  - See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.

- que:
  - No. What a tragedy. What happened?
  ans:
  - She changed.

- que:
  - What do you know about \"the changes\"?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.

- que:
  - No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
  ans:
  - No, of course not. I'll just clean up.

- que:
  - Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Roseman Bridge?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - Oh, terrific. Which way?
  ans:
  - If I'm not taking you away from anything.

- que:
  - There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you from Washington originally?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.

- que:
  - Oh. When did you move back?
  ans:
  - After the divorce.

- que:
  - How long you been married?
  ans:
  - Uh... uh... Umm... long time.

- que:
  - Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
  ans:
  - Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.

- que:
  - You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Excuse me a sec.

- que:
  - Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
  ans:
  - Oh there you are.

- que:
  - Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
  ans:
  - Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.

- que:
  - Want another cigarette?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Lemon?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Mind if I smoke?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Sure you want to keep those in the house?
  ans:
  - I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.

- que:
  - Where are you staying while you're here?
  ans:
  - A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.

- que:
  - As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
  ans:
  - My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.

- que:
  - Oh. How old?
  ans:
  - About a year and a half.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.

- que:
  - What's he like?
  ans:
  - He's very... clean.

- que:
  - Clean?
  ans:
  - No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.

- que:
  - Feeling better?
  ans:
  - Much.

- que:
  - Is the dizziness gone?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Help cook?
  ans:
  - Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She starts sniffing me.

- que:
  - Then what happened?
  ans:
  - We got engaged.

- que:
  - \"Making pictures.\" I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
  ans:
  - I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.

- que:
  - Why, do you think?
  ans:
  - I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.

- que:
  - And did you?
  ans:
  - I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.

- que:
  - Why did you stop?
  ans:
  - My children. And Richard didn't like my working.

- que:
  - Do you miss it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.

- que:
  - You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. That was...

- que:
  - You drink bug repellent?
  ans:
  - No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.

- que:
  - You want to go back in?
  ans:
  - No. I'm all right. It's working.

- que:
  - This \"... Of what I call God and fools can Nature.\" Who wrote that?
  ans:
  - Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.

- que:
  - You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
  ans:
  - No. I'll do them later.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're not doing anything wrong, do you.

- que:
  - So what happened?
  ans:
  - You must get lonely at times.

- que:
  - Woman friends, too?
  ans:
  - I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.

- que:
  - Why doesn't it scare you?
  ans:
  - I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.

- que:
  - Do you ever regret not having a family?
  ans:
  - Not everybody's supposed to have a family.

- que:
  - But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
  ans:
  - I told you, I love other people.

- que:
  - Do you want to leave your husband?
  ans:
  - My mistake. I apologize.

- que:
  - What made you ask such a question?
  ans:
  - I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.

- que:
  - Francesca?
  ans:
  - Yes! Hi.

- que:
  - Am I interrupting anything?
  ans:
  - No. I was just... No.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I want you to come.

- que:
  - How about if I set the table?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Would you like a beer for your bath?
  ans:
  - Yes, that'd be nice.

- que:
  - Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
  ans:
  - No. I can't. Not yet.

- que:
  - Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.

- que:
  - How about Italy?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How about Bari?
  ans:
  - Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.

- que:
  - Have you ever been to that station?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.

- que:
  - Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
  ans:
  - Near the church.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Because I already tried once.

- que:
  - I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
  ans:
  - I had a temper.

- que:
  - What were your parents like?
  ans:
  - I can't do this, honey.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.

- que:
  - You're somewhere else, where?
  ans:
  - Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. And?
  ans:
  - You're right, you know. We don't have much time.

- que:
  - Where was she?
  ans:
  - Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.

- que:
  - Am I too heavy for you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Sleep all right?
  ans:
  - Yes, thanks.

- que:
  - Well, what is this?
  ans:
  - Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.

- que:
  - To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
  ans:
  - I was honest with you. I told you who I was.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.

- que:
  - How do you know what I experience?
  ans:
  - Stop it!

- que:
  - What do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.

- que:
  - What makes it different, Robert?
  ans:
  - No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.

- que:
  - For who?
  ans:
  - Then he can move! People move!

- que:
  - What about us? What about me?
  ans:
  - You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.

- que:
  - Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
  ans:
  - Yes. And I've accepted.

- que:
  - You feeling better Franny?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.

- que:
  - Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Later. Go back to sleep.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.

- que:
  - Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.

- que:
  - Are you seeing Betty tonight?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - Betty.

- que:
  - What's she like?
  ans:
  - Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.

- que:
  - Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
  ans:
  - Don't feed that dog.

- que:
  - Then what do you care?
  ans:
  - Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me.

- que:
  - Is it true?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too.

- que:
  - How the hell should I know?
  ans:
  - Hey, kid.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Take my advice. Get the hell out of there. It's a bad place. Always has been.

- que:
  - So what the hell's the good news?
  ans:
  - Bones! How baddass is zat? This is the place for us. Patrick, you get platinum props, man. Platinum.

- que:
  - What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
  ans:
  - Look around, this place is a dump! Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.

- que:
  - Are you nuts?
  ans:
  - Keep smokin', fool.

- que:
  - S up?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Contact paranoia. Must be buggin' from hanging with you.

- que:
  - You think that's really him?
  ans:
  - Damn. It's so...fresh.

- que:
  - Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
  ans:
  - Go for it.

- que:
  - You want us to move in here?
  ans:
  - That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.

- que:
  - Spooked?
  ans:
  - No. Well, yeah. Maybe just a little.

- que:
  - Where's the others?
  ans:
  - Maurice left. Tia's taking a bath.

- que:
  - You sure got a way with women, bro. What happened up there?
  ans:
  - Damned if I know.

- que:
  - Where's the gangsta of love?
  ans:
  - Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.

- que:
  - Climb out to where?
  ans:
  - Anywhere but here.

- que:
  - Is this Hell?
  ans:
  - Or just Hell-adjacent...

- que:
  - That's what?
  ans:
  - That's some terrible shit.

- que:
  - Looking to score?
  ans:
  - Unh-unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high.

- que:
  - Wh-wh-whooo?
  ans:
  - Bones.

- que:
  - Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood. What it is?
  ans:
  - What it will be.

- que:
  - Must be my clothes line. No? How bout my phone line?
  ans:
  - No baby. I'm serious. Cancel that meeting. I got more fruit that needs checking. Come home with me now.

- que:
  - No? That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now? Kill us? Kill us all?
  ans:
  - No. Not...not you. You I forgive.

- que:
  - Where are we, baby?
  ans:
  - Where we'll always be...

- que:
  - Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
  ans:
  - We met.

- que:
  - Time like this, is that what you really want to know? How I got the fuck in here?
  ans:
  - I don't understand it. You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas. I always looked after you. You had a piece of everything I had.

- que:
  - And the hell everybody else, right?
  ans:
  - I have to finish this for class.

- que:
  - You mean as opposed to your life?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Momma. Maybe next time.

- que:
  - Have you ever been inside?
  ans:
  - Maybe once upon a time. But that was long ago. Back before... before it became what it is.

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - Just a bad place. And the doorway to worse.

- que:
  - Who? Who is he? What is he?
  ans:
  - Your father. He was your father.

- que:
  - But if it's him. If he's really come back, won't he know us? Love us?
  ans:
  - But how do you know? Maybe he just wanted to see us? And now he's gone again. And you've all killed my father for the second time.

- que:
  - Aren't you gonna do something about it?
  ans:
  - I don't. Patrick doesn't. And his brother and sister don't. And they're in the house with him.

- que:
  - Are they on the radio?
  ans:
  - Naw. But they will be. They're the best.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I manage them.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says.

- que:
  - What else does she say?
  ans:
  - Nothing. You'd think she was crazy. And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.

- que:
  - Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off?
  ans:
  - Maybe. But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.

- que:
  - The dead get out?
  ans:
  - Or the living fall in. Who knows.

- que:
  - And you believe her?
  ans:
  - If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.

- que:
  - Cinn?
  ans:
  - What? Oh yeah. Coming.

- que:
  - I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
  ans:
  - I can't. Not yet.

- que:
  - Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
  ans:
  - Back here. At the end of the block.

- que:
  - You got the shit?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot. Leave your car and walk over here.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - I can't carry it in my pocket, man. And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop. You gonna have to pick it up yourself.

- que:
  - What are we doing down here?
  ans:
  - Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself.

- que:
  - Why? Why did you give a shit about the building? Why did you care that we were there of all places?
  ans:
  - It's...it's a bad neighborhood. As you can see now.

- que:
  - Dad?
  ans:
  - Help me. I'm so sorry. But please, help me...

- que:
  - What the hell do you want?
  ans:
  - Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.

- que:
  - Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
  ans:
  - I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted.

- que:
  - You cut him, or I shoot you. Make your choice.
  ans:
  - What building?

- que:
  - I ain't killed nobody. Shall I rack 'em? Play a game, Lupe?
  ans:
  - No time for eightball. I got your tip.

- que:
  - I'm on my way home. Can you handle it yourself?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.

- que:
  - No more thoughts from your asses. Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
  ans:
  - We didn't do nothing, Eddie.

- que:
  - You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
  ans:
  - That's all we did, steal their ride.

- que:
  - Then how'd you hear it, fool?
  ans:
  - It was just like in my head.

- que:
  - You haven't?
  ans:
  - Not that I remember.

- que:
  - I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
  ans:
  - The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.

- que:
  - Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - You look mighty familiar to me. You sure you're not from around here?
  ans:
  - I was born near here. But after my mother died, my dad moved. I grew up out in Rossmore Park.

- que:
  - Save him? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - But the place burned to the ground.

- que:
  - Boy, put that thing down. You can't take that. Might be evidence.
  ans:
  - Illibent? Who's club is that?

- que:
  - Evidence of what?
  ans:
  - Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.

- que:
  - You want to get into this now?
  ans:
  - No, no, Caesar. Not now.

- que:
  - Glenlivet, right, Gino?
  ans:
  - I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

- que:
  - So Caesar, what did it total out at?
  ans:
  - Two point one seventy-six.

- que:
  - What's that, Johnnie?
  ans:
  - The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...

- que:
  - Where is this going, Johnnie?
  ans:
  - Just admit it, Caesar.

- que:
  - Admit what?
  ans:
  - That you overreacted. That you lost it. Not me. It was your mistake.

- que:
  - All right! Where's the key?
  ans:
  - You don't need a key.

- que:
  - How the fuck can I open it?
  ans:
  - The same way you did before.

- que:
  - We know how this was done, eh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I know.

- que:
  - What the fuck is going on?
  ans:
  - Oh, shit ...

- que:
  - Not bad. What for?
  ans:
  - That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.

- que:
  - Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
  ans:
  - Why? Cause you know him?

- que:
  - What are you going to do with it?
  ans:
  - I told them to run it through the cycles. But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.

- que:
  - Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
  ans:
  - Ummm ... in the linen closet.

- que:
  - You mean they weren't up here?
  ans:
  - No! They're still on their way.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.

- que:
  - Caesar, what are we going to do?
  ans:
  - Got to think this through ...

- que:
  - He didn't see you, did he?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Caesar, what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.

- que:
  - What happened to them?
  ans:
  - I don't know. We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.

- que:
  - Caesar, what are we going to do?
  ans:
  - They're just cops. Stall them as long as you can.

- que:
  - Where, then?
  ans:
  - I don't know. it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time. Let's get out of here.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - We're going to need some time.

- que:
  - Who are you going to call?
  ans:
  - I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ... I need plastic bags ... tape and rope ...

- que:
  - Let us go and we'll make a deal.
  ans:
  - Where is the money?

- que:
  - What did she do to you?
  ans:
  - You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.

- que:
  - How's it going tonight, fellas?
  ans:
  - Pretty good, sir.

- que:
  - I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
  ans:
  - Go right ahead, sir.

- que:
  - You're helping Rajeev?
  ans:
  - No. Rajeev's in India.

- que:
  - How many'd you do?
  ans:
  - Five.

- que:
  - What? How about a drink?
  ans:
  - My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.

- que:
  - Now, where the fuck is my money?
  ans:
  - Lick me.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I could be lying.

- que:
  - Are you okay, Violet?
  ans:
  - Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.

- que:
  - Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
  ans:
  - Sure, Mickey. Sure.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Hey, Mickey.

- que:
  - What? They ain't there?
  ans:
  - No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.

- que:
  - Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do. Don't go anywhere, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, sure, Mick.

- que:
  - Caesar, you still got the money?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Mick. I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.

- que:
  - Me? Why?
  ans:
  - We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.

- que:
  - Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.

- que:
  - Cease, can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why'd you move all the furniture around?
  ans:
  - Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right. You know women, Mick.

- que:
  - Is that the money?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's it.

- que:
  - Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
  ans:
  - Un-fucking-believable. I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - No joke, ma'am. Please open the door.

- que:
  - How do I know you are cops?
  ans:
  - Ma'am, you have to open the door.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.

- que:
  - So this is temporary for you?
  ans:
  - Pretty much. One day at a time.

- que:
  - A favor?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm sorry --

- que:
  - Are they really?
  ans:
  - Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...

- que:
  - You're doing everything yourself?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
  ans:
  - I don't, really. I was referred to him.

- que:
  - Do you know him?
  ans:
  - No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.

- que:
  - Caesar is your husband?
  ans:
  - Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind.

- que:
  - Do you have a pot or a bucket?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - A beer?
  ans:
  - A beer. Of course.

- que:
  - You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you surprised that I know what it is?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
  ans:
  - Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I want to. I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.

- que:
  - If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You have to ask?
  ans:
  - They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it.

- que:
  - He's a launderer?
  ans:
  - Basically.

- que:
  - How long have you been with him?
  ans:
  - Almost five years.

- que:
  - The redistribution of wealth?
  ans:
  - That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You didn't want to see me, did you?
  ans:
  - If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.

- que:
  - What are you afraid of?
  ans:
  - I'm not afraid of anything.

- que:
  - I don't understand - ?
  ans:
  - I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different.

- que:
  - How can you sit in that bed and say that?
  ans:
  - Because it's the truth.

- que:
  - Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
  ans:
  - Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you.

- que:
  - Is that what her daddy tells her?
  ans:
  - I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

- que:
  - What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men?
  ans:
  - I don't.

- que:
  - For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
  ans:
  - What you heard wasn't sex.

- que:
  - What was it then?
  ans:
  - Work.

- que:
  - You mean Shelly?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.

- que:
  - Even though he knew about you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - He was in love with you, right?
  ans:
  - For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.

- que:
  - Mickey?
  ans:
  - I want out. I want a new life. I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.

- que:
  - How much money?
  ans:
  - Shelly said it was over two million dollars.

- que:
  - You think I'm lying?
  ans:
  - All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.

- que:
  - Is that what you think?
  ans:
  - I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this.

- que:
  - Do you think you know me like that?
  ans:
  - I think ...

- que:
  - You said he washed the money?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - To let it dry.

- que:
  - And where is it now?
  ans:
  - In his office. I saw it this morning.

- que:
  - Does the case lock?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Johnnie?
  ans:
  - It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.

- que:
  - Who is Gino?
  ans:

- que:
  - Has Caesar ever seen him?

  ans:
  - The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.

  - If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
  ans:
  - I had a partner and she fucked me.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind.

- que:
  - What if he doesn't run?

  - You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Pop?
  ans:
  - Caesar, come here. Sit. We talk now. You too, Johnnie.

- que:
  - Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet?
  ans:
  - Hey, Johnnie ...

- que:
  - Johnnie, what did I say?
  ans:
  - Pop, this is important to me. It's a simple question. if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.

  - Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar. You just get out of here, okay?
  ans:
  - Oh, God.

- que:
  - Mickey? What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.

- que:
  - Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
  ans:
  - I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.

- que:
  - You're asking me a direct question?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And what if I couldn't do that?
  ans:
  - She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one.

- que:
  - We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?
  ans:
  - Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.

- que:
  - What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned?
  ans:
  - No. We can't risk it.

- que:
  - I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.
  ans:
  - What do you want to do?

  - Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
  ans:
  - Go away.

- que:
  - What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
  ans:
  - Layton.

- que:
  - Jill Layton ... You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm waiting for my daddy.

- que:
  - In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
  ans:
  - Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

- que:
  - Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
  ans:
  - David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.

  - Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
  ans:
  - But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...

- que:
  - Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
  ans:
  - Too late? That's for me to say.

- que:
  - Am I?
  ans:
  - Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.

- que:
  - How much do you know?
  ans:
  - Not much.

- que:
  - Enough though, eh?
  ans:
  - Not really, no.

- que:
  - You got the wrong man.
  ans:
  - B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?

- que:
  - You killed him?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you have

- que:
  - What has Tuttle done?
  ans:
  - We suspect him of freelance subversion.

- que:
  - You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
  ans:
  - Er ... no.

- que:
  - A terrorist?
  ans:
  - But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...

- que:
  - Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.

- que:
  - So what are you going to do about her?
  ans:
  - Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.

- que:
  - Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
  ans:
  - Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.

- que:
  - Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?

  ans:
  - I do. Goodbye.

- que:
  - Where do I get it stamped?
  ans:
  - Information Adjustments.

- que:
  - You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
  ans:
  - If you say so.

- que:
  - You think these are tits don't you?
  ans:
  - Ah.

- que:
  - I bet you'd like to touch them?
  ans:
  - It's you ... it's you ...

  - Them?
  ans:
  - Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.

- que:
  - Are you still following me?
  ans:
  - Please, Jill ... I love you.

- que:
  - You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
  ans:
  - There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?

- que:
  - You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
  ans:
  - I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.

- que:
  - Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Your face ... are you hurt?

  - Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.

- que:
  - Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How?
  ans:
  - Well, you have your choice, pills, injection, gas.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - What the hell. The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.

- que:
  - Is he going to be alright?
  ans:
  - His heart's beating.

- que:
  - Is there any chance?
  ans:
  - I guess there's always a chance.

- que:
  - That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - He's dead, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you see my father?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.

- que:
  - He's better, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - Sleeping.

- que:
  - He's better, though, right?
  ans:
  - He's better.

- que:
  - It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh?
  ans:
  - Not as good as Nino's.

- que:
  - Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
  ans:
  - I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.

- que:
  - On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
  ans:
  - We moved out after that. Upstate.

- que:
  - Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
  ans:
  - They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.

- que:
  - You married?
  ans:
  - Ah, no. I was. It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.

- que:
  - How long you been doing this?
  ans:
  - Five years.

- que:
  - Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
  ans:
  - You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.

- que:
  - Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
  ans:
  - Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.

- que:
  - Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
  ans:
  - No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Frank.

- que:
  - My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
  ans:
  - I think the worst is over.

- que:
  - Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? She hit you with a bottle?
  ans:
  - She loves me the way no woman ever has.

- que:
  - I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
  ans:
  - Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.

- que:
  - Rule number one, Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two, Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
  ans:
  - What about rule number three, Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.

- que:
  - What's that, Frank?
  ans:
  - Three legs.

- que:
  - Backup?
  ans:
  - It's coming.

- que:
  - What look?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.

- que:
  - I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone. Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
  ans:
  - Where you going?

- que:
  - He one of them?
  ans:
  - That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

- que:
  - How many times have you shocked him tonight?
  ans:
  - Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.

- que:
  - What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
  ans:
  - A medical miracle.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where's Burke?
  ans:
  - Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.

- que:
  - Would you like to come in?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yeah. Great, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.

- que:
  - Whatja doing?
  ans:
  - I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I never felt better in my life.

- que:
  - Whadda we bring?
  ans:
  - Better bring it all.

- que:
  - How's he doing?
  ans:
  - I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.

- que:
  - Who with?
  ans:
  - That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.

- que:
  - What do you want to break?
  ans:
  - I don't know--let's break some windows.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - That's ridiculous.

- que:
  - No shit.
  ans:
  - You learn that in the army?

- que:
  - The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
  ans:
  - I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not hungry.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know what. The radio.

- que:
  - Well why didn't you say so?
  ans:
  - He's drunk.

- que:
  - Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
  ans:
  - He's crazy.

- que:
  - You really think so?
  ans:
  - You're in the stomach! Let me try.

- que:
  - Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You write this?
  ans:
  - Nice, Jane.

- que:
  - Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
  ans:
  - Same old stuff. I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

- que:
  - You want to go out there -- get out of this for a second?
  ans:
  - Why don't you lead? I'll just follow the flurry you cause.

- que:
  - What did I do to you?
  ans:
  - You've made my dreams silly.

- que:
  - Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
  ans:
  - Keep it to yourself.

- que:
  - Okay. Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
  ans:
  - I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...

- que:
  - Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
  ans:
  - Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...

- que:
  - We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind. What are they?
  ans:
  - Don't name them. Just tell me if you know.

- que:
  - You're feeling good, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.

- que:
  - Fifty, right?
  ans:
  - I'm in a pissy mood. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - What's wrong with it?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I think you really blew the lid off nookie.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your coat jacket is rising up in back.

- que:
  - I'll put her on.
  ans:
  - No?

- que:
  - What did they do with you?
  ans:
  - They booted me out of Washington.

- que:
  - I don't think so.
  ans:
  - Why? What did they do to you?

- que:
  - Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
  ans:
  - No. I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.

- que:
  - He excels at gratitude.
  ans:
  - Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else. What's your name?

- que:
  - Are you any closer to a decision?
  ans:
  - It's nice to see you.

- que:
  - It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That's your full name?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I might as well ask you the questions on tape. Is that all right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
  ans:
  - I don't like the word gay.

- que:
  - Which would you prefer?
  ans:
  - Ravenous homosexual.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.

- que:
  - Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on?
  ans:
  - Call if you get weird.

- que:
  - Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
  ans:
  - I didn't sleep. They're giving me less and less air time. They don't think I'm at all anchor material.

- que:
  - Did you shoot their boots?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
  ans:
  - What happened?

- que:
  - Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - A long time. I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
  ans:
  - Aaah -- -- ello. You sure they said the management meeting? They want me to be at the management meeting.

- que:
  - Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
  ans:
  - I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...

- que:
  - You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did it really go well?
  ans:
  - Define your terms.

- que:
  - Do you feel good about it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do others feel that you did well?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then what was good about it?
  ans:
  - I lost six pounds...

- que:
  - Aaron, will you tell me?
  ans:
  - What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...

- que:
  - There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
  ans:
  - No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.

- que:
  - If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
  ans:
  - I have to be somewhere.

- que:
  - Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I may be in love with him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Let me think a second. It's tough.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.

- que:
  - Hi. Will I ever sing again?
  ans:
  - Bastard, sneak, quitter.

- que:
  - Why not try it for a few weeks?
  ans:
  - Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...

- que:
  - I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
  ans:
  - Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.

- que:
  - You are now required to sit here with me. Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
  ans:
  - I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I'm going to take it.

- que:
  - So who's the guy?
  ans:
  - Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating. So, he's been getting me into water skiing.

- que:
  - I like it! So, doll, what about you lately?
  ans:
  - Well -- my wife got this new job...

- que:
  - In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
  ans:
  - No -- Don't worry about it. Let's do this.

- que:
  - You didn't say anything to her?
  ans:
  - That's it. I resign as of now.

- que:
  - Just tell me what's really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
  ans:
  - Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?

- que:
  - Wipe me out?
  ans:
  - Anyway. I want you to think of this as...

- que:
  - Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy?
  ans:
  - It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you. Just on superficial performance things.

- que:
  - Just a few questions?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
  ans:
  - It depends on how big a news day it is.

- que:
  - All this business of war -- do you get scared?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh. I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.

- que:
  - My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
  ans:
  - What is she shooting?

- que:
  - Just when do you start, telling people?
  ans:
  - Almost immediately.

- que:
  - Jane?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
  ans:
  - No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - I'll never tell.

- que:
  - Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond. Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

- que:
  - Do you want him all the way to the car?
  ans:
  - No stop where he's all besieged.

- que:
  - They're not really going to call security are they?
  ans:
  - No, I don't think so.

- que:
  - How do I get out of here?
  ans:
  - Follow me.

- que:
  - Yes. How do you know?
  ans:
  - My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen. Hey, and from now on, so do you.

- que:
  - What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
  ans:
  - No. Really...don't worry about it.

- que:
  - Is everything all right?
  ans:
  - Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...

- que:
  - Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They fired me.

- que:
  - I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more. You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
  ans:
  - No. Not even you.

- que:
  - Why so glum?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I got my report card. Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
  ans:
  - Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?

- que:
  - Oh my. I see you studying so hard, Tom. What do you think the problem is?
  ans:
  - I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will. I will. I will. I will.

- que:
  - That would be great. It better help. What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
  ans:
  - Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.

- que:
  - You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
  ans:
  - It must be nice to always believe you know better. To think you're always the smartest person in the room.

- que:
  - That actually goes on...
  ans:
  - I like \"godsend.\"

- que:
  - Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
  ans:
  - Yes, sure.

- que:
  - So great -- right?
  ans:
  - Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.

- que:
  - How are you at back rubs?
  ans:
  - I trust you.

- que:
  - Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
  ans:
  - One year...almost one year.

- que:
  - Hey?
  ans:
  - Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry.

- que:
  - I can't help you, sorry. I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
  ans:
  - You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here?

- que:
  - And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
  ans:
  - I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.

- que:
  - So he was indicted?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
  ans:
  - Billion.

- que:
  - What do you mean clean?
  ans:
  - At work there's always this sort of film over you.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - I'll wait for you till seven.

- que:
  - Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
  ans:
  - Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself. I feel like a little solitude.

- que:
  - Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
  ans:
  - I'll get you through. Move and smile. And smile and move...

- que:
  - Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
  ans:
  - Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...

- que:
  - Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
  ans:
  - Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.

- que:
  - If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
  ans:
  - Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

- que:
  - Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No. Were you going to you?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - So you like me, huh?
  ans:
  - I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

- que:
  - So what did you think?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar. How's that?
  ans:
  - Good. That's it...See you.

- que:
  - You're not going to take off on me, are you?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Why can't I let go of this woman?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
  ans:
  - This is hysterical.

- que:
  - I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why?
  ans:
  - Because you're nuts.

- que:
  - Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
  ans:
  - I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.

- que:
  - He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
  ans:
  - It's not that it's hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.

- que:
  - Well, when?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.

- que:
  - Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.' Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy. You want me to talk to him?
  ans:
  - Hi, again. Sorry about...

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
  ans:
  - He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.

- que:
  - No. Did he really?
  ans:
  - Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.

- que:
  - How can you say that to me?
  ans:
  - Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.

- que:
  - You fucking...
  ans:
  - That's yes?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.

- que:
  - We disagree on how God-awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
  ans:
  - Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and...

- que:
  - It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
  ans:
  - It just proves that the difference we have are...

- que:
  - You want to come?
  ans:
  - It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...

- que:
  - A picnic?
  ans:
  - I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you? You're more adorable than your pictures. Look what I got for you.

- que:
  - How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.

- que:
  - This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
  ans:
  - I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up. I'll get you a great tour.

- que:
  - Where's the bathroom?
  ans:
  - Through the closet.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
  ans:
  - The way you were looking at me, I just went.

- que:
  - Would you like to do me?
  ans:
  - I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.

- que:
  - Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What, right now?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Are you nervous, Walter?
  ans:
  - N-no...

- que:
  - Not even a little bit?
  ans:
  - I already told you I'm not.

- que:
  - Are you a virgin?
  ans:
  - It's just an innocent question. Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.

- que:
  - Whaddya mean?
  ans:
  - Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.

- que:
  - Anything new?
  ans:
  - Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.

- que:
  - Is the manager cooperating?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.

- que:
  - What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.

- que:
  - What did he do?
  ans:
  - He made a cat.

- que:
  - Don't worry about him...what have you got?
  ans:
  - Of course...it's wonderful.

- que:
  - What's it called?
  ans:
  - Murdered man.

- que:
  - How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
  ans:
  - It wasn't easy.

- que:
  - What's up, Walter?
  ans:
  - I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.

- que:
  - You think she's better than Murdered Man?
  ans:
  - Well I can't say that Walter! She's incomparable. They're both great.

- que:
  - More champagne, your majesty?
  ans:
  - Here here...

- que:
  - Sorry...
  ans:
  - May I please have another little kiss?

- que:
  - Did you hear what he said?
  ans:
  - Yes Walter.

- que:
  - It's true, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Every word...

- que:
  - Are you ready?
  ans:
  - Ready? We've got plenty of time.

- que:
  - Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.

- que:
  - Uh... ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
  ans:
  - Oh...f-for a long time. Ever since you first came to the club.

- que:
  - I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
  ans:
  - Just about anything, Walter.

- que:
  - Would you let me make...a statue of you?
  ans:
  - Would you really like to? That would make me very happy.

- que:
  - Ok...tonight. I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
  ans:
  - Walter...there's...

- que:
  - When did you make this, Walter?
  ans:
  - Walter...I can't believe it.

- que:
  - I'm trying to find a style of my own. Do you really like them?
  ans:
  - Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...

- que:
  - What are you doing here so early?
  ans:
  - Maybe so...

- que:
  - When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
  ans:
  - Leonard, what are you doing?

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Nothing...nothing at all.

- que:
  - I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
  ans:
  - Don't ask.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
  ans:
  - You're right. We should build a collection first.

- que:
  - Would you pose for me for free?
  ans:
  - Well, it all depends, Leonard...

- que:
  - I know, man.
  ans:
  - Yeah, can you say plagiarism?

- que:
  - I mean, screw them, you know? I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here - you know?
  ans:
  - I know, man.

- que:
  - Now what kind of statue was that?
  ans:
  - No man I'm on my own plane.

- que:
  - Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone? You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
  ans:
  - I was just looking at Carla's picture.

- que:
  - Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
  ans:
  - Well I was uh, just looking...

- que:
  - Where'd ya buy that?
  ans:
  - I didn't buy it I made it.

- que:
  - Dead Cat?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You want to buy it, put it in the club?
  ans:
  - You want me to buy Dead Cat? It'll scare people away.

- que:
  - Well...why did you put a knife in it?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean to.

- que:
  - Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty. How's that?
  ans:
  - Sure! So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.

- que:
  - A parakeet?
  ans:
  - Go home.

- que:
  - Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
  ans:
  - H-have a seat?

- que:
  - They are?
  ans:
  - Hiya Carla.

- que:
  - Well...why murdered man?
  ans:
  - I don't know, it just happened, I guess. I didn't mean to.

- que:
  - You didn't mean to what?
  ans:
  - Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.

- que:
  - A show?! Like this Sunday?
  ans:
  - N-no! Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...

- que:
  - A show..how soon can we go?
  ans:
  - These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...

- que:
  - Yeah, why?
  ans:
  - You might talk too much.

- que:
  - Hello Leonard! Beautiful morning, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It was.

- que:
  - Whatsamatter Leonard?
  ans:
  - Never mind...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...

- que:
  - What do you want for it? Two thousand? Three thousand?
  ans:
  - Uh, hi.

- que:
  - Yes, you have. Can I come in?
  ans:
  - Uh, sure.

- que:
  - Did you see my cat?
  ans:
  - Yeah I did.

- que:
  - You are?
  ans:
  - I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head.

- que:
  - Are you done with these?
  ans:
  - Yes, get rid of them...

- que:
  - Did you like it Mister Brock?
  ans:
  - Call me...Maxwell.

- que:
  - And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
  ans:
  - No thanks. Sounds good though.

- que:
  - I get it Walter. I get it.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - What do you get?
  ans:
  - Your work, the layers of irony.

- que:
  - With Dead Cat?
  ans:
  - With Dead Cat. Like a breath of fresh air. I could just - babble on about it for hours.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - It's like...you've turned on.

- que:
  - T-turned on?
  ans:
  - A hot light bulb is burning inside of you. I want to be warmed by it.

- que:
  - Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
  ans:
  - If you see him.

- que:
  - Straightening up indeed! Are you sure you're not alone?
  ans:
  - I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.

- que:
  - Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
  ans:
  - Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker. Somebody's got to.

- que:
  - The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.

- que:
  - Coach knows what abs are?
  ans:
  - Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.

- que:
  - What's with you?
  ans:
  - Nice to feel needed.

- que:
  - He's got a... What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
  ans:
  - Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?

- que:
  - Don't grab me, okay?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake.

- que:
  - Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want?
  ans:
  - Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.

- que:
  - Would you sleep with them?
  ans:
  - Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God.

- que:
  - Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all about?
  ans:
  - I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.

- que:
  - You think? Split?
  ans:
  - Utterly. Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know. Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Wheels?
  ans:
  - My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me.

- que:
  - Which way did she go?
  ans:
  - Down there.

- que:
  - What's playing there?
  ans:
  - Your parents are always going away for the weekend. You're so lucky.

- que:
  - Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
  ans:
  - Guys. The environment. I'm telling you, it's totally key. The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

- que:
  - Don't tread on the earth?
  ans:
  - Dying.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Have you gained a few pounds? Maybe it's that outfit...

- que:
  - What's Bobby gonna say?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I... yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

- que:
  - What show is this?
  ans:
  - It's the news, Buffy.

- que:
  - What'd you dream about?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Come on, what was it?
  ans:
  - Nothing. It was just a dream.

- que:
  - Jealous?
  ans:
  - Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look beat.

- que:
  - So that's your tutor, huh? What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
  ans:
  - Jeffrey. Projectile vomit.

- que:
  - Buffy, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I thought we were meeting here.

- que:
  - You broke up with my machine?
  ans:
  - You weren't home. Like always.

- que:
  - You left me a message?
  ans:
  - I'm out of here. Jenny.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're even weaker than the others.

- que:
  - This? This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Will you guys shut up, please?
  ans:
  - It could happen.

- que:
  - Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
  ans:
  - You guys are thrashed.

- que:
  - Yeah, we're drunk. We're the Drunks. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Buffy.

- que:
  - How are you doing?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though.

- que:
  - You want some water or something?
  ans:
  - Water. Okay.

- que:
  - Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - They were vampires, weren't they?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I was bailing. I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess. Bad scene.

- que:
  - Where are you gonna go?
  ans:
  - Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.

- que:
  - Hey, jeez are you okay? You need a hand?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. It doesn't hurt.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You know, you saved my life. And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.

- que:
  - Why'd you come back?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I kind of thought I ought to be here. You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.

- que:
  - Buffy? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Oh, God. It's him. I think it's him.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Merrick...

- que:
  - I been working on some stuff for you. What'cha doing?
  ans:
  - I'm going shopping. Don't try to stop me.

- que:
  - Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need?
  ans:
  - A dress.

- que:
  - Dress, huh? What for?
  ans:
  - For the dance.

- que:
  - Come again?
  ans:
  - I'm going to the senior dance.

- que:
  - I don't believe this. The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
  ans:
  - It's not a mixer. It's the senior dance. And it's important. You wouldn't understand.

- que:
  - Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
  ans:
  - I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.

- que:
  - Bugs.
  ans:
  - Are you okay?

- que:
  - Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
  ans:
  - Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like my homework.

- que:
  - ) What do you think?
  ans:
  - Please. It's so '91.

- que:
  - Well, where?
  ans:
  - Beverly Center.

- que:
  - Totally stale. And the ushers are like, the acne patrol. We're thinking Pavilion. Sitch?
  ans:
  - Cafe Blase.

- que:
  - Listen to you. What language are you speaking?
  ans:
  - Get out of my facial.

- que:
  - What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for you, actually.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To bring you... your birthright.

- que:
  - My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund?
  ans:
  - I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.

- que:
  - Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
  ans:
  - You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time.

- que:
  - Time to do what?
  ans:
  - To stop the killing. To stop the vampires.

- que:
  - Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
  ans:
  - I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof. You bear the mark.

- que:
  - Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
  ans:
  - Everybody does.

- que:
  - How do you know all this?
  ans:
  - I have to show you.

- que:
  - Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.

- que:
  - Cramps?
  ans:
  - None of your business. God.

- que:
  - All right. What do we do now?
  ans:
  - We wait for Robert to wake up.

- que:
  - Skip it.
  ans:
  - Where's the other one?

- que:
  - They can't come in, right? Unless you invite them. Is that true?
  ans:
  - It's true.

- que:
  - What, um... What do we do?
  ans:
  - There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start There's so little time.

- que:
  - A Vampire-King? You mean like Dracula?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We'll cover it later.

- que:
  - Great. First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate. Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
  ans:
  - We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out. For your parents.

- que:
  - But you enjoyed it, yes?
  ans:
  - Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.

- que:
  - Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes?
  ans:
  - Sporting events, yeah.

- que:
  - Here?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.

- que:
  - It was necessary.
  ans:
  - Who we gonna beat?

- que:
  - Put your head back.
  ans:
  - Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?

- que:
  - Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
  ans:
  - No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.

- que:
  - What about bats? Do they turn into bats?
  ans:
  - No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.

- que:
  - Good Lord. What do you study in history?
  ans:
  - My nails.

- que:
  - They were vampires?
  ans:
  - Same one.

- que:
  - Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - A wet! Didn't I just kill that vampire? I think I did. I didn't see you killing any vampires. You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.

- que:
  - Aren't I, like the chosen one? The one and only? The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? Like, ever?
  ans:
  - I...

- que:
  - Five?
  ans:
  - Five.

- que:
  - So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
  ans:
  - Not if you're careful.

- que:
  - How can you keep doing this?
  ans:
  - It's what I was raised to do. There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.

- que:
  - Watchers?
  ans:
  - I wish you would.

- que:
  - And it makes it worse when I die, right?
  ans:
  - Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy. I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.

- que:
  - As for example, what?
  ans:
  - Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.

- que:
  - But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
  ans:
  - My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.

- que:
  - Why because it's not my fate? It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
  ans:
  - Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it. Your fate.

- que:
  - They don't even have Dolby.
  ans:
  - And where are they now?

- que:
  - So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
  ans:
  - That's the plan.

- que:
  - You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
  ans:
  - Buffy, Jesus! You know these steps.

- que:
  - You're having a fling with him?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess you got what you came for.

- que:
  - What's happening? What do you want?
  ans:
  - So very much.

- que:
  - What... are you?
  ans:
  - No, wait. I can be dumb. Really. Or mean, or whatever. I can learn. I'm useful.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Swear to God.

- que:
  - Why? Why me?
  ans:
  - She has died. You are the next to be called. Why do you think you were sent to me? Trained as you were? You bear the mark.

- que:
  - Bessel! What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Hi, Grueller.

- que:
  - What are you grinning at? You think I was scared?
  ans:
  - Could be.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Could be.

- que:
  - Listen, you little worm. I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that? You got that?
  ans:
  - Got that.

- que:
  - I can't believe they still ate it.
  ans:
  - Okay, what else?

- que:
  - Where'd you learn how to do that?
  ans:
  - Well, I hope so.

- que:
  - I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it?
  ans:
  - Throw it out.

- que:
  - Omniplex?
  ans:
  - Nee sitch. No way.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - You're kidding.

- que:
  - Does Jeffrey know?
  ans:
  - Oh, God.

- que:
  - The homelesses?
  ans:
  - Oh, please.

- que:
  - Can't they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She's such a scud. Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
  ans:
  - Well, look who's here.

- que:
  - Seriously, Buffy. That look was way twisted. What were you thinking about?
  ans:
  - I really was way way too too.

- que:
  - Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
  ans:
  - I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?' And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!' Way mental.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Except for Prom.

- que:
  - What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.

- que:
  - No... You want me to give him a message?
  ans:
  - You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place... Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird.

- que:
  - Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?
  ans:
  - Run.

- que:
  - Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
  ans:
  - Yeah maybe you're right.

- que:
  - You see how nice things are when we go slow?
  ans:
  - You can learn to like it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.

- que:
  - Catch?
  ans:
  - This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.

- que:
  - Which nostril am I breathing through?
  ans:
  - The right nostril. Good.

- que:
  - My right nostril?
  ans:
  - The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.

- que:
  - Switch nostrils?
  ans:
  - Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.

- que:
  - How was that?
  ans:
  - Much better. Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me. This is progress.

- que:
  - Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke-- You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
  ans:
  - I'm yours.

- que:
  - Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
  ans:
  - No, no, it was great.

- que:
  - How 'bout a back rub?
  ans:
  - No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap.

- que:
  - Fundamentals?
  ans:
  - I think you're real cute.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.

- que:
  - He did?
  ans:
  - I'll be back when we lose.

- que:
  - Oh--won't YOU come in?
  ans:
  - Well I guess this is it.

- que:
  - You should be at the game.
  ans:
  - That's better. Got the radar ready?

- que:
  - Five hours. We both just know. Do you think I deserve to wear white?
  ans:
  - We all deserve to wear white.

- que:
  - Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?
  ans:
  - I don't dance.

- que:
  - What do you believe in?
  ans:
  - Oh my... Don't leave...

- que:
  - See my hips?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - So...Wanta make love?
  ans:
  - I'm committed to Nuke for the season. You had your chance the other night.

- que:
  - Well, Annie, your place or mine?
  ans:
  - You got me all confused.

- que:
  - Who are you? Do you have a job?
  ans:
  - I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.

- que:
  - And now you wanta teach me?
  ans:
  - I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.

- que:
  - I don't know if I'd go that far.
  ans:
  - What's so great about baseball?

- que:
  - It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
  ans:
  - It's possible.

- que:
  - Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
  ans:
  - Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.

- que:
  - I heard already.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.

  ans:
  - I can do that, too.

  ans:
  - Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that? Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" LaLoosh.

  ans:
  - I told him.

- que:
  - How come you don't like me?
  ans:
  - Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem. You got a gift.

- que:
  - What do I got?
  ans:
  - A gift. When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.

- que:
  - You been in the Majors?
  ans:

  - If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
  ans:
  - I won't have to.

  - What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
  ans:
  - If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.

- que:
  - I was great, eh?
  ans:
  - Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.

- que:
  - You're the boss.
  ans:
  - Can't you let me enjoy the moment?

- que:
  - You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
  ans:
  - Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet...damn...

- que:
  - What do I gotta do?
  ans:
  - You outta your mind? If you give in now you might start losing. Never fuck with a winning streak.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - My right.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:

- que:
  - Can I give you my testimony?
  ans:
  - You can do anything you want. Hop in.

  ans:
  - No. The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.

- que:
  - Better find our bonus baby, eh?
  ans:
  - Little high.

- que:
  - Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
  ans:
  - Ohyeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya?

- que:
  - Eight and sixteen?! How'd we ever win eight? Jose, what's this sign?
  ans:
  - Eight and twenty-four.

- que:
  - Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever win 8 games?
  ans:
  - It's a miracle.

- que:
  - Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
  ans:
  - I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.

- que:
  - Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose. Anything bothering him?
  ans:
  - He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.

  ans:
  - Well, I'd rather not say.

- que:
  - He goes to a whorehouse every night?
  ans:
  - Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this to me?
  ans:
  - I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...

- que:
  - Was I at that dinner?
  ans:
  - You were wandering around.

- que:
  - Was I at that dinner?
  ans:
  - You were wandering around.

- que:
  - Was I at that dinner?
  ans:
  - You were in the m- You were in the building.

- que:
  - But what happens when they do find out?
  ans:
  - They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.

- que:
  - ...been right, but who knows?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.

- que:
  - Fine, fine. How's your family?
  ans:
  - Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.

- que:
  - M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
  ans:
  - Hey, little Dale Evans.

- que:
  - So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
  ans:
  - 702 472 1862.

- que:
  - You got it. Schmuck. All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
  ans:
  - Now this is just a signature card.

- que:
  - So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Yeah, sure I do. Why?
  ans:
  - Mommy.

- que:
  - When did this happen, honey?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
  ans:
  - He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

  - Somethin', huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
  ans:
  - Honey, come here.

- que:
  - What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
  ans:
  - No, of course not.

- que:
  - You mean, I have your permission?
  ans:
  - Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.

- que:
  - So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
  ans:
  - You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.

- que:
  - No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Then he called me a faggot.

- que:
  - All right, Ace?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - You're still eight pounds over. What's the reason for this?
  ans:
  - Between...

- que:
  - Why, somebody's complaining?
  ans:
  - That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.

- que:
  - What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

- que:
  - Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
  ans:
  - Nope, there's no way.

- que:
  - Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
  ans:
  - Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.

- que:
  - Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - You think he got the point?
  ans:
  - What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.

- que:
  - ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
  ans:
  - No, I don't wanna come -

- que:
  - You mean, quiet like this, 'I'm the boss.' That's quiet?
  ans:
  - That's all taken out of context. Okay.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.

- que:
  - What happened to me? What happened to you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I lost control?
  ans:
  - Yes, you lost your control.

- que:
  - My wife?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Now, what does she have to do with all this?
  ans:
  - Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.

- que:
  - All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.

- que:
  - And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
  ans:
  - Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.

- que:
  - It's none of my business?
  ans:
  - That's right, yeah.

- que:
  - Practice enough this week, you prick?
  ans:
  - And at the...

- que:
  - What - what, Caesar's?
  ans:
  - No, a...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Don't ask questions. Just be there.

- que:
  - What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
  ans:
  - I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.

- que:
  - Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
  ans:
  - Back -

- que:
  - And what'd she want?
  ans:
  - She was afraid to call you.

- que:
  - Yeah, uh, who's this?
  ans:
  - It's me.

- que:
  - Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not okay.

- que:
  - How'd you know I was here?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - She's there with you? She's there with you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she's here.

- que:
  - Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
  ans:
  - I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.

- que:
  - How do you do?
  ans:
  - Hey, it is my pleasure.

- que:
  - Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.

- que:
  - Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan? Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
  ans:
  - Well, that's why they paid so well.

- que:
  - Okay. You come by the house?
  ans:
  - I'll come by.

- que:
  - Seven o'clock?
  ans:
  - Seven o'clock.

- que:
  - Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
  ans:
  - They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.

- que:
  - Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
  ans:
  - Yeah, refill'd be great.

- que:
  - Well, sir, I was just...
  ans:
  - What can I do?

- que:
  - Why is she eight pounds over?
  ans:
  - ...trying to offer you the respect that your...

- que:
  - We can't get rid of him?
  ans:
  - He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

- que:
  - Why not make them happy?
  ans:
  - We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...

- que:
  - Who's this?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.

- que:
  - Right away. Okay?
  ans:
  - I-I'll do it.

- que:
  - Any change?
  ans:
  - I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.

- que:
  - What, are you trying to handicap me?
  ans:
  - You got the wrong girl, Sam.

- que:
  - You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
  ans:
  - You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? Cause I don't.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - Why're you crying?
  ans:
  - I'm not crying.

  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're kidding? My God. What is it?
  ans:
  - It's chinchilla.

- que:
  - It's nice isn't it?
  ans:
  - Oh...

- que:
  - You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
  ans:
  - You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.

- que:
  - Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
  ans:
  - Now look, pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

  ans:
  - Hi. Nice to see you.

  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - Why do you need that much?
  ans:
  - Well, what's the difference? I just need it.

  - Yeah, how do I know?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.

  ans:
  - With the money.

  - Who were you with?
  ans:
  - I was with somebody.

  ans:
  - I mean, it could get us both killed.

  - ...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
  ans:
  - It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.

- que:
  - You understand? What? Let you go?
  ans:
  - I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.

- que:
  - You want your jewelry?
  ans:
  - I want you to let me go.

- que:
  - So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
  ans:
  - You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.

- que:
  - What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
  ans:
  - In a Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several...

- que:
  - Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
  ans:
  - Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.

- que:
  - Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
  ans:
  - Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.

- que:
  - You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
  ans:
  - Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.

- que:
  - I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
  ans:
  - I really think you're -

- que:
  - That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
  ans:
  - You're firin' me?

- que:
  - I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
  ans:
  - Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.

- que:
  - Green?
  ans:
  - We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.

- que:
  - I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can't do it with both hands?
  ans:
  - No, Sir.

- que:
  - Can you do it with your left hand?
  ans:
  - Well, I... I never tried.

- que:
  - So, you're a righty?
  ans:
  - Excuse me.

- que:
  - Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
  ans:
  - I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.

- que:
  - Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
  ans:
  - I just wanna get out of here.

- que:
  - And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
  ans:
  - No, no? You didn't?

- que:
  - We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
  ans:
  - I don't want to go to Europe.

- que:
  - Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
  ans:
  - You gotta go back out there.

- que:
  - Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that works out.

- que:
  - But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
  ans:
  - You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.

- que:
  - I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No, I don't want one. Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
  ans:
  - Hi. Good.

- que:
  - What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
  ans:
  - You can't talk to me like...

- que:
  - Sam?
  ans:
  - Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal. I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.

  - Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
  ans:
  - Go get a bag, man.

- que:
  - 1 Now move along.
  ans:
  - 1 Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?

  - ...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
  ans:
  - You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?

- que:
  - Is that the last one?
  ans:
  - I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.

  ans:
  - Yeah, I heard, yeah.

- que:
  - What're you gonna do?
  ans:
  - And I mean... that's no good.

- que:
  - I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.

  ans:
  - I understand.

  - T'aggia parla.  Nicky... See that guy?
  ans:
  - Mm.

  ans:
  - Uh-huh. Good.

- que:
  - And how are things going down there?
  ans:
  - Hi, Jennifer.

- que:
  - Hi, how are you?
  ans:
  - Okay, Sammy.

- que:
  - Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Am I right?
  ans:
  - I can see that. Sure.

- que:
  - Mm, you want to steal it?
  ans:
  - No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.

- que:
  - Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
  ans:
  - I know what you mean.

- que:
  - He gives a fuck what I do?
  ans:
  - Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.

- que:
  - All right?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Thanks.

- que:
  - You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
  ans:
  - No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.

- que:
  - So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
  ans:
  - Nothin'.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You know?
  ans:
  - Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry.

- que:
  - Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he?
  ans:
  - Sure did.

- que:
  - Is that what you want?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
  ans:
  - Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
  ans:
  - It's what you want?

- que:
  - Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
  ans:
  - If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?

- que:
  - Okay, yeah.
  ans:
  - What about my money?

- que:
  - So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
  ans:
  - I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.

- que:
  - You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
  ans:
  - Well, you know...

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Get lost?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - All right.
  ans:
  - Well, how 'bout that?

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
  ans:
  - I'm always here for you.

- que:
  - Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
  ans:
  - No, Lester.

- que:
  - Do you know that?
  ans:
  - Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - God... I wish you...

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - with stupid braces on your teeth.

- que:
  - What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
  ans:
  - It means I got the money.

- que:
  - ...they're in Penthouse K.
  ans:
  - Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?

- que:
  - They check in alone?
  ans:
  - They checked in alone.

- que:
  - Are they out now?
  ans:
  - Yes, don't worry.

- que:
  - Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
  ans:
  - Wow.

- que:
  - Boy, look at this place, huh?
  ans:
  - Incredible.

- que:
  - How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
  ans:
  - Two.

- que:
  - Two?
  ans:
  - Mm-hm.

- que:
  - You know why, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause it clogs up your heart.

- que:
  - Well, how come I laid nine?
  ans:
  - Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...

- que:
  - You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What's takin' so long over there?
  ans:
  - This peter's a motherfucker.

- que:
  - What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
  ans:
  - I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

- que:
  - She asleep?
  ans:
  - Every night, on the couch.

- que:
  - Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
  ans:
  - I took care of everybody.

- que:
  - You walk past me?
  ans:
  - Hey. This is Shelly.

- que:
  - Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
  ans:
  - They're havin' a good time too.

- que:
  - Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
  ans:
  - He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

- que:
  - Yeah, what'd you tell him?
  ans:
  - I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.

- que:
  - You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
  ans:
  - Nah. You would've heard somethin'.

- que:
  - Yeah, what's to stop him?
  ans:
  - I know. I know.

- que:
  - I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

- que:
  - Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
  ans:
  - Oh, he ain't nobody.

- que:
  - Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
  ans:
  - Don't know.

- que:
  - Dominick said they're in the motel?
  ans:
  - Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.

- que:
  - Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
  ans:
  - Charlie M.

- que:
  - All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
  ans:
  - What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I'm positive.

- que:
  - You're a little confused?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Receipts and bills and... everything's here.

- que:
  - Since when do you talk like that?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
  ans:
  - I know it, I know it.

- que:
  - Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - Having a good time?
  ans:
  - Yes, uh...

- que:
  - Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland... Can I get my winnings?
  ans:
  - Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...

- que:
  - I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
  ans:
  - You have to dial nine first.

- que:
  - Have we reached the epi-center?
  ans:
  - That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.

- que:
  - In women?
  ans:
  - No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..

- que:
  - I'm not afraid. Are you?
  ans:
  - You designed Gotham Plaza? The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...

- que:
  - What did you think?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...

- que:
  - Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
  ans:
  - So, did you see \"Seinfeld\" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
  ans:
  - This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...

- que:
  - Oh, how long have you had your own route?
  ans:
  - Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect? I just love risking electrocution every time I..

- que:
  - Women, huh?
  ans:
  - They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...

- que:
  - She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
  ans:
  - I suppose she does.

- que:
  - Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
  ans:
  - You're kidding.

- que:
  - Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
  ans:
  - I can. That's not an admission of guilt, It's just..I knew you had it in you...

- que:
  - What little boy doesn't?
  ans:
  - Winning.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..

- que:
  - Even the skylight?
  ans:
  - The \"skylight?\" Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...

- que:
  - He didn't remember to roll up his window...
  ans:
  - I hate innocent bystanders. Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?

- que:
  - What's the catch?
  ans:
  - Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...

- que:
  - Car wash, Captain?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
  ans:
  - Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.

- que:
  - And...your point?
  ans:
  - Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.

- que:
  - Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
  ans:
  - Yes. I am the reporter or the architect. You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...

- que:
  - You think so?...Selina?
  ans:
  - You've seen me...

- que:
  - Men, huh?
  ans:
  - For when the time comes..

- que:
  - What's the good news?
  ans:
  - Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms. I'm not running a summer camp here..

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Enough.

- que:
  - Yes, you shouted the words \"Captain God\" at me for no reason...
  ans:
  - I thought you'd like a ride to work. You don't own a cat, do you?

- que:
  - Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
  ans:
  - Actually, yes.

- que:
  - Nothing. How's your hand?
  ans:
  - Like you don't know...

- que:
  - I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
  ans:
  - I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...

- que:
  - Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina? Selina?
  ans:
  - I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.

- que:
  - We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
  ans:
  - I'll let you know.

- que:
  - What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
  ans:
  - Okay, deal.

- que:
  - Is every single thing out of your mouth since your \"accident\" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for? Dance with me?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...

- que:
  - What's it like being a superhero? It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
  ans:
  - You seem sad, Spooky.

- que:
  - You going to talk all day?
  ans:
  - Nice breasts.

- que:
  - Where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - Any place.

- que:
  - I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay?
  ans:
  - I don't see anybody in there but you.

- que:
  - Do I hear a woman's voice?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.

- que:
  - Don't you have children?
  ans:
  - Matter of fact I did have a kid once. But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.

- que:
  - What are you doing on Theo's line?
  ans:
  - Taking messages.

- que:
  - Have you got to tell her your life story?
  ans:
  - This is my conversation. I'll say what I fucking please.

- que:
  - What if they do question the authenticity?
  ans:
  - Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.

- que:
  - Who's on the phone?
  ans:
  - I'll explain later. I'm sort of on hold.

- que:
  - What was that for?
  ans:
  - You could've made me lose my call.

- que:
  - So what? What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
  ans:
  - I didn't hurt you.

- que:
  - How was I in the wrong?
  ans:
  - I know where it is. Give me that phone back.

- que:
  - This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
  ans:
  - He's right, Theo. She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.

- que:
  - Then whose is it?
  ans:
  - You gotta just look the other way.

- que:
  - Are you guys all right?
  ans:
  - You could've killed us.

- que:
  - Why would I do that?
  ans:
  - Let's have your license, mister.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury. On the job.

- que:
  - How do we get back to the freeway?
  ans:
  - Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law. These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.

- que:
  - You switched license plates?
  ans:
  - It's taken care of.

- que:
  - What do you mean tip the cops? Is the man a lunatic or what?
  ans:
  - Will you relax? This in no way affects our business. Go on.

- que:
  - Satisfied, Wiseass?
  ans:
  - In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.

- que:
  - What do you keep making me out to be?
  ans:
  - Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.

- que:
  - What am I supposed to do?
  ans:
  - Lose the hardware now.

- que:
  - I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet?
  ans:
  - Any minute.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - I can't talk any louder. They might hear.

- que:
  - What'd you do! Just pick my number out of the air?
  ans:
  - They smashed the phone. I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.

- que:
  - Who smashed the phone?
  ans:
  - They're holding my husband downstairs.

- que:
  - They gave me pills to make me sleep. They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to do this to you.

- que:
  - Oh won't I?
  ans:
  - They tortured my husband. Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts. Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.

- que:
  - Where'd they take you to?
  ans:
  - I have no idea. They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows. The shutters up here are nailed shut.

- que:
  - Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
  ans:
  - No -- nothing.

- que:
  - I can't stay on this line. I'm picking people up. I'm already overdue. Hello?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. She's back on. Hello? I'm here.

- que:
  - What do they need her for?
  ans:
  - 26th off Wilshire.

- que:
  - Why isn't anyone answering me?
  ans:
  - Just hang on. I've got a life of my own.

- que:
  - Will you please speak to me! Theo?
  ans:
  - Another minute.

- que:
  - What about the others?
  ans:
  - I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves.

- que:
  - What are you doing now?
  ans:
  - What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.

- que:
  - How much time do you have left on it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops.

- que:
  - Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.

- que:
  - Hey drop it, okay?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.

- que:
  - And that was the end of it?
  ans:
  - I sure as hell got my wish. She doesn't exist. So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.

- que:
  - What do you do for a living?
  ans:
  - Sometimes I paint.

- que:
  - You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Theo?
  ans:
  - There are cables overhead. Hang on. It'll clear up.

- que:
  - Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
  ans:
  - That's not her.

- que:
  - Does she wear glasses?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
  ans:
  - What's happening?

- que:
  - You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
  ans:
  - The one in Brentwood.

- que:
  - What bank?
  ans:
  - The City National on San Vincente.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Black Mercedes, 600S.

- que:
  - I'm not doing too well. What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.

- que:
  - Even if you found us -- what then?
  ans:
  - I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood. That bank is our best bet. If anybody shows up I could follow them.

- que:
  - Do you know what's in that box?
  ans:
  - I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.

- que:
  - You're doing what you can. Why's all this money stashed?
  ans:
  - To hide it from the I.R.S.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - The front door slammed. Someone went out. There's a different car starting.

- que:
  - I might still get there first. The lights are with me. How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
  ans:
  - It won't be him.

- que:
  - But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
  ans:
  - I've got a lot of respect for you too. For the way you feel about your family.

- que:
  - Why tell me this?
  ans:
  - Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.

- que:
  - Did you jiggle the phone?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Try what you did before. It worked before. I won't talk anymore.
  ans:
  - Did you hear that click?

- que:
  - Hi Lenore. It's me. I got you back. Courtesy of Star 69. Are you hurt?
  ans:
  - They dragged me downstairs. I thought they were going to kill me.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.

- que:
  - That's coming off. How about the girl?
  ans:
  - She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.

- que:
  - You're all three of you in that van?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can you walk?
  ans:
  - Yes. But I want Rachel to come with me.

- que:
  - Why can't it be her?
  ans:
  - She's a child. She might panic. She doesn't know me. She might not come to me. She might just run.

- que:
  - Why didn't you just shoot them?
  ans:
  - Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones.

- que:
  - You're going to let them get away with this?
  ans:
  - We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas.

- que:
  - They tortured us. And you're going to let them have all that money?
  ans:
  - So far they're keeping their part of it.

- que:
  - Somehow I got along better with you on the phone. It's all there isn't it?
  ans:
  - Hand me the phone.

- que:
  - The rest of the money is here in the car. Why don't you come and get it?
  ans:
  - You're not Lenore Oberfeld.

- que:
  - It belongs to the man you took it from. Or should I saw stole it from?
  ans:
  - The guy with the transplant.

- que:
  - Jack Oberfeld in person. Did you kill him?
  ans:
  - Damned if I know.

- que:
  - Who's in back?
  ans:
  - L.A.P.D.

- que:
  - Not all. They already have a third. The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
  ans:
  - You won't shoot me. That's not your style.

- que:
  - Do you have to point that?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to me?
  ans:
  - I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.

- que:
  - You were at the Emerald that night?
  ans:
  - Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.

- que:
  - Did you hear that?
  ans:
  - Let me talk to him. Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.

- que:
  - What's Nels' number?
  ans:
  - 259-7881.

- que:
  - Do you think they'll walk away?
  ans:
  - Ask them.

- que:
  - I can't hear. Now there's a siren. They must be in an ambulance. What about the money? Nels?
  ans:
  - Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.

- que:
  - Any idea where you're going?
  ans:
  - I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen. We cleared some of these same roads.

- que:
  - Think you could do a picture of me?
  ans:
  - I had it in my mind what you'd look like. \"Her,\" I could've painted. You, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.

- que:
  - Why are we stopping?
  ans:
  - I need a break. I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.

- que:
  - You've had a lot of fun with me today. What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
  ans:
  - The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.

- que:
  - What's your point?
  ans:
  - We can't leave him to repeat anything.

- que:
  - Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
  ans:
  - You're the man with the gun.

- que:
  - Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
  ans:
  - Local lawyer for Dominican dealers. Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.

- que:
  - Know what else is in here?
  ans:
  - Take your hand out of there. Slowly.

- que:
  - Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
  ans:
  - You won't live to see it.

- que:
  - I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
  ans:
  - Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - You mustn't hang up.

- que:
  - I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
  ans:
  - Didn't we play this scene before?

- que:
  - I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
  ans:
  - Twenty percent.

- que:
  - You're up on your details, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Keep talking.

- que:
  - It's a nice day. How about the beach?
  ans:
  - Pass.

- que:
  - It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
  ans:
  - We can be there.

- que:
  - Got a phone in that van?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - I'm here. Where are you?
  ans:
  - We don't see you.

- que:
  - Satisfied?
  ans:
  - You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.

- que:
  - And then?
  ans:
  - And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.

- que:
  - Are you trying to panic the women?
  ans:
  - That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one.

- que:
  - I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
  ans:
  - Stop the crying.

- que:
  - She's yours. What are we waiting on?
  ans:
  - I'm backing up.

- que:
  - Yeah. Why don't we?
  ans:
  - What are you planning to do when they got here? They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.

- que:
  - Tailgate me. I'll jam on the brakes. You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
  ans:
  - Who am I talking to?

- que:
  - You want us to get ourselves killed?
  ans:
  - I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave.

- que:
  - Who's this?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd know me by now.

- que:
  - Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
  ans:
  - Intelligent question, Nels. I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.

- que:
  - You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
  ans:
  - That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off?

- que:
  - Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds. I may need to pry that information out of her. What do you stand to gain?
  ans:
  - Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.

- que:
  - How far off are you?
  ans:
  - Five minutes.

- que:
  - Where do I turn?
  ans:
  - Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment.

- que:
  - Where's the backpack?
  ans:
  - None of your business, but it's in the cab. That's all mine. When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.

- que:
  - Are you busting my chops or what?
  ans:
  - Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.

- que:
  - Who were you talking to?
  ans:
  - Them. They won't be expecting us.

- que:
  - Since when did you guys start changing tires?
  ans:
  - Only you don't have a flat.

- que:
  - If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
  ans:
  - Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.

- que:
  - Was I picking on you? How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
  ans:
  - Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Let me talk to the lady again.

- que:
  - Government business?
  ans:
  - Very official. 259-7881, if I recall.

- que:
  - What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
  ans:
  - Undercover.

- que:
  - Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
  ans:
  - Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.

- que:
  - Scottish?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is that good or bad?
  ans:
  - Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.

- que:
  - So who's he?
  ans:
  - He's what she should run a mile from.

- que:
  - Then why doesn't she?
  ans:
  - Who knows the secrets of the human heart.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.

- que:
  - See what, Dil?
  ans:
  - He gave me a look.

- que:
  - Did he?
  ans:
  - Just cut his hair, you know.

- que:
  - What you think?
  ans:
  - Nice.

- que:
  - What would you call it?
  ans:
  - Now, that was a look.

- que:
  - What do you think his name is?
  ans:
  - I've no thoughts on the subject.

- que:
  - You see that, Col?
  ans:
  - Saw it, Dil.

- que:
  - Did I?
  ans:
  - You fucking did.

- que:
  - Who the fuck is he?
  ans:
  - Jimmy.

- que:
  - It's him, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
  ans:
  - Cunt.

- que:
  - Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - It's not Pat. It's Jim.

- que:
  - Do you mean that?
  ans:
  - He wants to know do I mean that.

- que:
  - Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
  ans:
  - She's not a tart.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Whatever it is she does for you.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - It's a simple question.

- que:
  - How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
  ans:
  - Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

- que:
  - Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
  ans:
  - Not in my experience.

- que:
  - Someone recommend you?
  ans:
  - In a way.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Guy I work with.

- que:
  - What's it to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You American?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How'd you guess?
  ans:
  - The accent, I suppose.

- que:
  - And what's it like?
  ans:
  - Like treacle.

- que:
  - Don't know. Who is she?
  ans:
  - Tell her I'm very happy with it.

- que:
  - Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Everybody wants something.

- que:
  - You old-fashioned?
  ans:
  - Must be.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - They all get the wrong idea.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you.

- que:
  - What was that all about?
  ans:
  - He wants me to perform for him.

- que:
  - Perform?
  ans:
  - You know.

- que:
  - You on the game?
  ans:
  - God no. I'm a hairdresser.

- que:
  - Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
  ans:
  - You can't leave me then, can you?

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Half-five. At Millie's.

- que:
  - What look?
  ans:
  - The one you gave me in the Metro.

- que:
  - What's that about?
  ans:
  - They're jealous.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I wonder.

- que:
  - Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
  ans:
  - Must be.

- que:
  - Jesus.
  ans:
  - You got a special friend, Jimmy?

- que:
  - That Dave?
  ans:
  - Yes, please.

- que:
  - What'll it be?
  ans:
  - Whiskey.

- que:
  - Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
  ans:
  - Must be in love to manage that.

- que:
  - Tried to. Sit down, will you?
  ans:
  - He was different.

- que:
  - How different?
  ans:
  - As different as it's possible to be.

- que:
  - Shouldn't I go?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Are you jealous of him?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What would he think?
  ans:
  - Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think you do.

- que:
  - Do I?
  ans:
  - Like you're concerned.

- que:
  - But you can t stay, you know that?
  ans:
  - Didn't think I could.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you be in mourning?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - Is this an obsession of yours?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Want to look after you.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Something I heard someone say once.

- que:
  - You mean that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - I'm superstitious. Drink.

- que:
  - The thing is, can you go the distance?
  ans:
  - Depends what it is.

- que:
  - What you thinking of, hon?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking of your man.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm wondering why you keep his things.

- que:
  - Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
  ans:
  - Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.

- que:
  - What you doing here?
  ans:
  - Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.

- que:
  - You're something else, Dil, you know that?
  ans:
  - Never said a truer word.

- que:
  - Do you care, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Sure I do.

- que:
  - You mean that?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I care, Dil.

- que:
  - You think that's wise?
  ans:
  - Nothing's wise.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Ask to meet me again.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Whenever. Tonight.

- que:
  - Know what, honey?
  ans:
  - Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.

- que:
  - I should have known, shouldn't I?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Are you pretending yet?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it.

- que:
  - Am I becoming repetitious?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - Happy now?
  ans:
  - Delirious.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He'd bring me carnations.

- que:
  - You gonna tell me why?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - She from Scotland too?
  ans:
  - You could say that.

- que:
  - And you're not going to tell me more?
  ans:
  - I can't.

- que:
  - What you doing, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Do you like me even a little bit?
  ans:
  - More than that.

- que:
  - You do something for me, Dil?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - You'd do anything for me?
  ans:
  - Afraid so.

- que:
  - You want another haircut, baby?
  ans:
  - No. Sit down.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's a secret.

- que:
  - You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you wouldn't leave me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You promise?
  ans:
  - I promise.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - For me.

- que:
  - Why are we going here, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Look on it like a honeymoon.

- que:
  - You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
  ans:
  - Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?

- que:
  - You mean that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You heard what I said, Dil?
  ans:
  - My pills...

- que:
  - What pills?
  ans:
  - Prescription. For my condition.

- que:
  - Are you supposed to take that many?
  ans:
  - Only in times of extreme stress.

- que:
  - Are you all right, Dil?
  ans:
  - Don't go like that.

- que:
  - You knew which man?
  ans:
  - Your soldier.

- que:
  - You knew my Jody?
  ans:
  - Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.

- que:
  - Are you listening?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You killed my Jody?
  ans:
  - In a manner of speaking.

- que:
  - Don't you want to kill me?
  ans:
  - Got to be somewhere.

- que:
  - Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
  ans:
  - You like me now, Jimmy?

- que:
  - More what?
  ans:
  - More endearments.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What would you do for me?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - And you'll never leave me?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - What was that she called you, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Fergus.

- que:
  - And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
  ans:
  - Yes. Now.

- que:
  - Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Not if you go.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - I promise.

- que:
  - Where am I to go, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - The Metro.

- que:
  - As the man said, it's in my nature.
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Lucky you.

- que:
  - Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.

- que:
  - A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - You'll notice I've asked you nothing.

- que:
  - So what do you need, Fergus?
  ans:
  - Need to go across the water.

- que:
  - Hey -- what's he like?
  ans:
  - Horny bastard.

- que:
  - Did you give him it?
  ans:
  - There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.

- que:
  - What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
  ans:
  - Leave me alone, Jude.

- que:
  - Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
  ans:
  - Suits you.

- que:
  - No, what is the thing?
  ans:
  - You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.

- que:
  - And then you'll leave her out of it?
  ans:
  - Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

- que:
  - And what if I say no?
  ans:
  - You know what. Go.

- que:
  - Was I?
  ans:
  - Perfect.

- que:
  - And what happens then?
  ans:
  - We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.

- que:
  - And what if you don't?
  ans:
  - Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

- que:
  - Who's the old geezer?
  ans:
  - Some judge...

- que:
  - You a handyman, Fergie?
  ans:
  - I take pride in my work.

- que:
  - Do you want a cup of tea?
  ans:
  - Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.

- que:
  - Why would you do that?
  ans:
  - The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - And anyway, he's seen our faces.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.

- que:
  - What the fuck is this?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.

- que:
  - So he knows your name?
  ans:
  - I told him.

- que:
  - You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.

- que:
  - I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
  ans:
  - Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.

- que:
  - Why do you want to do that for?
  ans:
  - Would make me feel better about it.

- que:
  - You sure about that?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - Who'd you think it was?
  ans:
  - I thought it was Dave.

- que:
  - And who's Dave when he's at home?
  ans:
  - He's at home.

- que:
  - Should blow you away, you know that?
  ans:
  - I know that.

- que:
  - I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
  ans:
  - Definitely unusual.

- que:
  - And who is she?
  ans:
  - Just a girl.

- que:
  - And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
  ans:
  - Aye, I do, Peter.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.

- que:
  - You being cynical, Hennessy?
  ans:
  - Hope not.

- que:
  - Good. So what do you think?
  ans:
  - Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.

- que:
  - Kind of suicide, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Fuck you.

- que:
  - Eat something, would you?
  ans:
  - Can't.

- que:
  - What do you mean you can't?
  ans:
  - Can't eat through a canvas bag.

- que:
  - How is it a farce?
  ans:
  - I seen your fucking face.

- que:
  - So, what do I look like?
  ans:
  - You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.

- que:
  - Am I?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And the brown eyes.

- que:
  - How did you know it was her?
  ans:
  - I can smell her perfume.

- que:
  - Can't we take it off?
  ans:
  - Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - Nope. Not handsome at all.

- que:
  - You trying to hurt my feelings?
  ans:
  - No. It's the truth.

- que:
  - Could you?
  ans:
  - Kill me.

- que:
  - What makes you think that?
  ans:
  - They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.

- que:
  - You want to bet?
  ans:
  - I'm not a gambling man.

- que:
  - Why can't we?
  ans:
  - Not in your nature.

- que:
  - What do you know about my nature?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about your people, not you.

- que:
  - What the fuck do you know about my people?
  ans:
  - Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.

- que:
  - No, what's the funny thing?
  ans:
  - I didn't even fancy her.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My inside pocket.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not.

- que:
  - She your wife?
  ans:
  - Suppose you could say that.

- que:
  - She's a friend of mine
  ans:
  - So what were you fucking around for, then?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - What the fuck am I doing here.

- que:
  - What the fuck were you doing here?
  ans:
  - I got sent.

- que:
  - Why did you sign up?
  ans:
  - It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.

- que:
  - That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
  ans:
  - Best game in the world.

- que:
  - How different?
  ans:
  - Toffs' game there. But not at home. .

- que:
  - Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
  ans:
  - Now, that was worth waiting for.

- que:
  - Hurry up, would you?
  ans:
  - These things take time, Fergus.

- que:
  - Shut up, would you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

- que:
  - So what's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

- que:
  - Where would you most like to be now, man?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter where.

- que:
  - Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
  ans:
  - Like what?

- que:
  - Who's Dil?
  ans:
  - My special friend.

- que:
  - Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
  ans:
  - We don't look on it like that.

- que:
  - What do you believe in?
  ans:
  - That you guys shouldn't be here.

- que:
  - It's as simple as that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
  ans:
  - I didn't.

- que:
  - Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
  ans:
  - Don't know her.

- que:
  - Help me.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - How can I?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A story.

- que:
  - Like the one about the frog?
  ans:
  - And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
  ans:
  - Me? No, I'm not good for much...

- que:
  - Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
  ans:
  - The fastest.

- que:
  - Faster than cricket?
  ans:
  - Cricket's in the halfpenny place.

- que:
  - So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
  ans:
  - No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.

- que:
  - What if I did?
  ans:
  - You'd know I wouldn't run off.

- que:
  - Nice lady.
  ans:
  - You didn't?

- que:
  - Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
  ans:
  - Have you no feelings, woman?

- que:
  - Give me the fucking shooter!
  ans:
  - That true, Fergus? You in love?

- que:
  - Where are you, ol' buddy?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you.

- que:
  - All right -- where's the letter?
  ans:
  - The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.

- que:
  - How was I leading you on?
  ans:
  - No -- I guess not.

- que:
  - Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
  ans:
  - Oh, you should see your face.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - It's lovely.

- que:
  - You don't look so bad in this light.
  ans:
  - What's the matter?

- que:
  - Why do you think I brought you here?
  ans:
  - I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.

- que:
  - Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
  ans:
  - No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.

- que:
  - There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
  ans:
  - You're going to look for him -- now?

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Open up.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Lord, you're stubborn.

- que:
  - Can you remember anything at all?
  ans:
  - Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.

- que:
  - Of course there is!
  ans:
  - Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.

- que:
  - Tex? You mean he's here, too?
  ans:
  - Look.

- que:
  - Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
  ans:
  - There's not a reason on earth why you should.

- que:
  - I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
  ans:
  - And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.

- que:
  - What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

- que:
  - Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
  ans:
  - Charles Lampert's widow -- yes? Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.

- que:
  - I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
  ans:
  - Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.

- que:
  - You mean spies and things like that?
  ans:
  - Only we call them agents.

- que:
  - Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
  ans:
  - We? You mean you're --?

- que:
  - What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
  ans:
  - Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.

- que:
  - May I have a sandwich, please?
  ans:
  - To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.

- que:
  - His -- real -- ?
  ans:
  - Very sweet.

- que:
  - Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
  ans:
  - You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.

- que:
  - Then whose is it? His or theirs?
  ans:
  - Ours.

- que:
  - Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, where? -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.

- que:
  - Were you followed?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Dyle, or whatever his name is.

- que:
  - What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
  ans:
  - He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

- que:
  - No, what?
  ans:
  - That's not Carson Dyle.

- que:
  - Carson?
  ans:
  - There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.

- que:
  - Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
  ans:
  - I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.

- que:
  - I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
  ans:
  - Barely, yes.

- que:
  - Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
  ans:
  - Can I at least keep the onion soup?

- que:
  - Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
  ans:
  - May I have a cigarette, please?

- que:
  - But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
  ans:
  - We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.

- que:
  - But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
  ans:
  - C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.

- que:
  - Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

- que:
  - Me? Why me?
  ans:
  - You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you. Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.

- que:
  - Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
  ans:
  - Yes -- ?

- que:
  - Are you sure there's no mistake?
  ans:
  - None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.

- que:
  - Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.

- que:
  - He looks so young -- when was this taken?
  ans:
  - 1944. The next face, please.

- que:
  - Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
  ans:
  - No, thank heaven.

- que:
  - When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
  ans:
  - Around one.

- que:
  - Bartholomew?
  ans:
  - -- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.

- que:
  - What's your first name today?
  ans:
  - Brian.

- que:
  - Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - But you're -- divorced?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
  ans:
  - You'll wreck your raincoat.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - We wait -- with our mouths shut.

- que:
  - How long do you intend -- ?
  ans:
  - I said with the mouth shut.

- que:
  - Do I knock or something?
  ans:
  - Open it.

- que:
  - I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
  ans:
  - Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.

- que:
  - Back where?
  ans:
  - That's the idea.

- que:
  - Then who does?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.

- que:
  - That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
  ans:
  - Me?

- que:
  - Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
  ans:
  - He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?

- que:
  - No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - Why you lied to me.

- que:
  - Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- What happened?
  ans:
  - I met a man with sharp nails.

- que:
  - Scobie?
  ans:
  - I left him hanging around the American Express.

- que:
  - Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
  ans:
  - Yes, but we're divorced.

- que:
  - Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
  ans:
  - You can't.

- que:
  - Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
  ans:
  - Because he's wearing moccasins.

- que:
  - Which one are you?
  ans:
  - Whitefoot, of course.

- que:
  - Why can't you be serious?
  ans:
  - There, you said it.

- que:
  - Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
  ans:
  - Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Cutting it out.

- que:
  - Who told you to do that?
  ans:
  - You did.

- que:
  - What day is it?
  ans:
  - Tuesday.

- que:
  - Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
  ans:
  - Scobie -- he's the one that objected.

- que:
  - Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - Or Tex?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
  ans:
  - I think Tex did it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.

- que:
  - What's so illogical about that?
  ans:
  - Oh. I guess they just can't help it.

- que:
  - What -- like Scobie?
  ans:
  - I'm scared.

- que:
  - Got you.
  ans:
  - What? Assassinate somebody?

- que:
  - Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
  ans:
  - The shower's in there.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on? What a nut.

- que:
  - The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
  ans:
  - I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?

- que:
  - How often do you go through this little ritual?
  ans:
  - Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.

- que:
  - I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
  ans:
  - Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.

- que:
  - What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
  ans:
  - It's a start, anyway.

- que:
  - I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
  ans:
  - I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.

- que:
  - Are you going to listen?
  ans:
  - Go on.

- que:
  - I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
  ans:
  - It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.

- que:
  - You mean, you're a thief?
  ans:
  - I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.

- que:
  - Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
  ans:
  - I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.

- que:
  - How much is it worth?
  ans:
  - The money is unimportant.

- que:
  - In human life? In greed? In suffering?
  ans:
  - In money.

- que:
  - Do you have anything to eat? And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
  ans:
  - A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.

- que:
  - You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
  ans:
  - Here's ten.

- que:
  - You sure nuthin's missin'?
  ans:
  - No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.

- que:
  - Meaning what?
  ans:
  - You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.

- que:
  - It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - I don't know anything.

- que:
  - You loved him?
  ans:
  - I'm very cold.

- que:
  - Leave?
  ans:
  - Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.

- que:
  - He was American?
  ans:
  - Swiss.

- que:
  - Oh. Swiss. His profession?
  ans:
  - He didn't have one.

- que:
  - He was a wealthy man?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I suppose so.

- que:
  - About how wealthy would you say?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where did he keep his money?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Is it all right?
  ans:
  - I wish you wouldn't.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.

- que:
  - One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
  ans:
  - Of course it is.

- que:
  - And this?
  ans:
  - I don't understand.

- que:
  - And this? And this?
  ans:
  - I was, too.

- que:
  - In Mr. Dyle's room?
  ans:
  - No -- in my room.

- que:
  - It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
  ans:
  - I know. I would bury it in the garden.

- que:
  - Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! What's that?
  ans:
  - A man traded with me -- all those for only four.

- que:
  - Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis -- where?
  ans:
  - But he is gone.

- que:
  - I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
  ans:
  - No -- but I will ask.

- que:
  - I don't know -- how would I know?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

- que:
  - You give up awfully easy, don't you?
  ans:
  - Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

- que:
  - The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Peter Joshua.

- que:
  - Is there a Mr. Lampert?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
  ans:
  - Yes, but we're divorced.

- que:
  - Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
  ans:
  - Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.

- que:
  - Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said, \"When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again\"?
  ans:
  - Shakespeare never said that.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - It's terrible -- you just made it up.

- que:
  - Are you in the book?
  ans:
  - Charles is.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.

- que:
  - How did you find out?
  ans:
  - It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.

- que:
  - Where did everything go?
  ans:
  - Charles sold it all -- at auction.

- que:
  - Do you know what you're going to do?
  ans:
  - Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.

- que:
  - Instant divorce you mean?
  ans:
  - Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.

- que:
  - Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
  ans:
  - Hallo, Peter.

- que:
  - Don't you understand French?
  ans:
  - I'm still having trouble with English.

- que:
  - What was all that?
  ans:
  - Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.

- que:
  - Lay on, MacDuff.
  ans:
  - You mean you and me?

- que:
  - What are you doing in here?
  ans:
  - Having a nervous breakdown.

- que:
  - You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
  ans:
  - I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.

- que:
  - Who said?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm not supposed to say.

- que:
  - What was what?
  ans:
  - We're here.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - On the street where you live.

- que:
  - How would you like a spanking?
  ans:
  - How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Good night.

- que:
  - I think I sprained my pride. Where'd he go?
  ans:
  - Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A quarter of a million dollars.

- que:
  - No, it isn't -- where's the money?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.

- que:
  - Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
  ans:
  - Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - The man you had the fight with.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

- que:
  - Wha -- what do you want?
  ans:
  - Va jouer, mon ange.

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.

- que:
  - But why do you want a divorce?
  ans:
  - Because I don't love him.

- que:
  - Don't you want me to stay?
  ans:
  - It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.

- que:
  - Didn't Charles have any friends?
  ans:
  - Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.

- que:
  - Have you no idea who could have done it?
  ans:
  - Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.

- que:
  - Do you know him?
  ans:
  - I've never seen him before.

- que:
  - How can you tell?
  ans:
  - He's allergic to him.

- que:
  - Who is it from?
  ans:
  - The American Embassy.

- que:
  - What is it about?
  ans:
  - Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.

- que:
  - What's he up to?
  ans:
  - He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.

- que:
  - Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
  ans:
  - I'm glad. But what's all this?

- que:
  - Yeah? What's that?
  ans:
  - He took care of Charlie for us.

- que:
  - Who invited you?
  ans:
  - I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.

- que:
  - I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
  ans:
  - What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.

- que:
  - If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
  ans:
  - As fucking if.

- que:
  - WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
  ans:
  - Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.

- que:
  - That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
  ans:
  - She's my daughter, Tom.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.

- que:
  - Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
  ans:
  - If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.

- que:
  - is there anything you do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.

- que:
  - How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
  ans:
  - I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.

- que:
  - Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
  ans:
  - No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.

- que:
  - I will. Is that all?
  ans:
  - Hi honey.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I have a question to ask you. A personal question.

- que:
  - Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
  ans:
  - Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.

- que:
  - I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - Not much further.
  ans:
  - How much further?

- que:
  - You never went, uh, all the way?
  ans:
  - Ok.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.

- que:
  - You know her?
  ans:
  - It can't be.

- que:
  - Who is she Daddy?
  ans:
  - Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.

- que:
  - What did you hear?
  ans:
  - The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.

- que:
  - You found her?
  ans:
  - There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - We're seeing all the signs in town.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.

- que:
  - Is Jody still awake?
  ans:
  - She just turned off her light.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - She's still a virgin.

- que:
  - Did you warn her?
  ans:
  - No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - This will relax her.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.

- que:
  - You know where I can find her?
  ans:
  - St. Michael's.

- que:
  - She works at a church?
  ans:
  - She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - A bullet to the right cerebellum.

- que:
  - She was murdered?
  ans:
  - No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.

- que:
  - Can you describe her? How old was she?
  ans:
  - I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.

- que:
  - Can you get inside?
  ans:
  - I can.

- que:
  - No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
  ans:
  - No, you couldn't.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You should check downstairs.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Your brother told us.

- que:
  - You're not?
  ans:
  - No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.

- que:
  - Jesus. Any word from Brent?
  ans:
  - Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.

- que:
  - But I shouldn't shut it down?
  ans:
  - No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You gave me a 'D'.

- que:
  - Can you just follow me? The back is full?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - of COURSE. You're not scared?
  ans:
  - Of course I'm scared.

- que:
  - You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
  ans:
  - I really do. For your own safety.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.

- que:
  - Me? Why me?
  ans:
  - Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.

- que:
  - What do you know about my father?
  ans:
  - He's a rapist. Like mine.

- que:
  - Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You think you're my sister?
  ans:
  - Go sit next to him.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Mark Shale.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.

- que:
  - Does she fuck?
  ans:
  - I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Mark invited me to the party.

- que:
  - Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
  ans:
  - Unless he makes a move during seventh period.

- que:
  - Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
  ans:
  - I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.

- que:
  - Stag?
  ans:
  - Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.

- que:
  - They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
  ans:
  - Twenty eight years ago.

- que:
  - You heard about that?
  ans:
  - Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.

- que:
  - Don't you think it's sick?
  ans:
  - Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.

- que:
  - Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.

- que:
  - Are you O.K.?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I think it's really sick.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.

- que:
  - Did Sharon say no?
  ans:
  - You know I want to go with you.

- que:
  - So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I kind of am.

- que:
  - Are you coming to the party?
  ans:
  - Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.

- que:
  - What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
  ans:
  - Just making me feel like a piece of meat.

- que:
  - I'm making you feel like meat?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Pretend we're just another couple.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I need to ask you something.

- que:
  - Yeah. Who is she?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Where did you hear that name.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's what he said.

- que:
  - Did he say anything else about her?
  ans:
  - No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - The library. I'll be fine.

- que:
  - Who is she?
  ans:
  - She's nobody you should be concerned with.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.

- que:
  - Attacked how?
  ans:
  - She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.

- que:
  - You didn't believe her?
  ans:
  - No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.

- que:
  - And the police did nothing?
  ans:
  - EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.

- que:
  - How could you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.

- que:
  - The men. Do any of them still live around here?
  ans:
  - Two men left town right after it happened.

- que:
  - The principal?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who was the fourth?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Kenny's aunt?
  ans:
  - Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.

- que:
  - On what side of the family?
  ans:
  - His mother's side.

- que:
  - You ok?
  ans:
  - Just thinking about something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I got to go.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm worried about someone.

- que:
  - And she didn't?
  ans:
  - Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.

- que:
  - Did you want one?
  ans:
  - Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.

- que:
  - Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.

- que:
  - What, do you work for my boss, dog?
  ans:
  - Okay, okay.

  - INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.

  ans:
  - Freezer in the back.

- que:
  - Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
  ans:
  - Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars. And we need that in cash.

- que:
  - ...Darlene pay you in cash?
  ans:
  - Since today. New policy.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

- que:
  - Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
  ans:
  - Well, he told me to collect cash.

- que:
  - Uh, huh?
  ans:
  - Except for the fact that I need cash.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies. I could always give you that.

- que:
  - Why don't I--?
  ans:
  - No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.

- que:
  - What did I say?
  ans:
  - Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

  - Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey. We are heroes, my man. It's time to start actin' like it.
  ans:
  - We're the shit. Bigtime.

- que:
  - Who drove the ice cream...
  ans:
  - Stop limpin' around like that.

- que:
  - Who had to put a gun to your head?
  ans:
  - Who put the big hurt on...

  - ...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
  ans:
  - You, Arlo.

  - And where are you going?
  ans:
  - After that re-...

  - Excellent.
  ans:
  - Hey, doc. Might wanna...

- que:
  - Been trying to figure out your secret.
  ans:
  - Been trying to figure out your secret.

- que:
  - My secret?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less...

- que:
  - How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
  ans:
  - Call an ambulance.

- que:
  - Cold? Cold. How cold?
  ans:
  - Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.

- que:
  - And what if it does?
  ans:
  - Well, Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.

- que:
  - I don't know. Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
  ans:
  - We don't have an hour. We're already supposed to be shut down.

- que:
  - ...you, Mason?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah...

  - I'm at mile marker...

- que:
  - Got that?
  ans:
  - So you don't remember...

- que:
  - Lying?
  ans:
  - Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you. We've got your whole record. We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...

- que:
  - What happened to Colonel Brynner?
  ans:
  - The Army, sealin' us in.

- que:
  - Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
  ans:
  - Take it easy, Jake.

- que:
  - How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
  ans:
  - Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.

- que:
  - Then these are all new owners?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Can I check one of these volumes out?
  ans:
  - Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.

- que:
  - A ruler?
  ans:
  - The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I said horseshit. Horseshit.

- que:
  - Always?
  ans:
  - You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.

- que:
  - How did she get that idea?
  ans:
  - I think I gave it to her.

- que:
  - Tell me. What do the police say?
  ans:
  - They're calling it an accident.

- que:
  - Who's the investigating officer?
  ans:
  - Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.

- que:
  - Do you know him?
  ans:
  - Oh yes.

- que:
  - Where from?
  ans:
  - We worked in Chinatown together.

- que:
  - Would you call him a capable man?
  ans:
  - Very.

- que:
  - Honest?
  ans:
  - Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.

- que:
  - Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
  ans:
  - None.

- que:
  - Too bad?
  ans:
  - My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.

- que:
  - Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
  ans:
  - If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.

- que:
  - Why is that funny?
  ans:
  - It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.

- que:
  - ...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
  ans:
  - Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.

- que:
  - His girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Yes, his girlfriend.

- que:
  - Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Doesn't that strike you as odd?
  ans:
  - No. She's probably scared to death.

- que:
  - Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When was the last time?
  ans:
  - Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.

- que:
  - Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
  ans:
  - At my age, you tend to lose track...

- que:
  - I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
  ans:
  - My daughter.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.

- que:
  - How did you find out?
  ans:
  - I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.

- que:
  - Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
  ans:
  - Just find the girl.

- que:
  - Avocado groves?
  ans:
  - We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

- que:
  - Is she all right?
  ans:
  - She's fine.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - With her mother.

- que:
  - An obituary column... can you read in this light?
  ans:
  - Yes... I think I can manage...

- que:
  - What does this mean?
  ans:
  - That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

- que:
  - Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
  ans:
  - Haven't the faintest idea.

- que:
  - And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
  ans:
  - There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.

- que:
  - How do you do that?
  ans:
  - Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.

- que:
  - I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
  ans:
  - Oh, my, yes.

- que:
  - Who do you blame for that? Her?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
  ans:
  - Either that or she'll be in jail.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Just bring your checkbook.

- que:
  - What's that, Curly?
  ans:
  - I think I'll kill her.

- que:
  - Oh they don't?
  ans:
  - Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.

- que:
  - What kind of guy do you think I am?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

- que:
  - Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Curly, where's your car?
  ans:
  - In the garage.

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - Off the alley.

- que:
  - Could you drive me somewhere?
  ans:
  - Sure, as soon as we eat.

- que:
  - How much do you owe me, Curly?
  ans:
  - Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.

- que:
  - Plus what I owe you?
  ans:
  - I'll throw that in too.

- que:
  - You sure this is okay?
  ans:
  - Curly, you know how long I been in business.

- que:
  - Then what'll you do?
  ans:
  - Sue the shit out of 'em.

- que:
  - Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
  ans:
  - I'm not.

- que:
  - Where did you get this material?
  ans:
  - The apple core club.

- que:
  - The apple core?
  ans:
  - No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - Hello, Jake.

- que:
  - How are you, Lou?
  ans:
  - I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.

- que:
  - How'd you get past the guards?
  ans:
  - Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.

- que:
  - Since when?
  ans:
  - Since I made Lieutenant.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Looking for someone.

- que:
  - Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
  ans:
  - Oh yes.

- que:
  - Or her name?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No. It was an accident.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
  ans:
  - When I do, you'll hear about it.

- que:
  - How do you happen to know her?
  ans:
  - I don't.

- que:
  - Isn't that your number?
  ans:
  - Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.

- que:
  - You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
  ans:
  - I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.

- que:
  - What pictures?
  ans:
  - This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.

- que:
  - You accusing me of extortion?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - And why's that?
  ans:
  - He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - C'mon I'll show you.

- que:
  - Too late for what?
  ans:
  - They only dump the water at night.

- que:
  - I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
  ans:
  - Matter of fact I do.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.

- que:
  - What's the maid's address?
  ans:
  - She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You never learn, do you, Gittes?
  ans:
  - I guess not.

- que:
  - Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
  ans:
  - An accident?

- que:
  - It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You and your husband never discussed her?
  ans:
  - He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.

- que:
  - A complete surprise?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - A private investigator?
  ans:
  - Mr. Gittes.

- que:
  - Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.

- que:
  - Not that Mulwray?
  ans:
  - Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...

- que:
  - What are you having?
  ans:
  - Iced tea.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I said I'll drop it.

- que:
  - Yes, Mr. Gittes?
  ans:
  - I don't want to drop it.

- que:
  - May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
  ans:
  - You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

- que:
  - It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
  ans:
  - No. I went riding rather early.

- que:
  - A check?
  ans:
  - I got your check in the mall.

- que:
  - Well, how much would you like?
  ans:
  - Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.

- que:
  - I have?
  ans:
  - I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.

- que:
  - How did you find out?
  ans:
  - My husband.

- que:
  - And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
  ans:
  - I was grateful.

- que:
  - Unless what?
  ans:
  - Mr. Gittes.

- que:
  - Did he know?
  ans:
  - Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.

- que:
  - Is there anything else you want to know?
  ans:
  - Where you were when your husband died.

- que:
  - You mean you don't know where you were?
  ans:
  - I mean I can't tell you.

- que:
  - For very long?
  ans:
  - K... Cross.

- que:
  - Yes... why?
  ans:
  - No reason.

- que:
  - How did it happen?
  ans:
  - Been meaning to talk to you about that.

- que:
  - Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
  ans:
  - More like other people putting their business in my nose.

- que:
  - Another satisfied client?
  ans:
  - Another satisfied client's wife.

- que:
  - Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
  ans:
  - Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.

- que:
  - Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.

- que:
  - So you married your father's business partner?
  ans:
  - You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

- que:
  - Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
  ans:
  - No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...

- que:
  - Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
  ans:
  - Then it was over the water department.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - Yes. He never forgave him for it.

- que:
  - Never forgave him for what?
  ans:
  - For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.

- que:
  - You sure shout that?
  ans:
  - Of course I'm sure.

- que:
  - What are you thinking?
  ans:
  - Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.

- que:
  - What dam?
  ans:
  - The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.

- que:
  - Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. That bother you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Know him?
  ans:
  - No, I think I'd remember.

- que:
  - And Hollis knew about it?
  ans:
  - It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.

- que:
  - What? What is it?
  ans:
  - There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.

- que:
  - Is that unusual?
  ans:
  - Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.

- que:
  - What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
  ans:
  - Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.

- que:
  - What were you doing there?
  ans:
  - Working for the District Attorney.

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - As little as possible.

- que:
  - The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
  ans:
  - They do in Chinatown.

- que:
  - Hold still. Why?
  ans:
  - You can't always tell what's going on there.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Your eye.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - There's something black in the green part of your eye.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Just... I have to.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - The Albacore Club.

- que:
  - He owns it. You know?
  ans:
  - I saw him.

- que:
  - You saw my fa... father? When?
  ans:
  - This morning.

- que:
  - What did he say? What did he say?
  ans:
  - That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.

- que:
  - Do? To who?
  ans:
  - Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.

- que:
  - That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
  ans:
  - It's possible.

- que:
  - Including the death of your husband?
  ans:
  - It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.

- que:
  - She's too upset.
  ans:
  - The police?

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.

- que:
  - You mean she just found out?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What does it look like?
  ans:
  - Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.

- que:
  - You won't go to the police if I tell you?
  ans:
  - I will if you don't.

- que:
  - Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
  ans:
  - I took your husband's Buick... I'll return it tomorrow.

- que:
  - Aren't you coming back with me?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.

- que:
  - Did you get some sleep?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Upstairs. Why?
  ans:
  - I want to see her.

- que:
  - You're going to miss your train! Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
  ans:
  - ...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?

- que:
  - You know any good criminal lawyers?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...

- que:
  - That's good. Now what's her name?
  ans:
  - Katherine.

- que:
  - Katherine?... Katherine who?
  ans:
  - She's my daughter.

- que:
  - Yeah... where are you taking her now?
  ans:
  - Back to Mexico.

- que:
  - How about a plane?
  ans:
  - That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.

- que:
  - ...where does Kyo live?
  ans:
  - With us.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - He didn't wear bifocals.

- que:
  - Walsh here?
  ans:
  - He's in the dark room.

- que:
  - Where'd he go yesterday?
  ans:
  - Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.

- que:
  - Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
  ans:
  - Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

- que:
  - Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.

- que:
  - Shut the fuck up! ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
  ans:
  - I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.

- que:
  - ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
  ans:
  - No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...

- que:
  - The obituary column?
  ans:
  - You'll find one of those people.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Ida Sessions.

- que:
  - Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. We don't.

- que:
  - Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
  ans:
  - We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.

- que:
  - I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. Be happy to show you.

- que:
  - Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
  ans:
  - Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.

- que:
  - And Mulwray isn't?
  ans:
  - He never even kids about it.

- que:
  - Help yourself.
  ans:
  - You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?

- que:
  - Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you. Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
  ans:
  - Hope so. He's working for us.

- que:
  - Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
  ans:
  - I cut myself shaving.

- que:
  - Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
  ans:
  - I never was.

- que:
  - Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
  ans:
  - I said, the northwest valley.

- que:
  - You're a married man, am I right?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Do you know me?
  ans:
  - Well... I think I... I would've remembered.

- que:
  - Have we ever met?
  ans:
  - Well, no.

- que:
  - Never?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
  ans:
  - Si.

- que:
  - What about the water?
  ans:
  - When it comes.

- que:
  - When it comes? What'd you tell him?
  ans:
  - Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.

- que:
  - Jake, what're you doin' here?
  ans:
  - Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.

- que:
  - So how are you, Morty?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Come again?
  ans:
  - Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.

- que:
  - Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - It's bone dry, Morty.

- que:
  - PHONE Gittes?... Gittes?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah?... I do?
  ans:
  - PHONE Sure you do.

- que:
  - How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
  ans:
  - Mr. Gittes...

- que:
  - No, really?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so.

- que:
  - Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.

- que:
  - Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
  ans:
  - ...Yes of course.

- que:
  - All right, what's your husband's first name?
  ans:
  - Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

- que:
  - Water and Power?
  ans:
  - This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.

- que:
  - Yeah. Do you have any references?
  ans:
  - City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.

- que:
  - Never heard of 'em... new owners?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - He's not in, Mr.?
  ans:
  - Gittes.

- que:
  - It's personal. Has he been out long?
  ans:
  - Since lunch.

- que:
  - Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
  ans:
  - Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.

- que:
  - Julian Cross worked for the water department?
  ans:
  - Yes. No.

- que:
  - He did or he didn't?
  ans:
  - He owned it.

- que:
  - He owned the water department?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - He owned the entire water supply for the city?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did they get it away from him?
  ans:
  - Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.

- que:
  - This?
  ans:
  - They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.

- que:
  - Apple core?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
  ans:
  - Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.

- que:
  - So he says you sent them?
  ans:
  - They're all a bunch of phonies.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.

- que:
  - What's that, pal?
  ans:
  - Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.

- que:
  - Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
  ans:
  - Mortgage Department, First National Bank.

- que:
  - Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
  ans:
  - We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.

- que:
  - I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
  ans:
  - Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.

- que:
  - She ran away?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.

- que:
  - Well, you never know, do you?
  ans:
  - That's for sure.

- que:
  - Why'd she run away?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.

- que:
  - We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
  ans:
  - She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.

- que:
  - You don't say?
  ans:
  - Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.

- que:
  - Alfredo, did you know my father?
  ans:
  - Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.

- que:
  - Will they really find work in Germany?
  ans:
  - Come in, Alfredo.

- que:
  - How's school?
  ans:
  - OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...

- que:
  - Why? What do you mean?
  ans:
  - That's right, Modern Times.

- que:
  - Now what can you see?
  ans:
  - Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.

- que:
  - Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
  ans:
  - Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...

- que:
  - You weren't expecting me?
  ans:
  - No, nobody came.

- que:
  - Did you ever see her again?
  ans:
  - No. And nobody knows where she is.

- que:
  - Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
  ans:
  - Thanks for all you've done for me.

- que:
  - Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
  ans:
  - What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!

- que:
  - You understand now? You see it clearly?
  ans:
  - Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!

- que:
  - So what'd they say?
  ans:
  - No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - You're still beautiful...

- que:
  - Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
  ans:
  - Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.

- que:
  - No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
  ans:
  - All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...

- que:
  - Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
  ans:
  - It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.

- que:
  - I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
  ans:
  - It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.

- que:
  - I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Then where's the money?
  ans:
  - OK...

- que:
  - How long's it been shut?
  ans:
  - That's fine, Mr. Kane.

- que:
  - Hey, Brad! Brad! He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never. We would have heard.
  ans:
  - Where is he?

- que:
  - What does it say there?
  ans:
  - Thais.

- que:
  - Ready for dinner, Brad?
  ans:
  - It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.

- que:
  - You don't really think so?
  ans:
  - Please, Mr. Bernstein.

- que:
  - Well, the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
  ans:
  - That's a long story.

- que:
  - And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

- que:
  - Enthusiastic?
  ans:
  - Yes, very! Naturally.

- que:
  - I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
  ans:
  - Well, well - isn't that nice?

- que:
  - I'm going back there.
  ans:
  - Who else you been to see?

- que:
  - Who said anything about brooms?
  ans:
  - We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.

- que:
  - Do you, Mr. Leland?
  ans:
  - Certainly not.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.

- que:
  - Do we stand for the same things that the \"Chronicle\" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
  ans:
  - Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

- que:
  - Do you, Mr. Leland?
  ans:
  - Certainly not.

- que:
  - Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?
  ans:
  - Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic. I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.

- que:
  - What's happened?
  ans:
  - If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.

- que:
  - Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

- que:
  - Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
  ans:
  - I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.

- que:
  - Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
  ans:
  - How do you do, Mr. Leland?

- que:
  - That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
  ans:
  - How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

- que:
  - Was the show covered by every department?
  ans:
  - Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.

- que:
  - And the notice?
  ans:
  - Yes - Mr. Kane.

- que:
  - Is it good?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. kane.

- que:
  - It isn't finished?
  ans:
  - No, Mr. Kane.

- que:
  - That's Leland, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. Kane.

- que:
  - Has he said when he'll finish?
  ans:
  - We haven't heard from him.

- que:
  - He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
  ans:
  - The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad - I shall be here in the morning.

- que:
  - There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
  ans:
  - The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

- que:
  - I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
  ans:
  - You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. They live here, too?
  ans:
  - No. They've passed on.

- que:
  - Where's the soap?
  ans:
  - In the water.

- que:
  - Where's the towel?
  ans:
  - On the chiffonier. Here.

- que:
  - A chicken?
  ans:
  - No. But you're close.

- que:
  - A rooster?
  ans:
  - I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.

- que:
  - How old did you say you were?
  ans:
  - I didn't say.

- que:
  - I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
  ans:
  - Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.

- que:
  - That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I work at Seligman's.

- que:
  - Is that what you want to do?
  ans:
  - I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.

- que:
  - What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
  ans:
  - Yes -

- que:
  - Would you sing for me?
  ans:
  - Half past eleven.

- que:
  - At night?
  ans:
  - Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.

- que:
  - Can't we go back, Charlie?
  ans:
  - It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.

- que:
  - Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
  ans:
  - I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.

- que:
  - I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
  ans:
  - Can you prove it isn't?

- que:
  - Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
  ans:
  - Can't say, sir.

- que:
  - Do you know what that is?
  ans:
  - It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.

- que:
  - He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
  ans:
  - It's been a tough day.

- que:
  - It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.
  ans:
  - What're you going to do, Charlie?

- que:
  - Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
  ans:
  - Say, Brad. I've got an idea.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I mean I've got a job for you.

- que:
  - You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
  ans:
  - I'd like that.

- que:
  - Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
  ans:
  - Why not? Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.

- que:
  - What do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.

- que:
  - Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the \"Enquirer\" in his pocket?
  ans:
  - and that copy of the \"Enquirer\" said the President should be killed.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Brad?
  ans:
  - Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.

- que:
  - Why, Brad?
  ans:
  - She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.

- que:
  - There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
  ans:
  - Do you think the \"Enquirer\" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?

- que:
  - Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
  ans:
  - Are you finished?

- que:
  - You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
  ans:
  - Mr. Leland sent back that check.

- que:
  - What check?
  ans:
  - You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.

- que:
  - That's what you think, is it, Jim?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
  ans:
  - Sure, Mr. Leland. I'll be glad to.

- que:
  - Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
  ans:
  - Right here, Mrs. Kane.

- que:
  - How do you do, Charles?
  ans:
  - Yeah, all in crates.

- que:
  - I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
  ans:
  - Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.

- que:
  - Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
  ans:
  - Yes, and maybe he didn't.

- que:
  - That's the whole works, right up to date.
  ans:
  - Queer?

- que:
  - Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Millions - if anybody wants it.

- que:
  - The banks are out of luck, eh?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. They'll clear all right.

- que:
  - How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
  ans:
  - I'd rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.

- que:
  - How did you meet him?
  ans:
  - I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it.

- que:
  - What about that apartment?
  ans:
  - In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -

- que:
  - Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
  ans:
  - She'll snap out of it. Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. Sooner.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Unnhh!

- que:
  - This? How long have you been smoking?
  ans:
  - Thanks. Have a good one.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I drink this here?
  ans:
  - Sure. Go ahead.

- que:
  - How long have you been a smoker?
  ans:
  - Excuse me, but...

- que:
  - This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
  ans:
  - Fifty-five.

- que:
  - Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
  ans:
  - She said not to come home until graduation.

- que:
  - Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
  ans:
  - What can I say? He does weird things to me.

- que:
  - Can I watch?
  ans:
  - You can hold me down.

- que:
  - Can I join in?
  ans:
  - You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.

- que:
  - Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
  ans:
  - A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.

- que:
  - Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
  ans:
  - Dick.

- que:
  - So where is he?
  ans:
  - He went home to change for the big date.

- que:
  - God, isn't he great?
  ans:
  - No, this is great.

- que:
  - Can I use the bathroom?
  ans:
  - There's no light back there.

- que:
  - Why aren't there any lights?
  ans:
  - Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.

- que:
  - Am I missing something here?
  ans:
  - I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.

- que:
  - He was?
  ans:
  - You dog! I didn't see you go back there.

- que:
  - When did you get back?
  ans:
  - Just now.

- que:
  - Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
  ans:
  - Train. It took eight hours.

- que:
  - You're just going to lock the store like that?
  ans:
  - I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.

- que:
  - You saw it?
  ans:
  - Very dramatic, I thought.

- que:
  - What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
  ans:
  - I'm not pregnant.

- que:
  - Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
  ans:
  - I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.

- que:
  - Well... kind of, sort of?
  ans:
  - I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.

- que:
  - So you're really getting married?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No, you're not really getting married?
  ans:
  - How like her.

- que:
  - Was I right?
  ans:
  - Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.

- que:
  - And you came here to what? To comfort me?
  ans:
  - The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.

- que:
  - Sang? His name is a past tense?
  ans:
  - Stop it. He's a nice guy.

- que:
  - If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
  ans:
  - I just told you.

- que:
  - Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
  ans:
  - Tell me I don't have something to do with it.

- que:
  - If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
  ans:
  - Jesus, you're caustic.

- que:
  - But can we date?
  ans:
  - I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.

- que:
  - So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.

- que:
  - You mean, on a date?
  ans:
  - Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

- que:
  - How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
  ans:
  - I hear that's a rather popular date.

- que:
  - What about Sing?
  ans:
  - Sang.

- que:
  - So what are you saying?
  ans:
  - You're such an asshole.

- que:
  - What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
  ans:
  - I'm easy, but I'm not that easy. See you later, handsome.

- que:
  - How'd you get here so fast?
  ans:
  - I left like an hour ago.

- que:
  - Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
  ans:
  - Promise me it'll always be like that.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.

- que:
  - Was it you?
  ans:
  - I'm serious.

- que:
  - We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Wait a second? Who was working here today?
  ans:
  - Just me.

- que:
  - Then who operated the store?
  ans:
  - Nobody. It was closed.

- que:
  - With this guy locked in?
  ans:
  - Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.

- que:
  - Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
  ans:
  - She thought it was me.

- que:
  - Are you open?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.

- que:
  - Are you open?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - To the back, above the oil. How long are you staying?
  ans:
  - Pack of cigarettes. Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper. She's marrying an Asian design major.

- que:
  - Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
  ans:
  - Lenin's Tomb.

- que:
  - Pack of cigarettes. Cute cat. What's its name?
  ans:
  - Annoying Customer.

- que:
  - So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
  ans:
  - Cute cat. What's his name.

- que:
  - You open?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
  ans:
  - I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.

- que:
  - Why are the shutters closed?
  ans:
  - Someone jammed gum in the locks.

- que:
  - What time do you have to stay till?
  ans:
  - He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.

- que:
  - What smells like shoe polish?
  ans:
  - Go open the sore.

- que:
  - I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. Is the Pelican flying?
  ans:
  - Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I wanted to use your car.

- que:
  - You called Caitlin again?
  ans:
  - She called me.

- que:
  - Did you tell Veronica?
  ans:
  - One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.

- que:
  - What do you two fight about?
  ans:
  - I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.

- que:
  - I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend, let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
  ans:
  - Seven months.

- que:
  - Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
  ans:
  - Five years.

- que:
  - Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
  ans:
  - Eight and a half.

- que:
  - Eight and a half?
  ans:
  - Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.

- que:
  - That's cheating?
  ans:
  - In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.

- que:
  - She called you Brad?
  ans:
  - She called me Brad.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.

- que:
  - Great story, isn't it?
  ans:
  - That girl was vile to you.

- que:
  - Interesting postscript to that story, Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
  ans:
  - Your mother.

- que:
  - You think things would be any different now?
  ans:
  - Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

- que:
  - No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
  ans:
  - ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.

- que:
  - Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
  ans:
  - I think it's safe to say yes.

- que:
  - All four?
  ans:
  - Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - All right, Vader's boss...

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.

- que:
  - So they build another Death Star, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - And you figured it out?
  ans:
  - Basically.

- que:
  - And the second time around...?
  ans:
  - The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.

- que:
  - All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
  ans:
  - You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...

- que:
  - She's in here?
  ans:
  - This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.

- que:
  - What's he looking for?
  ans:
  - He said he has to find a perfect dozen.

- que:
  - The quest isn't going well?
  ans:
  - Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.

- que:
  - Why doesn't he just mix and match?
  ans:
  - I told him that and he yelled at me.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.

- que:
  - What's a jizz-mopper?
  ans:
  - He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.

- que:
  - Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
  ans:
  - I guess not.

- que:
  - Can we talk about this later?
  ans:
  - Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.

- que:
  - How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
  ans:
  - It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.

- que:
  - The milkmaids?
  ans:
  - You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.

- que:
  - Which ones?
  ans:
  - All of them.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.

- que:
  - Smokey Three, thumbs up, am I right?
  ans:
  - The best Burtless movie ever made.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.

- que:
  - The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
  ans:
  - I'm going to miss the game.

- que:
  - Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
  ans:
  - We're not playing in the street.

- que:
  - Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
  ans:
  - Gatorade.

- que:
  - What happened to all the Gatorade?
  ans:
  - I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.

- que:
  - How? When?
  ans:
  - Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

- que:
  - Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
  ans:
  - Number six.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's today.

- que:
  - What!?
  ans:
  - Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.

- que:
  - Shit. What about tomorrow?
  ans:
  - One night only. She's buried in the morning.

- que:
  - You hate people.
  ans:
  - Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?

- que:
  - But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
  ans:
  - Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.

- que:
  - You were saying?
  ans:
  - Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.

- que:
  - She was pretty young, hunhh?
  ans:
  - Twenty-two; same as us.

- que:
  - How'd he die?
  ans:
  - Broke his neck.

- que:
  - That's embarrassing?
  ans:
  - He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.

- que:
  - Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
  ans:
  - Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?

- que:
  - Who found him?
  ans:
  - My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.

- que:
  - His dick was in his mouth?
  ans:
  - Balls resting on his lips.

- que:
  - He made it, hunhh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but at what a price.

- que:
  - Reach what?
  ans:
  - You know.

- que:
  - What, your dick?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.

- que:
  - Fine. Just lend me your car.
  ans:
  - Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?

- que:
  - Why should I loan you my car?
  ans:
  - I want to rent a movie.

- que:
  - Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
  ans:
  - Let me borrow your car.

- que:
  - May I be blunt with you?
  ans:
  - If you must.

- que:
  - The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - What the fuck did you do that for?
  ans:
  - Two reasons, one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're a danger to both the dead and the living.

- que:
  - What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
  ans:
  - Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box, Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.

- que:
  - And this is what you rented?
  ans:
  - I like to expand my horizons.

- que:
  - Holy shit. That girl?
  ans:
  - As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.

- que:
  - Then how come you got the fine?
  ans:
  - Because I'm here.

- que:
  - Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
  ans:
  - Because I'm happy.

- que:
  - You're happy?
  ans:
  - I'm happy.

- que:
  - You're happy to get a fine?
  ans:
  - No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:
  - She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.

- que:
  - I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
  ans:
  - Watch the store while I go home and change.

- que:
  - What happened to title dictates behavior?
  ans:
  - This is my way of spitting water at life.

- que:
  - Hey, what about Veronica?
  ans:
  - You're a snake.

- que:
  - You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
  ans:
  - I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.

- que:
  - Who eats cock?
  ans:
  - Bunch of savages in this town. Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.

- que:
  - Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
  ans:
  - Could be.

- que:
  - She said she did all the work.
  ans:
  - You just fucked a total stranger?

- que:
  - WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
  ans:
  - Around three or something.

- que:
  - What time did we go to the funeral?
  ans:
  - I think four.

- que:
  - What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
  ans:
  - This life.

- que:
  - Why do I have this life?
  ans:
  - Have some chips; you'll feel better.

- que:
  - That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
  ans:
  - I was born.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.

- que:
  - What responsibility?
  ans:
  - All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.

- que:
  - Oh, like your life's any better?
  ans:
  - I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.

- que:
  - Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
  ans:
  - It's the same thing with Veronica.

- que:
  - Am I right or what?
  ans:
  - My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.

- que:
  - The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck?
  ans:
  - It's hard to swallow.

- que:
  - Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
  ans:
  - I thought I was doing you a favor.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Why do I say that? Randal... forget it.

- que:
  - No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
  ans:
  - What don't you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.

- que:
  - What time did you get to work today?
  ans:
  - I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.

- que:
  - You need a ride?
  ans:
  - Got one. Just pulled up.

- que:
  - Same time. What about you?
  ans:
  - I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.

- que:
  - You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
  ans:
  - I'll call you. Let you know.

- que:
  - Are you open?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...

- que:
  - Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
  ans:
  - I'm her sister.

- que:
  - You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
  ans:
  - Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.

- que:
  - You know him?
  ans:
  - Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.

- que:
  - THE GLADES MOTEL?
  ans:
  - I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, what next?
  ans:
  - Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.

- que:
  - How much can you bench?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Did you say Caitlin Bree?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
  ans:
  - No, she's getting married.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.

- que:
  - Wait a second! You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
  ans:
  - All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.

- que:
  - What? When? When did all this shit happen?
  ans:
  - One seventy-nine.

- que:
  - Pay the good man. Don't you close soon?
  ans:
  - A half hour.

- que:
  - We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out. You get high?
  ans:
  - It's not my store.

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.

- que:
  - All right. How much is Pepsi here?
  ans:
  - A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.

- que:
  - Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
  ans:
  - He died in the bathroom.

- que:
  - You used to go out with her?
  ans:
  - We were going to start again, I think.

- que:
  - Don't you already have a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Veronica.

- que:
  - And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - You calling me a liar?
  ans:
  - No; he was probably just resting his eyes.

- que:
  - And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
  ans:
  - No, he got hit by a bus.

- que:
  - Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
  ans:
  - Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.

- que:
  - Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
  ans:
  - The white kind.

- que:
  - I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
  ans:
  - Actually, it is kind of rough.

- que:
  - Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
  ans:
  - I said go ahead.

- que:
  - The porno mags?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.

- que:
  - The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
  ans:
  - All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?

- que:
  - Why did you agree to come in then?
  ans:
  - I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.

- que:
  - Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
  ans:
  - Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

- que:
  - You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
  ans:
  - I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

- que:
  - What were you doing up so late?
  ans:
  - Hunhh? Nothing.

- que:
  - Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
  ans:
  - Who's defensive? Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.

- que:
  - How much money did you leave up there?
  ans:
  - Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.

- que:
  - How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
  ans:
  - Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.

- que:
  - Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
  ans:
  - I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I was kidding.

- que:
  - You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
  ans:
  - Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same, they just have to be there.

- que:
  - Oh, you think so?
  ans:
  - A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.

- que:
  - Something wrong?
  ans:
  - I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just \"being there\"-as you put it-is not enough.

- que:
  - Including you?
  ans:
  - It better be up to and including me.

- que:
  - You've slept with twelve different girls?
  ans:
  - Including you; yes.

- que:
  - What the hell was that for?
  ans:
  - You're a pig.

- que:
  - Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
  ans:
  - Three.

- que:
  - Three?
  ans:
  - Three including you.

- que:
  - You've only had sex with three different people?
  ans:
  - I'm not the pig you are.

- que:
  - No; who were the three, besides me?
  ans:
  - John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.

- que:
  - Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
  ans:
  - It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.

- que:
  - Shit! Why are we getting up?
  ans:
  - Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.

- que:
  - Why do you call him that?
  ans:
  - Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.

- que:
  - He requested this?
  ans:
  - He gets off on it.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Like you said-she snowballed him.

- que:
  - You sucked that guy's dick?
  ans:
  - Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...

- que:
  - Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
  ans:
  - Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - Dante...

- que:
  - HOW MANY?
  ans:
  - Something like thirty-six.

- que:
  - What the hell is that anyway, \"something like thirty-six?\" Does that include me?
  ans:
  - Um. Thirty-seven.

- que:
  - I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
  ans:
  - I'm going to class.

- que:
  - Goodbye, Dante.
  ans:
  - A few?

- que:
  - He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
  ans:
  - Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - At least he wasn't thirty-six.

- que:
  - And that made you feel better?
  ans:
  - And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.

- que:
  - You couldn't get these shutters open?
  ans:
  - I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.

- que:
  - Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Would you let me explain...
  ans:
  - What the fuck did you do that for?

- que:
  - Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
  ans:
  - Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...

- que:
  - Randal...?
  ans:
  - And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.

- que:
  - You open?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm not out of shape.

- que:
  - Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
  ans:
  - Here you go.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - A fine, for five hundred dollars.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I didn't do that!

- que:
  - Scumbag. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.

- que:
  - He's your cousin?
  ans:
  - Check this out, he's from Russia.

- que:
  - He only speaks Russian?
  ans:
  - I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.

- que:
  - Is he staying here?
  ans:
  - He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.

- que:
  - He really wants to play metal?
  ans:
  - English. Come on, \"Berserker!\" Girls think sexy.

- que:
  - Let me ask you a question, Do you think this guy's out of shape?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I can't really tell from here.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...

- que:
  - Sure. How about the beach?
  ans:
  - I like the way you think.

- que:
  - You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
  ans:
  - I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.

- que:
  - Well, how about these two movies?
  ans:
  - I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.

- que:
  - I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
  ans:
  - Well this is the last time I ever rent here...

- que:
  - How long you gonna be here?
  ans:
  - Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.

- que:
  - You're gonna be at John K's party?
  ans:
  - My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh.

- que:
  - Yo, don't sell all that. Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
  ans:
  - The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.

- que:
  - Yo. I'll see you at that party. I'll see you there?
  ans:
  - I'll see you there.

- que:
  - And... he told you all of this?
  ans:
  - Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.

- que:
  - Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
  ans:
  - I'm going to have a word with that asshole.

- que:
  - Which one?
  ans:
  - Dental School.

- que:
  - Says who?
  ans:
  - Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.

- que:
  - Twenty bucks?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just visiting my man. Dante, this is Willam Black. This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

- que:
  - Do you still talk to Sylvan?
  ans:
  - I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.

- que:
  - That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
  ans:
  - No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder. C'mon let's rock an' roll.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That woulda been cool.

- que:
  - C-4?
  ans:
  - More bang for the buck.

- que:
  - I admit, I can be bought.
  ans:
  - Who's shooting?

- que:
  - Jessie, Jessie, copy?
  ans:
  - I copy.

- que:
  - Where's the radio?
  ans:
  - Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.

- que:
  - So, what do you see?
  ans:
  - Surprise me.

- que:
  - A monkey?
  ans:
  - So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.

- que:
  - That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
  ans:
  - It can't fly in this weather.

- que:
  - Bags?
  ans:
  - Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device. Step into my office.

- que:
  - Tucker?
  ans:
  - Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.

- que:
  - I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
  ans:
  - Copy. Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.

- que:
  - Glad you could drop in.
  ans:
  - Love's a killer, isn't it?

- que:
  - Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
  ans:
  - I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury.

- que:
  - You're gone now! I don't climb with people I can't trust. Why'd you come up, to prove something?
  ans:
  - I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.

- que:
  - We'll never know, will we?
  ans:
  - Look, it was a bad time for everybody.

- que:
  - Would you?
  ans:
  - Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.

- que:
  - How's your leg? I'll live. Where'd you leave Jessie?
  ans:
  - Give him the money.

- que:
  - How're ya feeling?
  ans:
  - Fine, I guess...

- que:
  - Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
  ans:
  - Okay--I don't know about this.

- que:
  - Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine. What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance across. Count it as you go, One, two...by eight you'll be there.

- que:
  - Can I count as fast as I like?
  ans:
  - Patience my love, patience.

- que:
  - Gabe? Gabe, where are you?
  ans:
  - Just hangin' out.

- que:
  - On my way. Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
  ans:
  - Hello, Gabriel.

- que:
  - Where've you been?
  ans:
  - Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.

- que:
  - Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
  ans:
  - Did I? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line. Maybe I panicked.

- que:
  - I don't understand?
  ans:
  - You couldn't.

- que:
  - Resuscitation?
  ans:
  - --mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...

- que:
  - Which could maybe what?
  ans:
  - Maybe lead to a flare up...

- que:
  - Listen to you... The old \"mouth-to-mouth\" resuscitation routine, huh?
  ans:
  - From one professional to another, of course.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.

- que:
  - What if he can't?
  ans:
  - I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.

- que:
  - Can't do it? I don't believe this. Don't you feel anything?
  ans:
  - I only came back for you.

- que:
  - What are you doing here!?
  ans:
  - Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.

- que:
  - Where's Hal, what's going on?
  ans:
  - For the same reason you did, to help.

- que:
  - They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we. How are you holding up?
  ans:
  - You know me, I'm a night person.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about me, just go.

- que:
  - I'm glad you find humor in this. Do you know what people would do for that?
  ans:
  - I can't believe you just said that.

- que:
  - Neither can I. What do you think they're doing now?
  ans:
  - Making things real rough for Hal.

- que:
  - Remember the first time we came up here?
  ans:
  - Of course I do.

- que:
  - Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
  ans:
  - Only kidding...actually I attacked you.

- que:
  - If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
  ans:
  - Sure, just give it back when you're done.

- que:
  - We have to get through to the other side. You up for it?
  ans:
  - I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.

- que:
  - Want me to lead?
  ans:
  - Cute.

- que:
  - Nice view, huh?
  ans:
  - Breathtaking.

- que:
  - What was God thinking when he built this place?
  ans:
  - If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.

- que:
  - Gabe! Are you alright?
  ans:
  - No, not really. Throw down a rope.

- que:
  - Can you see light?
  ans:
  - Up ahead.

- que:
  - Gabe are you alright?
  ans:
  - For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright. When I secure the line, come on up.

- que:
  - No luck?
  ans:
  - Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it.

- que:
  - I'm holding you to that. Gabe, what about Frank?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't know.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - Take the rope.

- que:
  - Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
  ans:
  - Good memory. You must be great with numbers.

- que:
  - What the fuck you mean you burned it?
  ans:
  - Never could save a thing.

- que:
  - What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.

- que:
  - What's he doing?
  ans:
  - The best he can since you gave him nothing.

- que:
  - Souvenirs? No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
  ans:
  - No, he's gone.

- que:
  - How far?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - What's your names?
  ans:
  - Tucker and Walker.

- que:
  - He asked you, how far?! I think you've been taking the scenic route. How far from here?
  ans:
  - Copy. Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances to me or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.

- que:
  - Who's going with you?
  ans:
  - You're looking at him.

- que:
  - Where's the rest of the team?
  ans:
  - Bob and Rick are in Denver. I gotta get up there as fast as possible. Frank, get me a load of flares.

- que:
  - On my way. The cases are hooked up and ready.
  ans:
  - Do you always transport through the air?

- que:
  - Why didn't you send the money over?
  ans:
  - Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.

- que:
  - Ask the questions.
  ans:
  - What's the delay?

- que:
  - Man against nature, right Travers.
  ans:
  - You're both with the mountain rescue team?

- que:
  - Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die. How's your health?
  ans:
  - This way.

- que:
  - We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here. Where's the next one?
  ans:
  - Good, Travers. It might catch on, like shooting skeet.

- que:
  - Is it set?
  ans:
  - Primed to go off right over his head, officer.

- que:
  - What's the code, Travers?
  ans:
  - No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.

- que:
  - You're the boss. Let's head out to the tarmac. Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
  ans:
  - Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight.

- que:
  - What did you do that for?
  ans:
  - For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.

- que:
  - Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
  ans:
  - Impossible... I don't believe it.

- que:
  - Been punished, yeah?
  ans:
  - I've been cured.

- que:
  - Of course. Food alright?
  ans:
  - Great, sir. Great.

- que:
  - Won't you join me, sir?
  ans:
  - No, my health doesn't allow it.

- que:
  - ... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
  ans:
  - And you, sir?

- que:
  - And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
  ans:
  - Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?

- que:
  - Phoned some friends, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes. They want to help.

- que:
  - Help me, sir?
  ans:
  - Help you.

- que:
  - No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
  ans:
  - Who are they, sir?

- que:
  - Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
  ans:
  - I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.

- que:
  - Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
  ans:
  - Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.

- que:
  - No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
  ans:
  - You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.

- que:
  - How do you do, sir?
  ans:
  - Hullo.

- que:
  - Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
  ans:
  - Much better, thank you, sir.

- que:
  - Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
  ans:
  - Fine, sir, fine.

- que:
  - Well, shall we get down to it?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.

- que:
  - Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.

- que:
  - A cup of the old chai, sir?
  ans:
  - No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.

- que:
  - So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
  ans:
  - Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.

- que:
  - You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
  ans:
  - That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.

- que:
  - When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
  ans:
  - That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.

- que:
  - Do you feel that way now?
  ans:
  - Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.

- que:
  - Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
  ans:
  - Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.

- que:
  - Who said that?
  ans:
  - I did, sir.

- que:
  - Not feeling too bad now are you?
  ans:
  - No, sir, I feel really great.

- que:
  - Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
  ans:
  - Good evening, my boy.

- que:
  - Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
  ans:
  - As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.

- que:
  - Surprise?
  ans:
  - One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.

- que:
  - Keeping fit then?
  ans:
  - Fine, fine.

- que:
  - Well, how are you then?
  ans:
  - Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.

- que:
  - Well, still the same old place then, eh?
  ans:
  - Oh, aye, aye.

- que:
  - No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute... ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
  ans:
  - Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.

- que:
  - What about Basil? Where's my snake?
  ans:
  - Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.

- que:
  - What do I want?
  ans:
  - Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.

- que:
  - You're gonna be sick are you?
  ans:
  - I wanna be sick.

- que:
  - You wanna be sick?
  ans:
  - Let me get up.

- que:
  - You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
  ans:
  - Alexander de Large, sir.

  ans:

  - Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.

- que:
  - Brown hair, is it?
  ans:
  - Fair hair, sir.

- que:
  - Blue eyes?
  ans:
  - Blue eyes, yes, sir.

  ans:

  ans:
  - Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.

- que:
  - How're you feeling this morning?
  ans:
  - Fine... fine.

- que:
  - What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
  ans:
  - Oh no, nothing of the sort.

- que:
  - What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
  ans:
  - It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.

- que:
  - You mean like going to the pictures?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
  ans:
  - I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.

- que:
  - How are you feeling today?
  ans:
  - Fine. Fine.

- que:
  - Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
  ans:
  - Just part of hospital routine.

- que:
  - No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
  ans:
  - Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.

- que:
  - I just say what the other person would say?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.

- que:
  - Good. What do you want?
  ans:
  - Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.

- que:
  - I hope so. Is that the end then?
  ans:
  - It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.

- que:
  - And when do I get out of here then?
  ans:
  - I'm sure it won't be long now.

- que:
  - What's all this about sin?
  ans:
  - That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.

- que:
  - Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
  ans:
  - You're keen on music?

- que:
  - Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
  ans:
  - Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.

- que:
  - Father, I have tried, have I not?
  ans:
  - You have, my son.

- que:
  - I've done my best, have I not?
  ans:
  - Indeed.

- que:
  - And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
  ans:
  - You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.

- que:
  - I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
  ans:
  - I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.

- que:
  - But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
  ans:
  - I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.

  ans:
  - I used to play this piece back in high school.

  - Let me guess. Clarinet?
  ans:
  - Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.

- que:
  - No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
  ans:
  - There were two of us. I had the other guy killed. Don't need the competition...

- que:
  - You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
  ans:
  - This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans...

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Travel...and things.

- que:
  - You psychic?
  ans:
  - Bottega.

- que:
  - Big case?

  - You never answered my question. You like what you do?
  ans:
  - Most of the time.

- que:
  - But not now?
  ans:
  - Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.

- que:
  - When was the last time you took one?
  ans:
  - Soon. But I take little ones all the time. Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.

- que:
  - How often you go?
  ans:
  - Dozen times a day.

- que:
  - Max, I'm scared. Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot...

- que:
  - This your current address?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You still carrying passengers?
  ans:
  - I was heading back to my garage. It's on the way.

- que:
  - You dizzy? You want to sit down?
  ans:
  - I'm...fine. Fine.

- que:
  - You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?
  ans:
  - Did better'n that.

- que:
  - Get outta here! You and Louis?
  ans:
  - Unbelievable... ...you hearing this? Unbelievable.

- que:
  - Remember what you played?
  ans:
  - The crowd had to dig it.

- que:
  - You know Dmitri?
  ans:
  - Fraid so.

- que:
  - I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied yet?
  ans:
  - One more thing. If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.

- que:
  - It's simple. What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
  ans:
  - I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis.

- que:
  - Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
  ans:
  - Can't say that I do.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.

- que:
  - What? What did you say?
  ans:
  - I said. Get the gun. Out. Of my fucking face. Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.

- que:
  - You tell me. I had to toss the list in the river. I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass. So why don't you show a little courtesy?
  ans:
  - You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.

- que:
  - Tell me. Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
  ans:
  - The fat man on Cherry Street. The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer. The trumpet player. That leaves two.

- que:
  - Can you finish on schedule?
  ans:
  - In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.

- que:
  - Twenty five?
  ans:
  - Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future.

- que:
  - Something going on?
  ans:
  - Pretty quiet down there. A cab just pulled up, aside from that...

- que:
  - Can you fax me his picture? His license or something? What do you mean you don't have that there? Anybody else in the cab?
  ans:
  - ...got off the phone with his dispatcher. What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - No. Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - Take him down. Save Richard Yip, our witness...

- que:
  - ...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
  ans:
  - Ivan Petrov. Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up. I come here, find this.

- que:
  - You guys been holding hands?
  ans:
  - Months now. He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.

- que:
  - What thing?
  ans:
  - Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed.

- que:
  - Oh, right. The guy flipped out or something? Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
  ans:
  - They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - ...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue. The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.

- que:
  - Elvis?
  ans:
  - Joey Cicerno. Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov. Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.

- que:
  - Jesus. Two in one night?
  ans:
  - Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.

- que:
  - What if they're wrong?
  ans:
  - No harm done, ma'am.

- que:
  - Oh, call me Ida. To what do we owe the pleasure?
  ans:
  - I was with Max when he got the call.

- que:
  - And you came all the way down here to see me?
  ans:
  - It's nothing.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Vincent...

- que:
  - I brought you flowers.
  ans:
  - Try?

- que:
  - What am I gonna do with flowers?
  ans:
  - You're gonna cheer up.

- que:
  - By worrying about you spending money on foolish things? So I can watch them wilt?
  ans:
  - He paid for 'em.

- que:
  - You paid for my flowers? They're beautiful. Max, you gonna introduce us?
  ans:
  - Mom, Vincent. Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.

- que:
  - What's he sayin'?
  ans:
  - I'm standing right here.

- que:
  - Yo, whassup?
  ans:
  - Vincent Farrell, Assistant U.S. Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...

- que:
  - How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
  ans:
  - I was just tryin' to...to...

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...

- que:
  - We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
  ans:
  - Nothin'! Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow! Get him on the line, please.

- que:
  - Yeah? So?
  ans:
  - Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Oh. Sorry.

- que:
  - Uh, let's go to... Hello...?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah, sorry...

- que:
  - How long you think this'll take?
  ans:
  - Twenty-four minutes.

- que:
  - Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride?
  ans:
  - An apology.

- que:
  - First time in New York?
  ans:
  - It's home.

- que:
  - You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in. This your regular ride?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.

- que:
  - You prefer nights?
  ans:
  - People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

- que:
  - Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave?
  ans:
  - It's not that kind of job.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job's a fill-in.

- que:
  - Oh? How long you been doing this?
  ans:
  - Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff...

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I don't talk about it, you know... No offense.

- que:
  - Regulations? These guys don't even give you sick leave. How much you pull down on a good night?
  ans:
  - Two, two-fifty.

- que:
  - We have a deal. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Max.

- que:
  - You always stutter?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah. Shit, man. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.

- que:
  - You - you killed him?
  ans:
  - No-no, I-I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.

- que:
  - With what?
  ans:
  - You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX. Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator. So we go to Plan B. Pop the trunk.

- que:
  - The trunk?
  ans:
  - Did I stutter? The trunk. Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...

- que:
  - Got it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It's not me.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What about that?
  ans:
  - I tried it.

- que:
  - How about the thingy next to it?
  ans:
  - The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps.

- que:
  - You better?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It's a mess.

- que:
  - 58th and Central. You know it?
  ans:
  - South Central.

- que:
  - How long, you figure?
  ans:
  - Oh. Oh, no. You're kidding. We...

- que:
  - Are you breathing?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What'd he do to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I only met him the one time.

- que:
  - What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
  ans:
  - Rwanda-Burundi. Central Africa.

- que:
  - You're a cabby. Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
  ans:
  - Please. Don't do anything.

- que:
  - Good luck. You think they got families?
  ans:
  - That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I have a gun and I say so.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Lenny, my dispatcher.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - I need the job.

- que:
  - I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes. Where's the button? Under the dash?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Collateral damage.

- que:
  - I'm...what? Sorry?
  ans:
  - Jazz. Music.

- que:
  - ...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening. Awesome. What do you think?
  ans:
  - I never learned jazz.

- que:
  - That what we're doing? Flowing?
  ans:
  - Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen...

- que:
  - You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
  ans:
  - Jazz? That's funny, coming from you. Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question.

- que:
  - What you mean, no?
  ans:
  - I'm done. Find another cab.

- que:
  - Max? What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Leave me alone.

- que:
  - She's in the hospital.
  ans:
  - Sure? Like you didn't play him? String him along? If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?

- que:
  - What difference does it make?
  ans:
  - Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention. That's bad. And that's not good...

- que:
  - Limos, huh?
  ans:
  - Don't start.

- que:
  - She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
  ans:
  - Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her.

- que:
  - Yeah? What happened?
  ans:
  - He hated everything I did. Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer.

- que:
  - Yeah? Like what? Limos?
  ans:
  - I told you I don't like to talk about it.

- que:
  - Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving?
  ans:
  - See, I've got bills. My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.

- que:
  - What, no insurance?
  ans:
  - Doesn't cover everything.

- que:
  - Good excuse. How many others you got?
  ans:
  - Gimme your wallet.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'll just hold onto it for you. In case they check.

- que:
  - In case who checks?
  ans:
  - Our friends in Little Russia. Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.

- que:
  - Dmitri?
  ans:
  - The man who hired me for this contract.

- que:
  - He's gonna shoot me?
  ans:
  - When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Paid sick leave?
  ans:
  - You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off. Quit stalling and get out of the cab.

- que:
  - Washington and Holt. Dance club called \"Fever.\" Know it?
  ans:
  - Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes.

- que:
  - Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Think she was just being polite?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you?
  ans:
  - No, not just that.

- que:
  - Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - It's what I do for a living.

- que:
  - What's at Union Station?
  ans:
  - How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.

- que:
  - That's the reason?
  ans:
  - That's the \"why.\" That's the why? There is no reason. No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.

- que:
  - Then what are you?
  ans:
  - ...indifferent.

- que:
  - As in...?
  ans:
  - ...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...

- que:
  - Look in the mirror. ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros. How much you got saved?
  ans:
  - Well. That was brilliant.

- que:
  - Max?
  ans:
  - Let her go.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack. Go figure.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The F.B.I., the C.I.A. You name the initials and they're down there.

- que:
  - Any special reason?
  ans:
  - All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - That's love.

- que:
  - Geronimo?
  ans:
  - Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.

- que:
  - But you'll die. You'll squash yourself. What's the point?
  ans:
  - Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings.

- que:
  - Why the hell not?
  ans:
  - I, uh, I have some problems.

- que:
  - What're you thinking, Jerry?
  ans:
  - Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st.

- que:
  - Mississippi?
  ans:
  - Mekong, my friend, Mekong.

- que:
  - Flip. You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here. Tell me something. You think I'm crazy?
  ans:
  - Shut the hell up.

- que:
  - Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
  ans:
  - Testing some top secret seismic weapon.

- que:
  - Do you still ride?
  ans:
  - Not for years.

- que:
  - Well, I -- Jerry, the point. Get there. What does it have to do with the President?
  ans:
  - The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday.

- que:
  - He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough?
  ans:
  - NASA is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.

- que:
  - You going to warn him?
  ans:
  - I can't promise you anything.

- que:
  - Johnny Dancer. You've been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?
  ans:
  - Was waiting till I knew you better. Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.

- que:
  - It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches! You've got to listen to me.
  ans:
  - You bit someone's nose off?

- que:
  - Put down the gun and I'll take your statement. Okay?
  ans:
  - You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that.

- que:
  - What's the charge?
  ans:
  - You were there, Jerry. Figure it out.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Switch 'em. Or I'll be dead by morning. Don't want to be dead.

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - Love.

- que:
  - Sure. You switched the charts, didn't you?
  ans:
  - It's okay. The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store. He had it coming.

- que:
  - You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
  ans:
  - You switched the charts; you tell me.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch. And thanks.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - You saved my life.

- que:
  - Figure of speech. Could we go?
  ans:
  - If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.

- que:
  - Them who?
  ans:
  - Change lanes. Then watch your rearview.

- que:
  - Flat, wraparound headlights?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
  ans:
  - Nothing is easy.

- que:
  - How long have we known each other, Jerry?
  ans:
  - Six months. Eleven days.

- que:
  - You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I think so.

- que:
  - What is it with you and the space program?
  ans:
  - What is it with you and the space program?

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - So why are they after you?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter.

- que:
  - So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be?
  ans:
  - You're certifiable.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Flesh wound. No big deal.

- que:
  - You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
  ans:
  - Surprise me.

- que:
  - Um, coffee. If that's okay?
  ans:
  - If my universe had a hub...

- que:
  - This would be it?
  ans:
  - Equitation.

- que:
  - Are these yours?
  ans:
  - Here it is. Conspiracy Theory It just went out Tuesday. Third issue this year. I bet I struck a nerve. Pissed someone off.

- que:
  - Can you prove any of this?
  ans:
  - You're a Holden Caulfield fan.

- que:
  - Holden Caulfield? Catcher in the?
  ans:
  - Never heard of him.

- que:
  - Was that who I thought it was?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Has this happened to you before?
  ans:
  - Never, but I've been practicing.

- que:
  - Who are you, Jerry?
  ans:
  - Just a guy trying to put out a fire.

- que:
  - I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean?
  ans:
  - It made me feel like you could see inside of me. And I don't know how that's possible.

- que:
  - How is it possible?
  ans:
  - I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.

- que:
  - Is this your dad?
  ans:
  - That was him.

- que:
  - Is he dead?
  ans:
  - Please put it down.

- que:
  - How'd he die?
  ans:
  - He was murdered.

- que:
  - You watch me, don't you?
  ans:
  - Johnny Dancer, right? You don't ride him anymore, do you? Not since your dad died.

- que:
  - What van?
  ans:
  - Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.

- que:
  - Where'd you get your subscribers?
  ans:
  - I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced.

- que:
  - You haven't been bothering them, have you?
  ans:
  - They're dead. Four out of five anyhow. All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.

- que:
  - Realized what?
  ans:
  - Henry Finch. That they monitor everything. That it was only a matter of time. And now four people are dead.

- que:
  - Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
  ans:
  - Cold War's over, Jerry.

- que:
  - Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
  ans:
  - Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.

- que:
  - Murdered?
  ans:
  - Right here in Manhattan.

- que:
  - Where then?
  ans:
  - Right here. In the 7th Street subway station.

- que:
  - You will?
  ans:
  - If that's what you want. Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Those are song lyrics, Jerry.

- que:
  - Yeah... Would you, I mean, could you love me then? If I was normal. Maybe?
  ans:
  - Don't do this to yourself. Jerry. You don't love me.

- que:
  - I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - You look great.

- que:
  - No. That wouldn't be fair. Where are we going, Jerry?
  ans:
  - It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you. But first things first.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.

- que:
  - We're going to Queens?
  ans:
  - Not today.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - This way.

- que:
  - Where are we going, Jerry?
  ans:
  - Connecticut.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three. John Wilkes Oswald.

- que:
  - Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
  ans:
  - He gave it to me.

- que:
  - Where were you the day he died?
  ans:
  - At a horse show.

- que:
  - Did you kill my father?!
  ans:
  - That's the last time you rode, isn't it? Do you think it was your fault? Is that why?

- que:
  - Jerry. Please. You don't understand. I have to know. It's all I think about. Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I know what it's like.

- que:
  - Back where?
  ans:
  - Someone else might call it stalking. My dad felt it. He started carrying a gun.

- que:
  - Why not, Jerry?
  ans:
  - Because he believed me.

- que:
  - How'd you get the picture?
  ans:
  - Your father, he was dying. He was worried about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his baby.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - You got to get out of here. My cell phone's on. Back in the truck.

- que:
  - How did you know?
  ans:
  - I spent two years here. This used to bring the med-cart. Demerol. Phenobarb. It's Jacob's Ladder.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me. Now.

- que:
  - Don't die on me, Jerry. Okay?
  ans:
  - I can't promise you anything.

- que:
  - You think it's a conspiracy?
  ans:
  - Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - Yes you do, Jerry. Quite well.

- que:
  - Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own. Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
  ans:
  - We've arranged for you to take the blame. Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.

- que:
  - You're welcome. Where's my partner?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure what you mean.

- que:
  - You made your decision yet?
  ans:
  - I'm leaning toward no.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - A dog bit it.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - You were going to ask about my nose. The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.

- que:
  - And you have no idea where he lives?
  ans:
  - You've asked me that one three times.

- que:
  - Why you?
  ans:
  - Honestly? I think he has a crush on me.

- que:
  - Veritas. Truth. What is it they say about truth?
  ans:
  - The truth shall make you free.

- que:
  - Fine. What the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - Please, sit.

- que:
  - It was mind control. Manchurian kind of stuff, right?
  ans:
  - A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal.

- que:
  - As in Catcher in the Rye?
  ans:
  - I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.

- que:
  - Terminal?
  ans:
  - As in 'resulting in death.' We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.

- que:
  - And what did I say?
  ans:
  - A dog.

- que:
  - These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's right.

- que:
  - If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live. Why are you telling me all this?
  ans:
  - So you'll believe what I tell you next. Because I need to find Jerry. And I don't think I can do that without you.

- que:
  - So, you doing anything tonight?
  ans:
  - Working.

- que:
  - Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - Working.

- que:
  - Night after that?
  ans:
  - Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.

- que:
  - What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
  ans:
  - Federal Bureau of Investigation.

- que:
  - Do you have an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Agent Lowry?
  ans:
  - Ah, your psychotic is here.

- que:
  - Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate. Why is that?
  ans:
  - We don't know who Jonas is. We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.

- que:
  - What the hell does that mean?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Didn't see him.

- que:
  - It's his show for now. Look, you want to get some dinner? Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
  ans:
  - When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.

- que:
  - Can I talk to you a second?
  ans:
  - Go ahead. We'll be right down.

- que:
  - Do you believe me?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I do.

- que:
  - Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
  ans:
  - You think we have time to fool around like this? Come on.

- que:
  - Nothing. I was just making sure. So, who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.

- que:
  - And Jonas?
  ans:
  - He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.

- que:
  - He's shown himself. Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
  ans:
  - Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.

- que:
  - No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me.

- que:
  - What do you suggest?
  ans:
  - That you come with me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.

- que:
  - Anything happening in there, El?
  ans:
  - We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation. Control to Arroway, you okay in there? Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.

- que:
  - Ellie?
  ans:
  - We've lost contact.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.

- que:
  - ... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you? As your father?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Is it possible...?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

- que:
  - Still settling in, really. Where's Dr. Arroway?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Okay. Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - No, thanks.

- que:
  - Oh? How's he doing?
  ans:
  - Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.

- que:
  - President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
  ans:
  - Now exactly. It's... complicated.

- que:
  - ... could it be a nested code of some sort?
  ans:
  - You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...

- que:
  - What? Why?
  ans:
  - With me.

- que:
  - What is it? What's happened?
  ans:
  - We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.

- que:
  - Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
  ans:
  - Do you have a minute -- ?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.

- que:
  - You aren't staying?
  ans:
  - This... seemed best.

- que:
  - What would you have me say, David?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.

- que:
  - Thank you?
  ans:
  - For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.

- que:
  - What does it say?
  ans:
  - It could be anything. The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...

- que:
  - How soon will you be able to decode it?
  ans:
  - ... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.

- que:
  - Dr. Lunacharsky...?
  ans:
  - Analyzing signal polarization shifts.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We've repeated. A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - No primer.

- que:
  - How can that be?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.

- que:
  - J39 Z186...?
  ans:
  - Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.

- que:
  - I'm not sure. You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
  ans:
  - Hydrogen times pi... Got it. Strong sucker.

- que:
  - How's the spying tonight, guys?
  ans:
  - NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.

- que:
  - Dr. Cullers?
  ans:
  - Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.

- que:
  - Ellie. Pulsar?
  ans:
  - 1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.

- que:
  - Nice. Where?
  ans:
  - Here, right around Centaurus A.

- que:
  - This is how you see the sky?
  ans:
  - It's how I hear it. The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.

- que:
  - Can't we get rid of them?
  ans:
  - It's a civilian facility.

- que:
  - That's terrific, but there's one problem, we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
  ans:
  - You want to classify prime numbers?

- que:
  - Is that your official response?
  ans:
  - I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.

- que:
  - But what do I say?
  ans:
  - Just be yourself, Captain. Find out where he is.

- que:
  - Could we hear to China?
  ans:
  - On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night. Come on now, under the covers.

- que:
  - Could we hear to the moon?
  ans:
  - Big enough radio, I don't see why not.

- que:
  - Could we hear God?
  ans:
  - Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.

- que:
  - Time to sleep now, Captain. But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
  ans:
  - You're not real. None of this is.

- que:
  - So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
  ans:
  - Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that about anything.

- que:
  - So who -- what -- are you?
  ans:
  - Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but...

- que:
  - Can you show me?
  ans:
  - Small moves, Captain, small moves.

- que:
  - Why did you contact us?
  ans:
  - You contacted us. We were simply listening. We've been listening for millions of years.

- que:
  - And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
  ans:
  - Many others.

- que:
  - So who...?
  ans:
  - We don't know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.

- que:
  - The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
  ans:
  - Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams. Some never make it this far.

- que:
  - The librarian... or the library...?
  ans:
  - ... all those voices... you gather them all together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.

- que:
  - So. What happens now?
  ans:
  - Now... you go home.

- que:
  - No! I mean... why so soon?
  ans:
  - None taken... but ... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean.

- que:
  - But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
  ans:
  - No more stalling, Captain.

- que:
  - Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
  ans:
  - The infamous, unfashionable bluntness. You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.

- que:
  - What kind of deal?
  ans:
  - I didn't realize I was out.

- que:
  - You've... found it. What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
  ans:
  - If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.

- que:
  - In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game. Do we have a deal?
  ans:
  - That's my girl. Done.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Japanese squid fleet. They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.

- que:
  - You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium?
  ans:
  - I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.

- que:
  - Why don't you come back with me?
  ans:
  - I'd say this is slightly different.

- que:
  - You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
  ans:
  - ... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing. Still, we've barely started...

- que:
  - How close are you to getting this funding put together?
  ans:
  - It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.

- que:
  - The V.L.A.?
  ans:
  - Thirty-one linked dishes. You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.

- que:
  - Greenbank?
  ans:
  - I'm going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for Drumlin.

- que:
  - It's really happening.
  ans:
  - But what about your research -- ?

- que:
  - That you, Valerian?
  ans:
  - Like it or not.

- que:
  - Ellie -- are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm -- I'm fine.

- que:
  - And where exactly does that put your position...?
  ans:
  - I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet. For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.

- que:
  - And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
  ans:
  - I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.

- que:
  - Can you try?
  ans:
  - I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.

- que:
  - Do you love your parents?
  ans:
  - I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.

- que:
  - Did you love him?
  ans:
  - Yes. Very much.

- que:
  - So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
  ans:
  - Some of my best friends are scientists.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.

- que:
  - What'd you think?
  ans:
  - I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.

- que:
  - Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
  ans:
  - I don't follow.

- que:
  - Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.

- que:
  - It's late. We should go back.
  ans:
  - What are you so afraid of, Ellie?

- que:
  - Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
  ans:
  - An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer?

- que:
  - I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
  ans:
  - So. The final countdown.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure it's come to that.

- que:
  - ... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer, Why would they send me back without proof?
  ans:
  - In other words, God works in mysterious ways...

- que:
  - Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure... Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.

- que:
  - You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
  ans:
  - It's designed purely as a defensive device. Call it a reasonable precaution.

- que:
  - Oh my God...
  ans:
  - How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Well. That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.

- que:
  - Recommendations?
  ans:
  - Have your department make a full report.

- que:
  - We work down in the ditch?
  ans:
  - Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.

- que:
  - How'd you find me?
  ans:
  - Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.

- que:
  - We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
  ans:
  - No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.

- que:
  - What are you doin' here?
  ans:
  - We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.

- que:
  - What went wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.

- que:
  - A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Come on out, Luke.

- que:
  - Then how come it ain't done yet?
  ans:
  - I... I... I...

- que:
  - You got your mind right, Luke?
  ans:
  - Yes, Boss. I got it right.

- que:
  - How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
  ans:
  - Here's the Patrol.

- que:
  - She's got him! You hear that?
  ans:
  - Here, Captain.

- que:
  - Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
  ans:
  - Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.

- que:
  - Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
  ans:
  - Borrowin'.

- que:
  - Whatcha got?
  ans:
  - Pair'a nines.

- que:
  - What happened? How far did you get?
  ans:
  - Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.

- que:
  - A cold drink? Okay?
  ans:
  - That's my baby.

- que:
  - Somebody say somethin'?
  ans:
  - I didn't say nothin', Boss.

- que:
  - Well, whatta we got here?
  ans:
  - A Lucas Jackson.

- que:
  - Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
  ans:
  - Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.

- que:
  - Whatta you so happy about?
  ans:
  - I just always did like truck rides.

- que:
  - You tryin' to say somethin'?
  ans:
  - Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.

- que:
  - Lucille? Where do you get that?
  ans:
  - That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.

- que:
  - Innocent?
  ans:
  - Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.

- que:
  - Where'd the road go?
  ans:
  - That's it. That's the end.

- que:
  - Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
  ans:
  - Fifty's a nice round number.

- que:
  - Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
  ans:
  - Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.

- que:
  - What you mean, Luke?
  ans:
  - I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.

- que:
  - Luke. Where you goin?
  ans:
  - On my own.

- que:
  - Do we even get our same bunks back?
  ans:
  - Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.

- que:
  - You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
  ans:
  - Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.

- que:
  - Like I always do?
  ans:
  - Thass right. Just play it...

- que:
  - Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
  ans:
  - Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.

- que:
  - You ever eat fifty eggs?
  ans:
  - Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.

- que:
  - What's the writing say?
  ans:
  - Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.

- que:
  - Well, how far didya get?
  ans:
  - Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.

- que:
  - That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
  ans:
  - A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?

- que:
  - Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
  ans:
  - Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.

- que:
  - How about you tryin' to make me?
  ans:
  - Oh for...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - None of your fucking business.

- que:
  - What did I do?
  ans:
  - You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia.

- que:
  - Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah? What happened to the newspaper?
  ans:
  - I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

- que:
  - Monsieur Andy can smell your coiffure. And guess what else?
  ans:
  - Cellulite. What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym. Aerobics with housewives...

- que:
  - Andy?
  ans:
  - You parked right behind him. The one I noticed earlier. I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.

- que:
  - What? What'd I do?
  ans:
  - Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Hal has it.

- que:
  - You talked to me. Do you remember?
  ans:
  - We'll get the paramedics...

- que:
  - Tell her about what?
  ans:
  - Yes. Without question.

- que:
  - What pattern was that?
  ans:
  - The same as the first time...

- que:
  - What first two murders. We don't know about them here, do we?
  ans:
  - He told me he had done two others just like it.

- que:
  - When was that?
  ans:
  - When he was seventeen.

- que:
  - I was? How you spell that?
  ans:
  - Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...

- que:
  - What Friday?
  ans:
  - What day is this? In jail you lose track. This week. Friday.

- que:
  - You break into her apartment to deliver a gift? Where is it?
  ans:
  - The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to tell you. It's on the lady's pillow...

- que:
  - Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
  ans:
  - What book?

- que:
  - Something personal. Is he bothering you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'd like to know where he is.

- que:
  - Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
  ans:
  - Damn! I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy! I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.

- que:
  - Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
  ans:
  - In jail.

- que:
  - Who was the man in the basement?
  ans:
  - You like that action? Didn't that cop on TV look solemn? The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.

- que:
  - Where are you, Peter?
  ans:
  - You thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...

- que:
  - It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Inspector Halloran, Homicide. I'm in charge here.

- que:
  - You're calling me a crank?
  ans:
  - Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am? Do you know any of the victims...

- que:
  - If he's not out, why are they here?
  ans:
  - Because of your phone calls.

- que:
  - You don't admire me. No police admire me. I got one of you killed. Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
  ans:
  - You, Doctor Hudson.

- que:
  - Would you want to work with us on this?
  ans:
  - Will you go. Andy, make them go.

- que:
  - Is it an ongoing case?
  ans:
  - For months... last October.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - He felt remorse. He covered her.

- que:
  - Why imitate a dead serial killer?
  ans:
  - Work with me.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left? Click on that... twice.

- que:
  - Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
  ans:
  - It's too big a file to copy to a disk.

- que:
  - Look at the sign. 'Hell'? In the Festival of Love? You make any sense in that?
  ans:
  - It's anybody. It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.

- que:
  - Then what do you need me for?
  ans:
  - Who turned off the Internet computer...

- que:
  - Have you got a warrant? Get the hell out o here! This is the only space I have left in the! Why can't you leave me out of it?
  ans:
  - That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.

- que:
  - Is that it?
  ans:
  - That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.

- que:
  - Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
  ans:
  - He'll get caught. If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...

- que:
  - Why should I trust you?
  ans:
  - Because I'm all you've got.

- que:
  - What's that siren?
  ans:
  - One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...

- que:
  - Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44. It's Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam?
  ans:
  - Look in the crowd. He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...

- que:
  - What does it matter? This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
  ans:
  - The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...

- que:
  - I'm working on it! It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran. I'll wait. Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
  ans:
  - Out. Where does he go? Nowhere. What does he do? Nothing.

- que:
  - How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
  ans:
  - W-We had a fight. I called him... called him a name...

- que:
  - If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
  ans:
  - Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.

- que:
  - I don't want this. What are they?
  ans:
  - You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown. I'll drive you down...

- que:
  - The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
  ans:
  - In the sixties. He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.

- que:
  - It's gone. The file's not here. What did you do?
  ans:
  - I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran. It just did that...

- que:
  - I know 'Halloran.' What's the rest of it?
  ans:
  - MaryJane. We call her M.J.

- que:
  - Are you always so bold?
  ans:
  - No. I'm shy and I'm selective.

- que:
  - The problem for me is... you're in the witness category. Know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Well. Another time, then. I'll be all right. He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.

- que:
  - It's a woman shot in a car?
  ans:
  - Yes. I have to go...

- que:
  - What?...
  ans:
  - She on the passenger side?

- que:
  - Listen to me. Is there a gas station nearby?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is there a phone booth there?
  ans:
  - They all have one...

- que:
  - I know, baby. I know.
  ans:
  - Why don't you shoot off the lock?

- que:
  - You know how to use this?
  ans:
  - They taught me at the FBI. I was very good at it. It scared me... I liked it.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...

- que:
  - We don't see too many lady homicide detectives. You have my respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
  ans:
  - Someone broke into her place last night. It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...

- que:
  - How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - I'm over here? What's your name, Officer?
  ans:
  - Michael Johnson.

- que:
  - Who came in after you?
  ans:
  - Lieutenant Quinn.

- que:
  - What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
  ans:
  - Because it's your job, that's all.

- que:
  - Not what I meant; why me?
  ans:
  - Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...

- que:
  - If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? Where did he pick her up?
  ans:
  - Doped up kids all over town. Park was full of them last night. Very easy pickin'. Goetz's type.

- que:
  - Quinn will be here any minute. What are you going to say?
  ans:
  - You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

- que:
  - I'm sure she thinks it is. Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
  ans:
  - You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone. I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.

- que:
  - He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine. We heard from Doctor Hudson?
  ans:
  - Nada. Lemme make the call.

- que:
  - You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
  ans:
  - Let's get out of here...

- que:
  - Is Niccoletti assigned here?
  ans:
  - Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it... She wasn't killed here.

- que:
  - What about her arms?
  ans:
  - Needle marks, fresh, here. look at this...

- que:
  - What's Abba?
  ans:
  - Bunch of Swedish women. You're too young.

- que:
  - Would you step outside, Sergeant?
  ans:
  - I'm telling I tell you to work.

- que:
  - How about I put Nikko on it?
  ans:
  - That's always your privilege, sir.

- que:
  - Sergeant?
  ans:
  - Yessir.

- que:
  - You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
  ans:
  - Yessir. I have reflected on that, sir. Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.

- que:
  - Who've I got to beat up except the messenger? Does this give us anything to go on?
  ans:
  - I know. Get out here.

- que:
  - So. Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
  ans:
  - Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.

- que:
  - Christ. How old are you? You sure you want to be in this line of work?
  ans:
  - You're damn right I do.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - Helen Hudson...

- que:
  - What the hell you need her for?
  ans:
  - Because I think I'm wrong.

- que:
  - Just, I need results. And -- I am short-handed. Who else am I gonna give him?
  ans:
  - Give him thatpompous son of a bitch.

- que:
  - How'd you get in on the deal?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...

- que:
  - Or the F.B.I.?
  ans:
  - Saks. If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.

- que:
  - Nikko?
  ans:
  - You want mine, too? You take his, you take mine. I'm the one fucked it up...

- que:
  - I just got here myself, Susan.
  ans:
  - \"Spokesperson.\"

- que:
  - ...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern? Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
  ans:
  - I just got here. Talk to you later...

- que:
  - Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler? This is the fourth, is that correct?
  ans:
  - I don't want the job. Don't do that to her. She's worked too damned hard for it.

- que:
  - What's going down with the sting in Chinatown? That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
  ans:
  - Put in the Kevin Costner.

- que:
  - See, now you've annoyed her. You know she doesn't like you to touch me. Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so much! Did you feed her?
  ans:
  - Yes, I fed her. If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you. Again.

- que:
  - She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
  ans:
  - That's what I don't know. Why would you lie? That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.

- que:
  - No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
  ans:
  - We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...

- que:
  - And her husband? What was he?
  ans:
  - He was a chemical engineer with a food company.

- que:
  - Where's the car?
  ans:
  - Outside in the visitors, car park.

- que:
  - What!? They brought the car here?
  ans:
  - My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.

- que:
  - Have you seen it?
  ans:
  - The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.

- que:
  - What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
  ans:
  - No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.

- que:
  - I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
  ans:
  - I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.

- que:
  - Maybe I am a little. James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
  ans:
  - He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...

- que:
  - Do you find him attractive?
  ans:
  - He's very pale. Covered with scars.

- que:
  - Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
  ans:
  - No. But when he's in that car...

- que:
  - Have you seen his penis?
  ans:
  - I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.

- que:
  - You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
  ans:
  - At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.

- que:
  - I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
  ans:
  - I thought that was you, up there.

- que:
  - One of your suitors?
  ans:
  - One of my suitors.

- que:
  - The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
  ans:
  - Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.

- que:
  - So - why the airport?
  ans:
  - I work in the immigration department there.

- que:
  - The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
  ans:
  - That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.

- que:
  - Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
  ans:
  - I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.

- que:
  - And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
  ans:
  - Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

- que:
  - And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
  ans:
  - Yes. They felt like traffic accidents.

- que:
  - Are we allowed to park here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
  ans:
  - I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.

- que:
  - Can you drive?
  ans:
  - I can drive.

- que:
  - Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
  ans:
  - I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...

- que:
  - What does he want from you?
  ans:
  - Hard to say.

- que:
  - I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
  ans:
  - No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.

- que:
  - Crash victim?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you live here? With Seagrave?
  ans:
  - I live in my car. This is my workshop.

- que:
  - What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
  ans:
  - It's something we're all intimately involved in, The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.

- que:
  - Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
  ans:
  - The case could be made.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...

- que:
  - This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
  ans:
  - Yeah, and a dimple.

- que:
  - What kind of place is this?
  ans:
  - I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...

- que:
  - Do we have to talk about this?
  ans:
  - I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.

- que:
  - The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - I miss Beast a lot, too.

- que:
  - Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
  ans:
  - I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.

- que:
  - Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
  ans:
  - So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.

- que:
  - What's up with you?
  ans:
  - Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.

- que:
  - Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.

- que:
  - And the party?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it'll be fun.

- que:
  - Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
  ans:
  - She said she'd be here at 10.

- que:
  - What do you think of this one?
  ans:
  - I'd have to see it on.

- que:
  - But everything's OK?
  ans:
  - Yeah, everything's under control.

- que:
  - What about the engagement party?
  ans:
  - Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.

- que:
  - What about this one?
  ans:
  - You look beautiful.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Truly.

- que:
  - What about the souffle? Has that gone in?
  ans:
  - Fuck me.

- que:
  - What's all the dreck?
  ans:
  - Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Ecru.

- que:
  - Do we have to talk wedding details?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, of course not.

- que:
  - What's his name, Letty?
  ans:
  - I didn't say...

- que:
  - Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
  ans:
  - You don't have to make any decisions tonight.

- que:
  - But what am I going to do?
  ans:
  - Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.

- que:
  - How wonderful, darling. What does that mean for you?
  ans:
  - I'll be running it three days a week, and...

- que:
  - Will you get time off to do that?
  ans:
  - Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.

- que:
  - Are you sure, Dear?
  ans:
  - Come on.

- que:
  - Has Paul heard about his promotion?
  ans:
  - No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.

- que:
  - Can I get you a glass of champagne?
  ans:
  - I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.

- que:
  - Oh, Letty, what happened?
  ans:
  - Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.

- que:
  - I just want to go home. Can we go home now?
  ans:
  - Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.

- que:
  - But what about Beast? Who'll...?
  ans:
  - Ruth's already taken him home.

- que:
  - And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
  ans:
  - Paul said he'd call the school. And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.

- que:
  - Tomorrow?
  ans:
  - As soon as Dr. Emlee says.

- que:
  - Which flowers did you order?
  ans:
  - I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.

- que:
  - Must you walk so quickly?
  ans:
  - It's good exercise, Mom.

- que:
  - Not even if it's something positive?
  ans:
  - Honestly, Letty.

- que:
  - I will, Dear. I promise. Why McDonald's?
  ans:
  - He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom. It's not that easy after you've been locked away.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.

- que:
  - Lie?
  ans:
  - If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
  ans:
  - Letty.

- que:
  - First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
  ans:
  - I answered these questions last night.

- que:
  - Let me shift gears here a minute... Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
  ans:
  - Yes? Go right ahead.

- que:
  - How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
  ans:
  - By color.

- que:
  - What if it's got a pattern?
  ans:
  - Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.

- que:
  - You took bets on my diagnosis?
  ans:
  - It's no big deal. We all compare.

- que:
  - Who do you think you are?
  ans:
  - Don't take it personally.

- que:
  - What are you looking to read?
  ans:
  - Anything interesting.

- que:
  - Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
  ans:
  - Paul.

- que:
  - What have you done with the ring?
  ans:
  - It's magic.

- que:
  - Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
  ans:
  - Don't be ridiculous.

- que:
  - Thanks. Where've you been all day?
  ans:
  - Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.

- que:
  - What's my rap?
  ans:
  - Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.

- que:
  - Shocking, huh?
  ans:
  - Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.

- que:
  - I just want to see Beast. Where would you go?
  ans:
  - The mission up in Santa Barbara.

- que:
  - What else would you do?
  ans:
  - And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.

- que:
  - How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - Oh, right. I'm ready. How do I look?
  ans:
  - Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Home free.

- que:
  - So there were no problems?
  ans:
  - Not a one.

- que:
  - And did you go to the mission?
  ans:
  - Just checking.

- que:
  - I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty deed?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Furnished?
  ans:
  - No, I need some serious household advice.

- que:
  - First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
  ans:
  - I better make a list.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  - I love the pillows.

- que:
  - Do you like it?
  ans:
  - I love your apartment.

- que:
  - What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
  ans:
  - Out? Are you kidding? I've got all the fixings here.

- que:
  - How can you not like the Top 10 List?
  ans:
  - I like it. But Headlines are better.

- que:
  - Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You've got one hell of a great body.

- que:
  - Who ever said sanity was fun?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter. It'll work out.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - Promise. As long as we have steak.

- que:
  - Steak?
  ans:
  - The store was busy.

- que:
  - Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
  ans:
  - You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.

- que:
  - Are you OK?
  ans:
  - Big restaurant interview tomorrow.

- que:
  - The restaurant, too?
  ans:
  - I couldn't even face that one.

- que:
  - How may I help you?
  ans:
  - Congratulations.

- que:
  - Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
  ans:
  - No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.

- que:
  - Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
  ans:
  - You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.

- que:
  - Aunt Lily?
  ans:
  - Bingo.

- que:
  - Bye, Uncle Cort. What's with the lie?
  ans:
  - It wasn't exactly a lie.

- que:
  - What is it? Are you OK?
  ans:
  - Always the drugs.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I saw you talking to my Mom.

- que:
  - Why'd you tell?
  ans:
  - I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.

- que:
  - Silly? Silly am I?
  ans:
  - Michael, take it easy.

- que:
  - Well then why'd it happen?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't fucking know.

- que:
  - What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I know I don't want to lose you. I don't think I could stand it.

- que:
  - Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
  ans:
  - How about something better? Like a kiss.

- que:
  - Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
  ans:
  - I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.

- que:
  - It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
  ans:
  - She's only known the guy a few months.

- que:
  - In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.

- que:
  - Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Oh, ok. Maybe.

- que:
  - But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
  ans:
  - Sure. Of course.

- que:
  - Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Sure. Why?
  ans:
  - I'm going to the store.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - That's a big question.

- que:
  - Of course not, no. Is that why you're here?
  ans:
  - I think we need to talk about some things.

- que:
  - So, what do you say, Let?
  ans:
  - Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.

- que:
  - So will you?
  ans:
  - Of course. Yes. I will. I do.

- que:
  - You can tell me anything. Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - I don't mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter who.

- que:
  - Have you been seeing another teacher?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
  ans:
  - Here's the ring.

- que:
  - How's work going? Are you back at school?
  ans:
  - I start on Monday.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I heard your friend was back in the hospital.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - I need someone to work on budget projections.

- que:
  - Office work?
  ans:
  - Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.

- que:
  - How's it look?
  ans:
  - Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.

- que:
  - So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
  ans:
  - Agent Hadley.

- que:
  - Do you know who this is?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I figured I'd be hearing from you.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.

- que:
  - I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
  ans:
  - A pass.

- que:
  - No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it? Remember?
  ans:
  - You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.

- que:
  - What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
  ans:
  - And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.

- que:
  - Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
  ans:
  - You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.

- que:
  - I thought you wanted Zammito?
  ans:
  - Too many people know about my involvement in this.

- que:
  - Not today. Where are your friends?
  ans:
  - They left about a half hour ago.

- que:
  - Where did they go?
  ans:
  - I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's Elvis...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - It's me...

- que:
  - Marcel?
  ans:
  - Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.

- que:
  - You're there now?
  ans:
  - Oui.

- que:
  - You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're calling me on is phone?
  ans:
  - Oui.

- que:
  - Hey Daniel! Hello? Do you guys speak English?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah.

- que:
  - C'mon, Laurant, America?
  ans:
  - The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's Daniel.

- que:
  - Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
  ans:
  - Good. I'm good.

- que:
  - Can I offer you something. A drink? Coffee?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - -- Super what?
  ans:
  - Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

- que:
  - Okay. How much?
  ans:
  - I'm not here to negotiate.

- que:
  - Why are you here?
  ans:
  - To tell you that we're interested in the property.

- que:
  - Frankie, come in. Good to see you. You want something?
  ans:
  - No, I'm good, Angelo.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - And nothing. He's just feeling us out.

- que:
  - They're gonna be what?
  ans:
  - Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

- que:
  - You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
  ans:
  - Someone else coming?

- que:
  - Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
  ans:
  - He missed three weeks.

- que:
  - Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
  ans:
  - I did. Joey \"Two Tons\" and Nicky \"The Rake\" did the deed.

- que:
  - But you were there?
  ans:
  - Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me about this?
  ans:
  - You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.

- que:
  - They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
  ans:
  - I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.

- que:
  - I assume you want something?
  ans:
  - We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.

- que:
  - And for my help I would get what?
  ans:
  - Half the tapes.

- que:
  - And the other half?
  ans:
  - I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.

- que:
  - Where are you staying?
  ans:
  - I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.

- que:
  - How about if I call you?
  ans:
  - This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.

- que:
  - Tonight?
  ans:
  - I know they won't be home tonight.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.

- que:
  - What kind of business?
  ans:
  - Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.

- que:
  - Why do I always have to answer the phone?
  ans:
  - Because you're the closest.

- que:
  - Why is everything an argument with you?
  ans:
  - I'm just setting my boundaries.

- que:
  - Where are you from?
  ans:
  - Hopefully no one.

- que:
  - No one? Then why is Zero here?
  ans:
  - I just want you there in case there's trouble.

- que:
  - And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
  ans:
  - We'll see.

- que:
  - What about the money?
  ans:
  - Bring me the scissors.

- que:
  - You didn't buy batteries?
  ans:
  - I thought they came with batteries.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I think he's already figured that out.

- que:
  - Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers in a vase\" I would remember it.

- que:
  - Do I?
  ans:
  - This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.

- que:
  - You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
  ans:
  - Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.

- que:
  - What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
  ans:
  - That's Frankie Zammito. The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.

- que:
  - How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went?
  ans:
  - I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.

- que:
  - You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
  ans:
  - No. Chicks dig me.

- que:
  - It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
  ans:
  - I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

- que:
  - What'd you get?
  ans:
  - Some bread and...

- que:
  - Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
  ans:
  - If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.

- que:
  - Does it really matter what I say?
  ans:
  - I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.

- que:
  - Did you have to use that much explosive?
  ans:
  - I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

- que:
  - Guns. Can you get them?
  ans:
  - Man, I can get anything.

- que:
  - I ain't no rat. You got money, right?
  ans:
  - And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.

- que:
  - A thousand dollars?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - We had a deal.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you when it's time.

- que:
  - Okay, we're square now, right?
  ans:
  - There's just one more thing I need you to do.

- que:
  - Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
  ans:
  - Hard to say.

- que:
  - TONS\" French guys? You mean like from France?
  ans:
  - Yeah, French guys from France.

- que:
  - TONS\" What'd they take?
  ans:
  - Everything.

- que:
  - TONS\" Everything?
  ans:
  - Everything.

- que:
  - Great fuckin' song.
  ans:
  - TONS\" Okay boss. Where are they?

- que:
  - TONS\" What'd you guys find?
  ans:
  - Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.

- que:
  - TONS\" And the other car?
  ans:
  - Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

- que:
  - TONS\" Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
  ans:
  - A Wallet. A hotel room card. Some cash.

- que:
  - TONS\" What hotel?
  ans:
  - The Holiday Hotel.

- que:
  - TONS\" What room number?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I didn't look.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - I was told to take what we have and go.

- que:
  - What about transportation?
  ans:
  - You can use my car.

- que:
  - Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is it you do, Sami?
  ans:
  - You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.

- que:
  - What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
  ans:
  - This kind.

- que:
  - This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
  ans:
  - Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.

- que:
  - That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.

- que:
  - What the hell is he talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.

- que:
  - No. How much?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's gotta be millions.

- que:
  - Going somewhere?
  ans:
  - Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - You lived there. You know the city.

- que:
  - Mr. Taylor?
  ans:
  - No, that's not Mr. Taylor.

- que:
  - Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
  ans:
  - \"Vase with twelve Sunflowers.\"

- que:
  - You guys used to work together?
  ans:
  - RAKE\" He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.

- que:
  - RAKE\" Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
  ans:
  - Get in the car.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - RAKE\" They sort of got away.

- que:
  - Anybody know about that car outside?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - You see that car?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - No shit?
  ans:
  - The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.

- que:
  - No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - How are we going to do that?
  ans:
  - I know where she went.

- que:
  - He speaks about himself in the third person?
  ans:
  - Feel free to correct him if you want.

- que:
  - Oh, you think?
  ans:
  - Holy shit.

- que:
  - How do we know what room she's in?
  ans:
  - Wait here.

- que:
  - Where is it, Sophie?
  ans:
  - It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.

- que:
  - The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
  ans:
  - I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.

- que:
  - J&amp;B?
  ans:
  - Glenmorangie.

- que:
  - You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
  ans:
  - Zero did not put it in his bag. He put it in yours.

- que:
  - You wanna tell him?
  ans:
  - It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.

- que:
  - And how do we do that?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - When do we go?
  ans:
  - Tonight.

- que:
  - You ever hear of jet lag?
  ans:
  - Take a nap.

- que:
  - You like shoes?
  ans:
  - No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.

- que:
  - Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
  ans:
  - The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.

- que:
  - So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
  ans:
  - They're not nice people.

- que:
  - Casandra. Old girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - Did she break your heart?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
  ans:
  - You ask a lot of questions.

- que:
  - That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
  ans:
  - I don't remember. I was drunk.

- que:
  - No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
  ans:
  - Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

- que:
  - Who's gonna see it there?
  ans:
  - The lucky ones.

- que:
  - Can't sleep?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.

- que:
  - Who are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - Stick around and find out.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.

- que:
  - Yeah. I'm going home today. What do you want, Frankie?
  ans:
  - I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - A car.

- que:
  - Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
  ans:
  - It's for you.

- que:
  - For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
  ans:
  - Much better. You've been gone so long.

- que:
  - I don't care about your sword.
  ans:
  - Who are you?

- que:
  - This Jade Fox is a woman?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
  ans:
  - I do as I please.

- que:
  - Do you think you are a real master?
  ans:
  - Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind.

- que:
  - Why do you want to teach me?
  ans:
  - I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.

- que:
  - And if I use them to kill you?
  ans:
  - That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

- que:
  - My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green Destiny is mine. Jade Fox can't be your master. Where did you learn that \"Xuan Piu\" move?
  ans:
  - BLACK I'm just playing around.

- que:
  - You're home late... or should I say early?
  ans:
  - Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

- que:
  - That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?
  ans:
  - Long.

- que:
  - Please sit.
  ans:
  - So what if I don't?

- que:
  - I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?
  ans:
  - Put them down.

- que:
  - Do you know her?
  ans:
  - She's one of those. Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

- que:
  - Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
  ans:
  - You're too young to understand.

- que:
  - You're a sword fighter too?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

- que:
  - But you're just like the characters in the stories.
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - I'm bored.

- que:
  - You're doing calligraphy?
  ans:
  - I'll write your name. Just for fun.

- que:
  - No, really?
  ans:
  - Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

- que:
  - Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo.
  ans:
  - You say she killed a policeman?

- que:
  - You know about Lo?
  ans:
  - He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.

- que:
  - Where is he now?
  ans:
  - Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - What I've always wanted, to teach you.

- que:
  - No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb?
  ans:
  - It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

- que:
  - Mu Bai...It's been too long.
  ans:
  - Do you remember the legend of the young man?

- que:
  - Good. And how are you?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon?
  ans:
  - We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.

- que:
  - The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?
  ans:
  - I am. He has always been our greatest protector.

- que:
  - So what will you do now?
  ans:
  - Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.

- que:
  - What have you discovered?
  ans:
  - So I shall avenge my master's death after all.

- que:
  - Did you see who posted it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's. Were you involved?
  ans:
  - It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.

- que:
  - Have you questioned him yet?
  ans:
  - No, not yet...

- que:
  - But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
  ans:
  - No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.

- que:
  - What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?
  ans:
  - I don't know it was stolen until I got here.

- que:
  - Then, why did you come?
  ans:
  - Well, we had talked...

- que:
  - You think Jade Fox will show up?
  ans:
  - She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself. We'll keep our eyes open. Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.

- que:
  - Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?
  ans:
  - Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - I'll look around and catch up later.

- que:
  - Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
  ans:
  - We followed Jade Fox.

- que:
  - That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this?
  ans:
  - Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope...

- que:
  - A murderer?
  ans:
  - Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.

- que:
  - What does it say?
  ans:
  - \"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill.\" Good, the fox is out of her hole.

- que:
  - Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
  ans:
  - Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

- que:
  - What do you have in mind?
  ans:
  - The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.

- que:
  - Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
  ans:
  - He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.

- que:
  - What in the hell... do you call that?
  ans:
  - I call it blood, Detective. If you want, you can call it graffiti.

- que:
  - You buying?
  ans:
  - I'm buying.

- que:
  - No onions?
  ans:
  - They make you fart.

- que:
  - Just don't tell me you \"owe me one.\" What file?
  ans:
  - Double homicide. A year ago. Las Halloween.

- que:
  - Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
  ans:
  - You went out the window. She was beaten and raped. She died in the hospital.

- que:
  - Right. You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
  ans:
  - They couldn't do anything for me.

- que:
  - How 'bout the morgue?
  ans:
  - No. I have one more thing to do.

- que:
  - Mom --?
  ans:
  - I told you you're not supposed to come in here.

- que:
  - I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to -- Oh, Elly, honey, a cat. Here?
  ans:
  - He was a present. Besides, we're moving anyway. You said.

- que:
  - Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
  ans:
  - Out. Now. I gotta work.

- que:
  - I dabble. May I?
  ans:
  - My mom works over there. I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Mister Funboy.

- que:
  - Mister Funboy lives there?
  ans:
  - He has a room, upstairs. I don't like him very much.

- que:
  - Does she have a name?
  ans:
  - No name. You sure ask a lot of questions.

- que:
  - What's going on...?
  ans:
  - A remembrance. A closure.

- que:
  - I remember him! Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
  ans:
  - I think he's yours, now.

- que:
  - You're not gonna come back, are you?
  ans:
  - I don't know if I can. But you have this... and you know where to come.

- que:
  - What's goin' on, Elly?
  ans:
  - I went to see a friend of mine.

- que:
  - Well, how's your friend?
  ans:
  - She's still dead.

- que:
  - You're not a cop, either. What do you want him for?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for a good guitar man.

- que:
  - Do you know what you destroyed?
  ans:
  - Take the dope, too.

- que:
  - Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you.
  ans:
  - It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed?

- que:
  - Cute nickname, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

- que:
  - Another jolly nickname?
  ans:
  - You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.

- que:
  - T-Bird?
  ans:
  - Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there. Ask Top Dollar.

- que:
  - How the hell did you do that?
  ans:
  - Magic.

- que:
  - What the hell are you?
  ans:
  - Interested? Follow the crow.

- que:
  - Miss her?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You work for the dead. Forget that, and you can forget it all.
  ans:
  - Get it?

- que:
  - Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
  ans:
  - Go away.

- que:
  - What... the hell is that?
  ans:
  - This is a cobra, Mr. Grange. Yes, it is real.

- que:
  - Kill a dead guy?
  ans:
  - We've got company.

- que:
  - Is he inside?
  ans:
  - I've got him if you want him.

- que:
  - Who got himself what?
  ans:
  - One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.

- que:
  - I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
  ans:
  - Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.

- que:
  - \"Our\" Crow...?
  ans:
  - The night is young.

- que:
  - Nice speech. What's it supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Your comprehension is not required. Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.

- que:
  - Have we met?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Did you know Sebastian well?
  ans:
  - You might say that.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'll be fine.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - You heard me.

- que:
  - Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
  ans:
  - You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.

- que:
  - No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
  ans:
  - Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.

- que:
  - From who?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

- que:
  - Annette, how long have we known each other?
  ans:
  - Forever.

- que:
  - You promise not to say anything?
  ans:
  - On my mother's life.

- que:
  - So what year are you going into?
  ans:
  - Junior.

- que:
  - Got a boyfriend back home?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.

- que:
  - You a lesbo?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
  ans:
  - I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - I must say I found it rather appalling.

- que:
  - How do you know I've been with several women?
  ans:
  - A friend wrote me.

- que:
  - Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
  ans:
  - It's not really important.

- que:
  - Why are you being so dramatic?
  ans:
  - Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.

- que:
  - What'cha reading?
  ans:
  - The Fountainhead.

- que:
  - You've read The Fountainhead?
  ans:
  - Romantic? He rapes her.

- que:
  - How's the water?
  ans:
  - Refreshing.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because you act like a pig.

- que:
  - Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
  ans:
  - I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.

- que:
  - Need a lift?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - How are you today?
  ans:
  - Give it up.

- que:
  - And that's a bad thing?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.

- que:
  - Don't you believe in love at first sight?
  ans:
  - Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.

- que:
  - Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
  ans:
  - I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - That's none of your business.

- que:
  - How about tonight?
  ans:
  - I'm busy.

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - That's also none of your business.

- que:
  - You truly want to do something to make me happy?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you promise to abide by it?
  ans:
  - Without question.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.

- que:
  - I'm... I'm alright.
  ans:
  - I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

- que:
  - How was your date?
  ans:
  - It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Reading.

- que:
  - What are you reading?
  ans:
  - Of Human Bondage.

- que:
  - Alone again. What are you up to today?
  ans:
  - I'm doing some volunteer work.

- que:
  - Need any company?
  ans:
  - You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

- que:
  - It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
  ans:
  - Oh please.

- que:
  - Lighten up.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - I am lighten. Can we drop this?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Am I bothering you?
  ans:
  - Not at all. Have a seat.

- que:
  - You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
  ans:
  - Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

- que:
  - Why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - Because I'm in love with you.

- que:
  - You really want to know?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.

- que:
  - How am I a hypocrite?
  ans:
  - Please don't go.

- que:
  - Would you like a tour?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Why aren't you understanding?
  ans:
  - I love you.

- que:
  - Why are you trying to hurt me?
  ans:
  - I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.

- que:
  - Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
  ans:
  - My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.

- que:
  - I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
  ans:
  - Ben Schwarz.

- que:
  - Schwarz. Jewish?
  ans:
  - German.

- que:
  - Any ideas who it could be?
  ans:
  - Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.

- que:
  - Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
  ans:
  - Greg McConnell.

- que:
  - The football stud?
  ans:
  - He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.

- que:
  - Are you shitting me?
  ans:
  - Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

- que:
  - Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
  ans:
  - Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.

- que:
  - No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the \"stroke of midnight\" no pun intended?
  ans:
  - I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.

- que:
  - What are the boys like?
  ans:
  - Cecile, is that the best you can do? You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

- que:
  - Where did you find those?
  ans:
  - Margarita found them while cleaning your room.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.

- que:
  - Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
  ans:
  - Eww. No. That's gross.

- que:
  - Do you want to learn or not?
  ans:
  - I guess. It still sounds gross.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.

- que:
  - That's so romantic. Have you responded?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well do you like him?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Did you hide the letters?
  ans:
  - Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.

- que:
  - Of course I would. We're friends, right?
  ans:
  - Best friends.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's Kathryn.

- que:
  - Does your mother know?
  ans:
  - If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.

- que:
  - Why didn't you do something?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Well what then?
  ans:
  - If that's what you call it.

- que:
  - Well did you like it?
  ans:
  - Cecile, you had an orgasm.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.

- que:
  - But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
  ans:
  - Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.

- que:
  - What year are you in?
  ans:
  - I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

- que:
  - You think he'll like it?
  ans:
  - He'll love it.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just taking your photo.

- que:
  - And then I can go home?
  ans:
  - Of course. I'm not a monster.

- que:
  - Just a kiss, right?
  ans:
  - I swear.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - You promised to let me kiss you.

- que:
  - Want to join me?
  ans:
  - Some other time, Cecile.

- que:
  - Am I suppose to be this sore?
  ans:
  - For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

- que:
  - Is it me?
  ans:
  - No, you were fine.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm taking a shower.

- que:
  - Need any company?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Want a blow job?
  ans:
  - Good night Cecile.

- que:
  - Don't you want to change that?
  ans:
  - I think that's all the time we have for today.

- que:
  - Same time next week?
  ans:
  - No. This is going to be our last session.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.

- que:
  - Really? Care to make a wager on that?
  ans:
  - Good luck, Sebastian.

- que:
  - What, nervous I'm going to win?
  ans:
  - Would you please leave.

- que:
  - Honey, is something wrong?
  ans:
  - He told me he loved me and I believed him.

- que:
  - Who told you?
  ans:
  - You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

- que:
  - Greg, is that you under the covers?
  ans:
  - Get out of here.

- que:
  - Did you do everything I asked you to?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you think she bought it?
  ans:
  - I'm pretty sure she did.

- que:
  - Pretty sure or sure sure?
  ans:
  - She bought it.

- que:
  - Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - It's Kathryn.

- que:
  - Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.

- que:
  - And this happened before you and I hooked up?
  ans:
  - It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.

- que:
  - Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
  ans:
  - I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

- que:
  - Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
  ans:
  - Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
  ans:
  - You don't mean?

- que:
  - I see your point... though why should I care?
  ans:
  - I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.

- que:
  - Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
  ans:
  - That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, is she for real?
  ans:
  - Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.

- que:
  - Care to make a wager on that?
  ans:
  - I'll think about it...

- que:
  - What are the terms?
  ans:
  - If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.

- que:
  - And if I win?
  ans:
  - I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.

- que:
  - Even there?
  ans:
  - It would feel so yummy.

- que:
  - Fuck her yet?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Interesting.

- que:
  - I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's your plan of attack?
  ans:
  - I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.

- que:
  - But who will they turn to for help?
  ans:
  - I'm at your service.

- que:
  - Have you succeeded in your task?
  ans:
  - Any day now.

- que:
  - Who are you calling?
  ans:
  - Cecile.

- que:
  - Who are you spying on?
  ans:
  - Take a look for yourself.

- que:
  - That her?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's your problem?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - And that's why you're losing your bet?
  ans:
  - I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
  ans:
  - Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.

- que:
  - Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
  ans:
  - If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.

- que:
  - So what went wrong?
  ans:
  - I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.

- que:
  - Bad time?
  ans:
  - Kind of.

- que:
  - You didn't?
  ans:
  - Oh yes.

- que:
  - Oh come on. For her first time?
  ans:
  - No, tell me.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I'm not in the mood.

- que:
  - And that's why you're leaving?
  ans:
  - It clearly is why.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.

- que:
  - Is that what you think?
  ans:
  - That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.

- que:
  - Why so nervous?
  ans:
  - I've never done this before.

- que:
  - Screening calls. Any suggestions?
  ans:
  - A little melodramatic, don't you think.

- que:
  - Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
  ans:
  - You wanted an answer to your question.

- que:
  - Annette?
  ans:
  - Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.

- que:
  - Ronald?
  ans:
  - Not that it's any of your business but yes.

- que:
  - Thank you. Now, where were we?
  ans:
  - To my triumph, of course.

- que:
  - Come again?
  ans:
  - In any event, you still owe me my reward.

- que:
  - Didn't you hear what I said?
  ans:
  - I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.

- que:
  - And if I don't?
  ans:
  - Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.

- que:
  - How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
  ans:
  - That's beautiful.

- que:
  - Not at all. What's wrong?
  ans:
  - It's Cecile.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...

- que:
  - Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
  ans:
  - It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.

- que:
  - You will be discreet about this?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.

- que:
  - Hi. Is Annette at home?
  ans:
  - You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I need to talk to Annette.

- que:
  - Do you know where she is?
  ans:
  - She's out.

- que:
  - Yes, you already did.
  ans:
  - Do you know when she'll be back?

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - Right after we played backgammon.

- que:
  - We played backgammon?
  ans:
  - Uh huh. You beat me three times.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

- que:
  - I said, do you want some water?
  ans:
  - Oh... no thank you...

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Eight o'clock. You got to go.

- que:
  - Did she show up?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I check upstairs?
  ans:
  - I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.

- que:
  - How will I get to her?
  ans:
  - Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - But you don't keep a cat, do you?
  ans:
  - I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.

- que:
  - That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
  ans:
  - Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.

- que:
  - Does she go up to the Farren's often?
  ans:
  - No. I only let her go with Edward. It's alright.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.

- que:
  - What song, dear?
  ans:
  - The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.

- que:
  - Did you ever make a wish?
  ans:
  - Oh, lots of times.

- que:
  - Did your wishes ever come true?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - But where did you get it, Amy?
  ans:
  - At the old house with the voice.

- que:
  - Do you know the people?
  ans:
  - No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.

- que:
  - Are they nice?
  ans:
  - I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.

- que:
  - It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
  ans:
  - She was very pretty.

- que:
  - What's her name?
  ans:
  - Irena.

- que:
  - Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
  ans:
  - But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.

- que:
  - I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
  ans:
  - I'm sure I don't, Alice. It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly -- She could almost be Irena's child.

- que:
  - Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
  ans:
  - You make me sound like the father in \"East Lynne.\"

- que:
  - Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
  ans:
  - I forgot I had it on.

- que:
  - Where is everybody?
  ans:
  - It's early yet.

- que:
  - All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
  ans:
  - It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?

- que:
  - I think I should. 3000W?
  ans:
  - I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.

- que:
  - My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
  ans:
  - Amy's been lying again.

- que:
  - What is it, Alice?
  ans:
  - I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's your play.

- que:
  - Where did you get it?
  ans:
  - Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.

- que:
  - What's funny?
  ans:
  - Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.

- que:
  - Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
  ans:
  - No, darling, I hadn't intended to.

- que:
  - Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
  ans:
  - You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.

- que:
  - Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
  ans:
  - Yes, daddy.

- que:
  - Did you mail then?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did.

- que:
  - Where did you mail them?
  ans:
  - I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.

- que:
  - Can't you tell me later?
  ans:
  - But I didn't play with them, Daddy. They wouldn't play with me.

- que:
  - What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
  ans:
  - It was on account of the birthday party.

- que:
  - Because you didn't ask them? I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
  ans:
  - They ran away.

- que:
  - It's true.
  ans:
  - Why didn't you run after them?

- que:
  - And who did the voice belong to?
  ans:
  - It was just a voice.

- que:
  - Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
  ans:
  - Because she is my friend.

- que:
  - Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
  ans:
  - Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.

- que:
  - Daddy?
  ans:
  - Yes, darling.

- que:
  - What'd you get for Christmas?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet.

- que:
  - My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - You called me by my name.

- que:
  - Irena. But who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm your friend.

- que:
  - But where is that?
  ans:
  - I can not tell you.

- que:
  - Will you be friend for always?
  ans:
  - No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.

- que:
  - You'll always play with me?
  ans:
  - Whenever you want.

- que:
  - Can't you get it, darling?
  ans:
  - I'll just never learn arithmetic.

- que:
  - A princess?
  ans:
  - Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.

- que:
  - Your children?
  ans:
  - My dolls. We can pretend.

- que:
  - I can sea its breath in the cold.
  ans:
  - You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?

- que:
  - May I pet the deer?
  ans:
  - It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - Yes, Amy.

- que:
  - But why?
  ans:
  - Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.

- que:
  - A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
  ans:
  - Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.

- que:
  - the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
  ans:
  - Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.

- que:
  - Will you come soon?
  ans:
  - Soon as I finish.

- que:
  - That means I can go alone?
  ans:
  - About time for you to come home, Amy.

- que:
  - But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
  ans:
  - There was a deer on the other side of the fence.

- que:
  - But what happened to the little deer?
  ans:
  - Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.

- que:
  - Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
  ans:
  - Because it can't. It's dead.

- que:
  - There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
  ans:
  - It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.

- que:
  - Hide me? Why?
  ans:
  - My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.

- que:
  - Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Anybody could know that song.

- que:
  - Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
  ans:
  - Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.

- que:
  - And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
  ans:
  - It was pale...a shadowed gold.

- que:
  - Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
  ans:
  - What is it, ma'am?

- que:
  - Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
  ans:
  - Yes, everything's all right, Edward.

- que:
  - \"To Daddy from Amy.\" Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, \"To Edward from Amy.\".
  ans:
  - And Amy mailed them?

- que:
  - Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
  ans:
  - I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.

- que:
  - Can we get some service here?
  ans:
  - No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.

- que:
  - Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
  ans:
  - Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.

- que:
  - Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your lips look delicious.

- que:
  - I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
  ans:
  - Never felt better.

- que:
  - A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
  ans:
  - At Victoria's Secret.

- que:
  - I mean where on your body?
  ans:
  - Oh, on my wrist.

- que:
  - A dog at Victoria's Secret?
  ans:
  - No, it was another woman.

- que:
  - How's the rest of your health?
  ans:
  - Good. Except for PMS.

- que:
  - PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
  ans:
  - It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...

- que:
  - What else is there?
  ans:
  - And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.

- que:
  - That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
  ans:
  - Nearly four.

- que:
  - Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
  ans:
  - I get crazy dreams and I black out.

- que:
  - Does she have PMS?
  ans:
  - Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.

- que:
  - Jennifer?
  ans:
  - No it's mom.

- que:
  - You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.

- que:
  - Do you really need these?
  ans:
  - Only to see.

- que:
  - Can't you get contacts?
  ans:
  - No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.

- que:
  - What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
  ans:
  - It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.

- que:
  - Where are all the mediums?
  ans:
  - Frida, grab that red one.

- que:
  - Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
  ans:
  - And she got the medium.

- que:
  - George bit you?
  ans:
  - Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!

- que:
  - Hey, did you get contacts?
  ans:
  - Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.

- que:
  - He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
  ans:
  - There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.

- que:
  - And he was ripped limb from limb?
  ans:
  - I'm sure they were exaggerating.

- que:
  - Why would they exaggerate?
  ans:
  - To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.

- que:
  - No, did you fuck him?
  ans:
  - No. I don't think so.

- que:
  - And then?
  ans:
  - I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.

- que:
  - Are those Mark's?
  ans:
  - No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.

- que:
  - Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
  ans:
  - Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.

- que:
  - Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
  ans:
  - I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.

- que:
  - I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
  ans:
  - Give him the tampon test.

- que:
  - What the hell is the tampon test?
  ans:
  - We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - I think he called you beautiful.

- que:
  - Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
  ans:
  - Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.

- que:
  - So where's this infamous arm now?
  ans:
  - I put it down the garbage disposal.

- que:
  - You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
  ans:
  - It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!

- que:
  - Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
  ans:
  - I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.

- que:
  - Tuesday. Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Shit, I guess I missed work.

- que:
  - Did you get rid of Mark?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.

- que:
  - First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
  ans:
  - He's been here all night?

- que:
  - What? Why'd you do that?
  ans:
  - There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.

- que:
  - How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
  ans:
  - You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.

- que:
  - Why the fuck would you do that?
  ans:
  - I could smell another woman on him.

- que:
  - You expecting someone?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What the fuck are we going to do?
  ans:
  - Hide him.

- que:
  - Does that mean this whole thing is over?
  ans:
  - Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.

- que:
  - So what do I do?
  ans:
  - Fall in love.

- que:
  - But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
  ans:
  - I guess you'll find out.

- que:
  - About Mark? Carlton?
  ans:
  - About Benito.

- que:
  - Did I kill a guy named Benito?
  ans:
  - No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.

- que:
  - Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
  ans:
  - Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.

- que:
  - Frida? You okay?
  ans:
  - Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.

- que:
  - So you're Grant's secretary?
  ans:
  - I do development for TV movies.

- que:
  - You hungry?
  ans:
  - Starving.

- que:
  - Well, whattdaya think?
  ans:
  - That's great. Highly original.

- que:
  - Hey, how about a little nightcap?
  ans:
  - I'm really tired.

- que:
  - Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
  ans:
  - No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I really gotta pee.

- que:
  - Knock what off?
  ans:
  - You don't have to pee.

- que:
  - Since when do you care?
  ans:
  - You look different. I mean you look good.

- que:
  - You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
  ans:
  - Frida, you know you're it for me.

- que:
  - I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
  ans:
  - Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.

- que:
  - You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
  ans:
  - It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.

- que:
  - I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
  ans:
  - Mark.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Wow.

- que:
  - The Nielson's?
  ans:
  - On your desk.

- que:
  - Script coverage?
  ans:
  - On your desk.

- que:
  - Did you change your hair?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.

- que:
  - When's the last time you saw him?
  ans:
  - We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.

- que:
  - Intriguing?
  ans:
  - I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.

- que:
  - You wanna get some coffee?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.

- que:
  - So what book did you buy?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's nothing.

- que:
  - Used to? Did it stop finally?
  ans:
  - No, she died when I was twelve.

- que:
  - Oh my god, by wolves?
  ans:
  - I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.

- que:
  - How about you? Briefs or boxers?
  ans:
  - Briefs.

- que:
  - Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
  ans:
  - He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.

- que:
  - Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Maybe.

- que:
  - What are those?
  ans:
  - Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.

- que:
  - What are they for?
  ans:
  - Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.

- que:
  - Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
  ans:
  - My period? No.

- que:
  - I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
  ans:
  - No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.

- que:
  - Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
  ans:
  - No. I was doing my laundry.

- que:
  - Was there anything in that washer?
  ans:
  - No. Nope, nothing in it.

- que:
  - You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
  ans:
  - NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.

- que:
  - Everything okay?
  ans:
  - A man killed in Central Park.

- que:
  - You had a date with Carlton?
  ans:
  - It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.

- que:
  - But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
  ans:
  - Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.

- que:
  - No, why?
  ans:
  - He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.

- que:
  - I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
  ans:
  - No, I got it. It's okay.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.

- que:
  - Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
  ans:
  - No, but thanks for the warning.

- que:
  - Is that how you feel?
  ans:
  - Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.

- que:
  - What's with the squirt guns?
  ans:
  - They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.

- que:
  - What? Is there someone else?
  ans:
  - Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.

- que:
  - Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
  ans:
  - You at least owe me the truth.

- que:
  - You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
  ans:
  - Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.

- que:
  - Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
  ans:
  - No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.

- que:
  - Worse than this?
  ans:
  - Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.

- que:
  - Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
  ans:
  - I ate a guy last night.

- que:
  - And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't remember doing it.

- que:
  - It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
  ans:
  - Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!

- que:
  - Oh my god, what happened?
  ans:
  - Yes... I... we had dinner.

- que:
  - Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
  ans:
  - No, it was our first date.

- que:
  - A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
  ans:
  - No, I said it was our first date.

- que:
  - Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
  ans:
  - Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.

- que:
  - What makes you think I was the last one?
  ans:
  - No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.

- que:
  - You got a dog?
  ans:
  - No, I have a cat.

- que:
  - How big?
  ans:
  - No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.

- que:
  - I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
  ans:
  - Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.

- que:
  - I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
  ans:
  - It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.

- que:
  - You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
  ans:
  - Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.

- que:
  - Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
  ans:
  - Take some allergy medicine.

- que:
  - How the hell is that your business?
  ans:
  - We're just trying to figure out what happened.

- que:
  - You want her sheets?
  ans:
  - We can just take this pillowcase.

- que:
  - Why would you want to be a cop?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.

- que:
  - Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
  ans:
  - You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.

- que:
  - That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
  ans:
  - Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.

- que:
  - Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
  ans:
  - I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.

- que:
  - Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
  ans:
  - Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

- que:
  - Madonna's in Penthouse?
  ans:
  - Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.

- que:
  - And you think I'm sick?
  ans:
  - He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.

- que:
  - This one walk you home too?
  ans:
  - Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.

- que:
  - You think mafia hit?
  ans:
  - Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...

- que:
  - What makes her think that?
  ans:
  - She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.

- que:
  - Did we get those DNA tests back?
  ans:
  - Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.

- que:
  - What kind of animal?
  ans:
  - I need something to keep me awake.

- que:
  - What of?
  ans:
  - The city. I need to get to the ocean.

- que:
  - Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that?
  ans:
  - Maybe ten minutes... Thats strange.

- que:
  - What's he doing here?
  ans:
  - Says he is the man's doctor... You know...

- que:
  - The other one?
  ans:
  - His wife.

- que:
  - Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
  ans:
  - No one available.

- que:
  - How will we interrogate them?
  ans:
  - Well, sir... I don't know exactly.

- que:
  - Doctor! What brings you here?
  ans:
  - Just visiting my patient.

- que:
  - Really? And how is his state of mind?
  ans:
  - He's seriously disturbed...

- que:
  - You seem a little edgy. Everything okay?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course. Everything's fine...

- que:
  - Loose ends?
  ans:
  - I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin...

- que:
  - What is this place?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself.

- que:
  - Was that for real down there?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so.

- que:
  - Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
  ans:
  - Germs, sir. These places are full of them.

- que:
  - What about Thompson, sir? Wasnt this his case?
  ans:
  - Shes getting better, thanks. She...

- que:
  - Why do you want to speak to him?
  ans:
  - A hunch. He might be able to...

- que:
  - Ill be the judge of that. Anything else?
  ans:
  - Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...

- que:
  - Lost something?
  ans:
  - Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help.

- que:
  - How could you have been so stupid?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
  ans:
  - Patricia Crenshaw.

- que:
  - How can I submit this?
  ans:
  - Im sorry...

- que:
  - Do you wash your hands before you type things?
  ans:
  - Why, yes.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Won't say. Says he must talk to you.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. Everything?
  ans:
  - All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Shut-up.

- que:
  - Why give yourself up?
  ans:
  - I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.

- que:
  - That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
  ans:
  - I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - I don't know who they are.

- que:
  - Why are they after you?
  ans:
  - Don't know that either.

- que:
  - Don't know much, do you?
  ans:
  - They didn't have faces.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go on.

- que:
  - Where do you think this goes?
  ans:
  - It sure isn't the fun-fair.

- que:
  - This ocean business... I know where I can find a map. I need to go back to the station. Where will you be?
  ans:
  - Can't let you in... sorry.

- que:
  - What? Who has?
  ans:
  - Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.

- que:
  - What is going on?
  ans:
  - Jesus! We have to get you to a doctor...

- que:
  - But... How long has this been happening?
  ans:
  - Such a joker! Like your father.

- que:
  - You see it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where does it lead?
  ans:
  - It must be a closet or something.

- que:
  - A book of delusions. Anything else?
  ans:
  - But I...

- que:
  - I see. Then who is after you? What sins have you committed?
  ans:
  - Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.

- que:
  - You know something about me?
  ans:
  - Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try.

- que:
  - Waves... A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
  ans:
  - What does she say? The woman.

- que:
  - Bad dreams?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
  ans:
  - That's right. I am your doctor.

- que:
  - Known me for long?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - Did she drown? The woman you told me about?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.

- que:
  - Can I get my life back?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I have to go...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it.

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - I'm... being... punished.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - We are... living in their dreams...

- que:
  - How do you know I'm innocent?
  ans:
  - Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...

- que:
  - I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
  ans:
  - They're dead, John.

- que:
  - Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
  ans:
  - Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...

- que:
  - Is this dangerous or anything?
  ans:
  - No more than the usual.

- que:
  - Uh -- I don't know. Sometimes it's just like a barter thing... Is this legal?
  ans:
  - First Lady...

- que:
  - You're kidding?
  ans:
  - It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.

- que:
  - What's with her?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech?
  ans:
  - Dave...

- que:
  - What the hell is this ?
  ans:
  - The Washington Post.

- que:
  - Well, maybe I am. But you're fired.
  ans:
  - Choices?

- que:
  - ... what?
  ans:
  - I said you're fired. Go on -- get outta here.

- que:
  - Oh... I'm fired?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Fine?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Where's the girl?
  ans:
  - TilT we figure something out.

- que:
  - Like how?
  ans:
  - Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...

- que:
  - Mild stroke?
  ans:
  - Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.

- que:
  - Up and around? Soon?
  ans:
  - Soon.

- que:
  - Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
  ans:
  - You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.

- que:
  - What about containment, Alan?
  ans:
  - I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.

- que:
  - Is that everybody?
  ans:
  - Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.

- que:
  - What do you mean, he's clean?
  ans:
  - I mean I've checked everything. Women. Liquor... Finances. I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.

- que:
  - What about the wife?
  ans:
  - Clean.

- que:
  - Are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - Uh, let me get back to you...

- que:
  - You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
  ans:
  - Alan, we still have to control this guy...

- que:
  - How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
  ans:
  - Three years.

- que:
  - What's with the cameras?
  ans:
  - Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.

- que:
  - Do we have anything on the budget today?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to kill him.

- que:
  - Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
  ans:
  - He was only doing his job.

- que:
  - What do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - Just what you think I mean.

- que:
  - Are you threatening me?
  ans:
  - Sort of... Yeah.

- que:
  - So you want to go swimming?
  ans:
  - Dave -- I'm working.

- que:
  - Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later?
  ans:
  - I was gonna do something with Joan.

- que:
  - I am the government.
  ans:
  - And who's gonna find out?

- que:
  - I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - I'm not surprised. Can we save anywhere?
  ans:
  - Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices.

- que:
  - You know -- priorities. Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
  ans:
  - You could buy it on payments.

- que:
  - So what do we do?
  ans:
  - Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...

- que:
  - You sure? A Coke or a Perrier or something?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah... 1'm fine...

- que:
  - We're not upset with you, Dave. We think you did a terrific job. Don't we?
  ans:
  - In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.

- que:
  - Extend things?
  ans:
  - Extend them. C'mere for a second.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Well, it's... It's sort of an... an `incident' really...

- que:
  - Will he be alright?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah... probably...

- que:
  - Really? Crazy?
  ans:
  - You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...

- que:
  - Well, let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital. You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - Well... I gues I would... Yeah.

- que:
  - In the car?
  ans:
  - In the car.

- que:
  - The teleprompter. Is it hooked up?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.

- que:
  - Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
  ans:
  - She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Quick. Gimme a quarter.

- que:
  - We vetoed that?
  ans:
  - Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing. Even I don't understand it sometimes. Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...

- que:
  - What do you mean you made it all up?
  ans:
  - We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.

- que:
  - Dave'?
  ans:
  - She knows.

- que:
  - COMMERCE And it's proving quite effective...
  ans:
  - COMMERCE Yes, Mr. President?

- que:
  - Does it make the cars any better?
  ans:
  - COMMERCE No, sir. It's more of a perceptual issue.

- que:
  - Perceptual?
  ans:
  - COMMERCE Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - COMMERCE Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.

- que:
  - So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
  ans:
  - COMMERCE Yes, but I wouldn't...

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - Fertility beads.

- que:
  - Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
  ans:
  - Certainly.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I just fired Bob Alexander.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know. Your first campaign.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.

- que:
  - How'd you get started?
  ans:
  - Oh... Kinda the same way.

- que:
  - You're not?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - We'd like to hire you.

- que:
  - So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
  ans:
  - I can't say.

- que:
  - So you just protect the President the whole time? That's your whole job?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You got a gun?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - You ever use it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.

- que:
  - Didn't mean to bum you out.
  ans:
  - You mean with you and everything?

- que:
  - That's okay. You alright down here by yourself?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The Vice-President...

- que:
  - You sure you don't want a lift back home?
  ans:
  - No thanks. It's not that far.

- que:
  - What are you staring at?
  ans:
  - Uh...

- que:
  - Since when do you care about the homeless?
  ans:
  - I care about the homeless.

- que:
  - I don't understand.
  ans:
  - ... How could I what?

- que:
  - Oh... Yeah.
  ans:
  - What's wrong with a magic trick?

- que:
  - Mind if I sit down?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I mean, what is it? Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.' Where is he?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You're leaving?
  ans:
  - I'm not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn't be here.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Home.

- que:
  - Where's home?
  ans:
  - Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.

- que:
  - You1re leaving, too?
  ans:
  - I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact... I even thought I was helping.

- que:
  - How were you gonna get home?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I hadn't thought it out that far.

- que:
  - You sure this goes somewhere?
  ans:
  - Truman used it all the time.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's just so strange...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here.

- que:
  - You mean when I'm not running the country?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yeah. Is that funny?
  ans:
  - It's just more than anybody else does around here.

- que:
  - It was okay?
  ans:
  - It was inspirational.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I can't.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.

- que:
  - You really believe that?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - ) Thought I needed a little change. You like it?
  ans:
  - It's nice.

- que:
  - So this is it?
  ans:
  - ... Not exactly the Oval Office.

- que:
  - The Monroe?
  ans:
  - Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel...

- que:
  - Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
  ans:
  - We're working on it.

- que:
  - What about the intro?
  ans:
  - It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.

- que:

  ans:
  - Yeah! Tell him off! It couldn't get any worse.

- que:
  - Thigh man? Mr. \"K\" was a hell raiser.
  ans:
  - How was dinner?

- que:
  - What is the Dead Poets Society?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't get it.

- que:
  - But why?
  ans:
  - God, I can't take it anymore! If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.

- que:
  - How'd it go? Did you read it to her?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - What do you mean you don't know?
  ans:
  - How about a trig study group? Right after dinner.

- que:
  - Garden?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - I couldn't stop myself.
  ans:
  - I thought I'd be spontaneous. I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?

- que:
  - But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
  ans:
  - So much the better.

- que:
  - You're siding with Mr. Nolan?! What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - It's such a strange name! Won't you tell us what it means?
  ans:
  - I told you, that's a secret.

- que:
  - Yeah! Don't you guys miss having girls here?
  ans:
  - That's right, it's Nuwanda.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body. You're not like that.

- que:
  - I'm not?
  ans:
  - Doing fine, sir.

- que:
  - Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
  ans:
  - No one, sir. It was just me. I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.

- que:
  - Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
  ans:
  - Yes... sir.

- que:
  - Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
  ans:
  - Yeah, chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.

- que:
  - What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Who's in?
  ans:
  - I'm in.

- que:
  - Charlie, That was great! Where did you learn to play like that?
  ans:
  - My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it. The sax is more sonorous.

- que:
  - Nuwanda, what is going on?
  ans:
  - Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.

- que:
  - Where'd you find them?
  ans:
  - They were walking along the fence past the soccer field. Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.

- que:
  - You what?! How did you do that?
  ans:
  - I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in.

- que:
  - What happened? Were you kicked out?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.

- que:
  - What are you going to do? - Charlie?
  ans:
  - Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.

- que:
  - What good will that do?
  ans:
  - Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.

- que:
  - Stop what?
  ans:
  - Chet...

- que:
  - That's your sister school, right?
  ans:
  - Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.

- que:
  - Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did you bring anybody?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
  ans:
  - You can't be in here.

- que:
  - Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean to make a fool of you.

- que:
  - Just like that?! You just knew?
  ans:
  - Of course just like that. That's how you always know when it's right.

- que:
  - And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
  ans:
  - Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.

- que:
  - Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - Then come with me.

- que:
  - We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
  ans:
  - What is that?

- que:
  - What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
  ans:
  - They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.

- que:
  - Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits. Do you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. The Latin term for that sentiment is \"Carpe Diem.\" Anyone know what that means?
  ans:
  - Carpe Diem... seize the day.

- que:
  - Very good, Mr._?
  ans:
  - Meeks.

- que:
  - The hoi polloi. Doesn't it mean the herd?
  ans:
  - Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time. Why does the poet write these lines?

- que:
  - \"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life.\" Anybody want to read?
  ans:
  - This was my first classroom, John, did you know that? My first desk.

- que:
  - Courtyard?
  ans:
  - Boys marching. Clapping in unison.

- que:
  - John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
  ans:
  - I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.

- que:
  - A yawp?
  ans:
  - A barbaric yawp.

- que:
  - Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain. What was the Dead Poets Society?
  ans:
  - Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.

- que:
  - Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
  ans:
  - Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.

- que:
  - Give your father the benefit of the doubt. Talk to him. Let him see who you are.
  ans:
  - Why do you do it? I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?

- que:
  - Isn't there an easier way?
  ans:
  - Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.

- que:
  - What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Really? You told your father what you told me? You let him see your passion for acting?
  ans:
  - You have another choice.

- que:
  - All right! What'd she say?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - All right. Jesus, what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - What I have to do. Screw the annual.

- que:
  - Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry. Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.

- que:
  - Screw it all. I don't give a damn about any of it.
  ans:
  - But she's in love with, the moron son of my father's best friend. What would the dead poets say about that?

- que:
  - Any group pictures in the annual?
  ans:
  - Nothing. No mention of it.

- que:
  - I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
  ans:
  - Father, I wasn't disputing you.

- que:
  - You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Where is this cave he's talking about?
  ans:
  - Beyond the stream. I think I know.

- que:
  - Forget it, Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, your grades hurting too?
  ans:
  - Look at this.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The god of the cave.

- que:
  - Why'd you leave Balincrest?
  ans:
  - My brother went here.

- que:
  - So what do you think of my father?
  ans:
  - I'll take him over mine.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Want to come to the study group?
  ans:
  - Thanks but I'd better do history.

- que:
  - What is it then?
  ans:
  - I... I just don't want to come.

- que:
  - I don't want to read.
  ans:
  - But why? Don't you understand what Keating is saying? Don't you want to do something about it?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Keating said everybody took turns reading. I don't want to do it.

- que:
  - God, you really have a problem, don't you? How can it hurt you to read? I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
  ans:
  - I've found it.

- que:
  - Found what?
  ans:
  - What I want to do! Right now. What is really inside of me.

- que:
  - A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
  ans:
  - A play, dummy.

- que:
  - I know that. What's it got to do with you?
  ans:
  - They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.

- que:
  - Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
  ans:
  - First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.

- que:
  - Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
  ans:
  - As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.

- que:
  - By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon. You coming?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - What is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.

- que:
  - You want me out... is that what you're saying?
  ans:
  - No, I want you in. But being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in.

- que:
  - Why not? Don't you think you could be?
  ans:
  - Er No.

- que:
  - No? What do you mean 'no'?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Neil, how are you gonna do this?
  ans:
  - Sssh. That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.

- que:
  - From you?
  ans:
  - From my father and Nolan.

- que:
  - Todd, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - It's my birthday.

  - Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
  ans:

  - Huh?
  ans:

  - You think about it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - What do you think about?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.

  - Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
  ans:
  - You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - Pow.

- que:
  - Pow?
  ans:
  - Pow.

- que:
  - From Nam?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow I go with Vince.

- que:
  - Hunt with Vince?
  ans:
  - Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - I thought you might be praying.

- que:
  - Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
  ans:
  - Forget Sal.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.

- que:
  - We gotta play with more bullets.
  ans:
  - Forget Sal?

- que:
  - We what?
  ans:
  - We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.

- que:
  - More bullets in the gun?
  ans:
  - Nick!... I thought you went home.

- que:
  - Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - I like it, Nick.

- que:
  - No.
  ans:
  - Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... Why?

- que:
  - No!!!?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you mean, no?
  ans:
  - As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.

- que:
  - Oh. You know. How's it with you?
  ans:
  - Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

- que:
  - John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna stay here, Nick.

- que:
  - Sal, we need you. We need you.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
  ans:
  - We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.

- que:
  - Did you get one?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Here. Behind you.

- que:
  - Merle? ... Merle's alive? How do you know?
  ans:
  - I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.

- que:
  - Merle gave me this?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
  ans:
  - But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?

- que:
  - Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
  ans:
  - Yeah!

- que:
  - How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
  ans:
  - Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.

- que:
  - Naw. Uh-huh.
  ans:
  - Well, who'd you get married to?

- que:
  - Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Six or eight. And they go wild?
  ans:
  - You're full of shit!

- que:
  - Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
  ans:
  - In the timeless words of Squire Albert...

- que:
  - Up I would say... What would you say?
  ans:
  - Up.

- que:
  - What'cha got, Bennett?
  ans:
  - Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model. I got an artist working on a computer composite now.

- que:
  - Technothugs?
  ans:
  - I can smell it.

- que:
  - Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
  ans:
  - I want this bastard brought down.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Wade's here.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I'd think about it.

- que:
  - My man Dubbs.
  ans:
  - Who is it?

- que:
  - Who are you? What the fuck do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to ask you a few questions.

- que:
  - No, you're not model material. Anything else?
  ans:
  - Funny guy.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Fill it out. Standard issue mal- practice insurance. All Cops carry it.

- que:
  - You son-of-a-bitch. How do you stop it?
  ans:
  - We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.

- que:
  - Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
  ans:
  - Just got the call. Took him from school. Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I'm wasting time.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You were planning to send me back to the ice house. You set me up.

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You have no evidence. Arrest this man.

- que:
  - Tell Doucet that. What was his rehabilitation training?
  ans:
  - Telephone repairman.

- que:
  - How do I look?
  ans:
  - Aces.

- que:
  - Need help?
  ans:
  - I got it. I got it.

- que:
  - Are you a cop?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Does it drive itself, too?
  ans:
  - You have to use the steering wheel to turn. The pedal for gas...

- que:
  - Got it. Ejection seat?
  ans:
  - Lean year for role models.

- que:
  - No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
  ans:
  - Doucet killed my partner.

- que:
  - See those guys?
  ans:
  - Technothugs.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Some things never change.

- que:
  - Wanna come?
  ans:
  - My insurance won't cover it.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Then what goes on in there? What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
  ans:
  - Bacon cheeseburgers.

- que:
  - Give me a break. I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
  ans:
  - Trust me. You don't want to know.

- que:
  - How then?
  ans:
  - You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure. You do it by instinct. Think like him. Do what has to be dane.

- que:
  - GCI. TM-1. What language are you talking?
  ans:
  - I also PVC'd you. Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs. Four honor medals...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I was set up.

- que:
  - It doesn't make sense. Who would want to do that to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.

- que:
  - Engaged. Plan on doing it this summer. You still married?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Least I think so. Twenty- six years this March.

- que:
  - What's this place?
  ans:
  - This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago. Thought maybe he'd come back.

- que:
  - You need anything else?
  ans:
  - I'll be okay.

- que:
  - I'll have a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - Never use it. Stuff'll kill ya.

- que:
  - You want to be a good detective?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Wanna try?
  ans:
  - No thank you, sir. Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.

- que:
  - You're not pregnant, are you?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - What else did he get?
  ans:
  - Wallet, cash, I.D...

- que:
  - Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
  ans:
  - Simulated one.

- que:
  - How do I look?
  ans:
  - Not too good.

- que:
  - Sanchez...?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - ...What are you talking about...?
  ans:
  - Your girl. Being a cop will be rough on her.

- que:
  - ...Have you been drinking?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Aaah... Mother of Jesus.

- que:
  - What is it? Your legs? Hands?
  ans:
  - Hospital food.

- que:
  - What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
  ans:
  - If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.

- que:
  - Says here one of our boys brought him down. You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
  ans:
  - Demolition Man.

- que:
  - What's it mean?
  ans:
  - You never want to find out.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - William Simpson. I like Willy.

- que:
  - Funny. Would you like to buy me a drink?
  ans:
  - This little thing says I can't.

- que:
  - The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
  ans:
  - Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.

- que:
  - Who are these people?
  ans:
  - They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain. Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.

- que:
  - That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel. What did he do?
  ans:
  - He lied to me again.

- que:
  - Lying to you -- Why should I?
  ans:
  - You know that you're in my house.

- que:
  - Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
  ans:
  - Guess there will, if it says so.

- que:
  - And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
  ans:
  - Young man -- you got me there.

- que:
  - And what about Daniel Webster?
  ans:
  - Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.

- que:
  - Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
  ans:
  - Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!

- que:
  - What's that, sir?
  ans:
  - Anybody can see that.

- que:
  - Granny, when do we move to the new house?
  ans:
  - I did not, Grandma.

- que:
  - Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.

- que:
  - Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
  ans:
  - Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.

- que:
  - Loan shark -- hey?
  ans:
  - Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.

- que:
  - Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
  ans:
  - That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.

- que:
  - Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
  ans:
  - Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.

- que:
  - Never mind. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Belle.

- que:
  - I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
  ans:
  - Now run along, Daniel.

- que:
  - Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
  ans:
  - What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?

- que:
  - Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.

- que:
  - Leave your tongue off of that!
  ans:
  - What does it mean here -- about my soul?

- que:
  - My time isn't up yet.
  ans:
  - Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?

- que:
  - Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
  ans:
  - I'm through with you.

- que:
  - Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
  ans:
  - That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.

- que:
  - But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience. Is this your signature?
  ans:
  - You know darn well it is.

- que:
  - Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
  ans:
  - Ten throws it is.

- que:
  - You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.

- que:
  - They make plucky women in New England. H'm ... how long have we to wait?
  ans:
  - Not long -- now.

- que:
  - Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
  ans:
  - You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?

- que:
  - Shall we?
  ans:
  - Why -- good morning, Squire.

- que:
  - Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
  ans:
  - But -- I was just lucky.

- que:
  - Well? Don't a politician have to be?
  ans:
  - Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.

- que:
  - Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
  ans:
  - You really think so?

- que:
  - Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
  ans:
  - The only one you missed -- is the President.

- que:
  - You are not so sure that he'll come.
  ans:
  - You mean that's all you had me come out here for?

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - You're right, Mary.

- que:
  - Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done. Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
  ans:
  - Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.

- que:
  - It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
  ans:
  - That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.

- que:
  - Well -- what are we going to do?
  ans:
  - We can still use my butter money.

- que:
  - Do you think I'm grudging it?
  ans:
  - Mary -- it's gone.

- que:
  - Not all of it?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.

- que:
  - You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
  ans:
  - Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.

- que:
  - Mary -- how do you feel?
  ans:
  - I'll get the doctor.

- que:
  - Mary -- what would you do?
  ans:
  - Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.

- que:
  - Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I'd love to.

- que:
  - What do you think of that, Jabez?
  ans:
  - Looks right elegant, Mary.

- que:
  - You'll never change -- will you?
  ans:
  - I am going to lock him up.

- que:
  - Isn't that your own fault?
  ans:
  - My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.

- que:
  - I don't know, Jabez.
  ans:
  - Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?

- que:
  - Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
  ans:
  - It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.

- que:
  - Mary! Come back ...
  ans:
  - What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?

- que:
  - Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
  ans:
  - Oh, Jabez! ... Did you hear, Mr. Webster? -- Now you'll help him, won't you?

- que:
  - That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
  ans:
  - I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.

- que:
  - What's ailing that dog?
  ans:
  - Well -- that's comforting! Supper.

- que:
  - Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
  ans:
  - Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.

- que:
  - Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
  ans:
  - I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.

- que:
  - Do you really think that?
  ans:
  - I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --

- que:
  - Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
  ans:
  - I say -- it don't matter.

- que:
  - What a nice -- and kind girl -- Who is she --?
  ans:
  - The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.

- que:
  - So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
  ans:
  - What mountain?

- que:
  - You aren't angry with me?
  ans:
  - Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.

- que:
  - What are you looking for, Colonel? What's your name?
  ans:
  - Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.

- que:
  - Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
  ans:
  - Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?

- que:
  - Jabez ...
  ans:
  - Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?

- que:
  - Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
  ans:
  - I'll do my best, Mary.

- que:
  - There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
  ans:
  - She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.

- que:
  - Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
  ans:
  - Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Oh .. not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.

- que:
  - There, Mr. Webster. All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
  ans:
  - Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster! Cup for cup -- what do you say?

- que:
  - Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
  ans:
  - Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.

- que:
  - You mean -- a jury trial?
  ans:
  - Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --

- que:
  - Why don't you?
  ans:
  - I can't be honest with them.

- que:
  - Argyle. Don't you take this stuff?
  ans:
  - Do I? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to help me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.

- que:
  - If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears. ...Or is he married?
  ans:
  - Married.

- que:
  - The girl was off today. Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front. So, your lady live out here?
  ans:
  - The past six months.

- que:
  - You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
  ans:
  - It's okay, it's okay.

- que:
  - So, you divorced of what?
  ans:
  - She had a good job, it turned into a great career.

- que:
  - You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
  ans:
  - Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.

- que:
  - How 'bout some Christmas music?
  ans:
  - That is Christmas music.

- que:
  - What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
  ans:
  - I'll find someplace.

- que:
  - One of yours?
  ans:
  - They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.

- que:
  - The police...?
  ans:
  - John.

- que:
  - How about his job?
  ans:
  - His 'job' is 3000 miles away. Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. Hi there.

- que:
  - Ellis, what have you told them?
  ans:
  - You're very perceptive.

- que:
  - I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
  ans:
  - The guy upstairs who's fucking things up? I can give him to you.

- que:
  - Yes...I know about them. The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
  ans:
  - See to Heinrich... Now...you can break the code key...?

- que:
  - Bad for your health anyway.
  ans:
  - You want...money? What kind of terrorists are you?

- que:
  - I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
  ans:
  - Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers. I really dug those sequined shirts.

- que:
  - Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
  ans:
  - Only if New Jersey counts.

- que:
  - They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
  ans:
  - Better than being caught with your pants down, right? John McClane.

- que:
  - Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
  ans:
  - Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'? Now you are fucked.

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.

- que:
  - Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
  ans:
  - You did. You murdered by Boss. Now... They're looking to me. Personally I'd pass on the jab. I don't enjoy being this close to you.

- que:
  - No. But I'll have a sofa brought out to you. Good enough?
  ans:
  - Good enough. And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.

- que:
  - Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
  ans:
  - Gennero. Miss Gennero.

- que:
  - Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync. I think it's me. Is there a place I can wash up?
  ans:
  - Sure. Follow me.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It's a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.

- que:
  - Oh...Where does he live?
  ans:
  - Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.

- que:
  - They would, huh?
  ans:
  - So I've heard.

- que:
  - Can I get you anything? Food? Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. You throw quite a party. I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I hear you... Partner. And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.

- que:
  - Uh, what do I call you?
  ans:
  - Roy'.

- que:
  - I said we'll talk later, Roy. If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
  ans:
  - I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy. Let's talk later, okay?

- que:
  - The plastique I found. Is the building on fire?
  ans:
  - No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors. One spotters say you got two with that blast.

- que:
  - Two? Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Hey, I love you. So do a lot of the guys. So hang in there, man. Hang in there.

- que:
  - You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
  ans:

  - What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
  ans:
  - Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

- que:
  - Captain Rob came back?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.

- que:
  - HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.

  - The answer is George Jefferson.
  ans:
  - No one knows?
