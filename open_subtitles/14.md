- que:
  - dad?

  - yes.
  ans:
  - where'd the fish go?

- que:
  - under what circumstances might one become a slave among the mende, of which you claim to belong?
  ans:
  - translate.

- que:
  - and how many men are indebted to you?
  ans:
  - i don't think you do see.

- que:
  - now, he is familiar with the concept.
  ans:
  - do these workers own the land they work on?

- que:
  - when you come down to it, it's all about money, isn't it?
  ans:
  - slaves, production, money.

- que:
  - do your people routinely slaughter their slaves in the manner that you just so vividly described to us?
  ans:
  - of course they don't.

- que:
  - how do you explain that paradox?
  ans:
  - i don't understand what you mean.

- que:
  - because?
  ans:
  - not even unusual, regrettably.

- que:
  - what, if anything, in his account of his ordeal, do you find believable?
  ans:
  - his description of the slave fortress, for one thing.

- que:
  - you've seen it?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - rumour?
  ans:
  - reports.

- que:
  - by \"reports \"you mean of the variety cinque shared with us today?
  ans:
  - its existence, sir, has been reported.

- que:
  - drown hundreds of people?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - from the tecora?
  ans:
  - if you look, there's a notation made on may 10, correcting the number of slaves on board, reducing their number by 50.

- que:
  - i may need a quill and parchment and a better imagination.
  ans:
  - what does that mean?

- que:
  - a mast and sails, perhaps?
  ans:
  - give us... us... free.

- que:
  - who is he?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but everywhere he goes he is followed by the sun.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - he could also walk across the sea.

- que:
  - what did we do?
  ans:
  - whatever it was, it was serious enough to kill him for it.

- que:
  - do you want to see how they killed him?
  ans:
  - this is just a story, yamba.

- que:
  - were they born in africa?
  ans:
  - since the answer to that question shall govern every determination of this court, i ask it again.

- que:
  - were they born in africa?
  ans:
  - i believe they were.

- que:
  - mr president?
  ans:
  - senator calhoun is here.

- que:
  - what president wants to be in office... when it comes crashing down around him?
  ans:
  - certainly no court before this one.

- que:
  - our president, our big, big man, has appealed the decision to our supreme court.
  ans:
  - whoa!

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - we have to try the case again.

- que:
  - you can't translate what?
  ans:
  - i can't translate \"should\".

- que:
  - there's no mende word for \"should\"?
  ans:
  - yes, cinque.

- que:
  - mr tippings, excuse me a moment, please.
  ans:
  - what kind of place is this?

- que:
  - what did cinque say?
  ans:
  - he won't talk to you.

- que:
  - he won't talk to me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how's your english coming?
  ans:
  - no better than my mende, i suppose.

- que:
  - cinque, i know this isn't something you necessarily want to think about, but has it occurred to you that i'm all you've got?
  ans:
  - because, since my practice has now completely deteriorated, you're all i've got.

- que:
  - you see how this works?
  ans:
  - and and and this, this here, cinque, is for me.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - more death threats.

- que:
  - i should say, should say... former clients, shouldn't i?
  ans:
  - there is one more consequence to having no clientele to speak of.

- que:
  - yes, you understood that word, didn't you?
  ans:
  - free.

- que:
  - is that him?
  ans:
  - yes, mr president.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i was talking about john...

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - cinque has asked me t t to ask you... whether you have thought about the question of jurisdiction.

- que:
  - that since they took over the ship far out to sea, and since neither spain nor america owns the sea, how is it that the treaty applies?
  ans:
  - tell him the treaty recognises no jurisdictional limitations.

- que:

- que:
  - alone?
  ans:
  - indeed not.

- que:

  ans:
  - and now would have us disregard truth even as it stands before us, tall and proud as a mountain.

- que:
  - a court that finds against the africans?
  ans:
  - well, i think not.

- que:
  - we can all see that.

  - i said, what season is it?
  ans:
  - i don't understand what you mean.

- que:
  - do you really think van buren cares about the whims of an 11 year old girl who wears a tiara?
  ans:
  - i assure you, only one thing occupies his thoughts this time of the year, being all things to all people, which means nothing to no one.

- que:
  - will you help us, sir?
  ans:
  - let go of my arm.

- que:
  - as an advocate for the abolition of slavery, will you help us?
  ans:
  - i'm neither friend nor foe to the abolitionist cause.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i know you, mr president.

- que:
  - you're quite the scholar, mr joadson, aren't ya?
  ans:
  - quite the historian.

- que:
  - what are they worth to you?
  ans:
  - we're discussing the case, not its expense.

- que:
  - i'm right, aren't i?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - \"are they?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - the what?
  ans:
  - it would be against everything i stand for to let this deteriorate into an exercise in legal minutia.

- que:
  - did christ hire a lawyer to get him off on technicalities?
  ans:
  - he went to the cross, nobly.

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:
  - to make a statement.

- que:
  - you want to win, don't you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - who are they, do you think?
  ans:
  - looks like they're going to be sick.

- que:
  - you want to sit?
  ans:
  - sit here in mendeland.

- que:
  - you want trouble?
  ans:
  - cross into our territory again.

- que:
  - let me show you to sherbroland.
  ans:
  - what is this?

- que:
  - there?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - keep talking.

- que:
  - have you seen this before?
  ans:
  - i could kill you with my bare hands before you raise that sword.

- que:
  - this belongs to you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - i didn't understand a word.

- que:
  - do you think he's here to help us?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - is this where you're from?
  ans:
  - a fri ca.

- que:
  - what does he want?
  ans:
  - he's an idiot.

- que:
  - were you born in the west indies?
  ans:
  - all three of them are idiots.

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - oh, he said, er...

- que:
  - i cannot overstate... have you figured out who he is?
  ans:
  - an advisor of some kind.

- que:
  - what about him?
  ans:
  - the simple cook, a creole...

- que:
  - and dung scraper?
  ans:
  - i have a horrible feeling he talks for us.

- que:
  - or how about... a polecat and a president?
  ans:
  - the spanish government hopes you don't have much more sense than that.

- que:
  - i thought he was born on a cuban plantation?
  ans:
  - perhaps he simply doesn't like you.

- que:
  - on spanish plantations, slaves choose to live surrounded by their own ways and simple languages.
  ans:
  - what, did he learn this on some cuban plantation, this decorative effect?

- que:
  - stop?
  ans:
  - gestures suffice for slaves, as for any other beast of burden.

- que:
  - is that correct?
  ans:
  - i have them.

- que:
  - you do?
  ans:
  - much better than i expected, to be honest.

- que:
  - how can i explain to you where we're from?
  ans:
  - you go.

- que:
  - now, cuba... is this your home?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - this is your home, isn't it?
  ans:
  - this... is... your home.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - you came... all the way... from... here.

- que:
  - what did they want?
  ans:
  - to come aboard.

- que:
  - light...?
  ans:
  - light the lamp, mr baldwin.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how, then, can the portuguese tecora... engage in the slave trades in these waters?
  ans:
  - there's nothing there.

- que:
  - what did i do to deserve this?
  ans:
  - you took the case, mr baldwin.

- que:
  - over this?
  ans:
  - it's worse than that.

- que:
  - what could be worse than that?
  ans:
  - calhoun believes, and i am not sure i can disagree with him, that this could take us all one long step closer to civil war.

- que:
  - this?
  ans:
  - yes, mr president.

- que:
  - they can?
  ans:
  - but i believe we must go further and remove the judge.

- que:
  - we can do that?
  ans:
  - he could be prevailed upon to recuse himself for various reasons.

- que:
  - he's catholic?
  ans:
  - his grandfather was catholic, which young mr coglin has striven all his days to keep quiet.

- que:
  - what to do now, eh?
  ans:
  - which is why i came here and imposed on you, sir.

- que:
  - how did that young lawyer take the news?
  ans:
  - oh, in stride, sir.

- que:
  - did he?
  ans:
  - oh, yes, sir.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - mr president, if it was you handling the case...

- que:
  - i'm much obliged for your time, sir.
  ans:
  - but if it was, sir, huh?

- que:
  - what is their story?
  ans:
  - why, they're, um,... from west africa.

- que:
  - mr joadson, you're from where originally?
  ans:
  - why, georgia, sir.

- que:
  - is that your story?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - that's your story, isn't it?
  ans:
  - you and this young so called lawyer have proven you know what they are.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - seven.

- que:
  - would you like to count from one to ten?
  ans:
  - one to ten in mende.

- que:
  - what's happened here?
  ans:
  - one of them died last night.

- que:
  - they want to live with it?
  ans:
  - they want to bury him.

- que:
  - the clothes?
  ans:
  - and the names.

- que:
  - how is that possible?
  ans:
  - a chief cannot be replaced.

- que:
  - what's this i hear about a lion?
  ans:
  - they say you alone alone, cinque slew the most terrifying beast anyone has ever seen.

- que:
  - is it not true?
  ans:
  - it had killed several people.

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - i'm not a big man.

- que:
  - that too was an accident?
  ans:
  - i hardly think so.

- que:
  - under what circumstances might one become a slave among the mende, of which you claim to belong?
  ans:
  - translate.

- que:
  - and how many men are indebted to you?
  ans:
  - i don't think you do see.

- que:
  - now, he is familiar with the concept.
  ans:
  - do these workers own the land they work on?

- que:
  - when you come down to it, it's all about money, isn't it?
  ans:
  - slaves, production, money.

- que:
  - do your people routinely slaughter their slaves in the manner that you just so vividly described to us?
  ans:
  - of course they don't.

- que:
  - how do you explain that paradox?
  ans:
  - i don't understand what you mean.

- que:
  - because?
  ans:
  - not even unusual, regrettably.

- que:
  - what, if anything, in his account of his ordeal, do you find believable?
  ans:
  - his description of the slave fortress, for one thing.

- que:
  - you've seen it?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - rumour?
  ans:
  - reports.

- que:
  - by \"reports \"you mean of the variety cinque shared with us today?
  ans:
  - its existence, sir, has been reported.

- que:
  - drown hundreds of people?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - from the tecora?
  ans:
  - if you look, there's a notation made on may 10, correcting the number of slaves on board, reducing their number by 50.

- que:
  - i may need a quill and parchment and a better imagination.
  ans:
  - what does that mean?

- que:
  - a mast and sails, perhaps?
  ans:
  - give us... us... free.

- que:
  - who is he?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but everywhere he goes he is followed by the sun.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - he could also walk across the sea.

- que:
  - what did we do?
  ans:
  - whatever it was, it was serious enough to kill him for it.

- que:
  - do you want to see how they killed him?
  ans:
  - this is just a story, yamba.

- que:
  - were they born in africa?
  ans:
  - since the answer to that question shall govern every determination of this court, i ask it again.

- que:
  - were they born in africa?
  ans:
  - i believe they were.

- que:
  - mr president?
  ans:
  - senator calhoun is here.

- que:
  - what president wants to be in office... when it comes crashing down around him?
  ans:
  - certainly no court before this one.

- que:
  - our president, our big, big man, has appealed the decision to our supreme court.
  ans:
  - whoa!

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - we have to try the case again.

- que:
  - you can't translate what?
  ans:
  - i can't translate \"should\".

- que:
  - there's no mende word for \"should\"?
  ans:
  - yes, cinque.

- que:
  - mr tippings, excuse me a moment, please.
  ans:
  - what kind of place is this?

- que:
  - what did cinque say?
  ans:
  - he won't talk to you.

- que:
  - he won't talk to me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how's your english coming?
  ans:
  - no better than my mende, i suppose.

- que:
  - cinque, i know this isn't something you necessarily want to think about, but has it occurred to you that i'm all you've got?
  ans:
  - because, since my practice has now completely deteriorated, you're all i've got.

- que:
  - you see how this works?
  ans:
  - and and and this, this here, cinque, is for me.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - more death threats.

- que:
  - i should say, should say... former clients, shouldn't i?
  ans:
  - there is one more consequence to having no clientele to speak of.

- que:
  - yes, you understood that word, didn't you?
  ans:
  - free.

- que:
  - is that him?
  ans:
  - yes, mr president.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i was talking about john...

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - cinque has asked me t t to ask you... whether you have thought about the question of jurisdiction.

- que:
  - that since they took over the ship far out to sea, and since neither spain nor america owns the sea, how is it that the treaty applies?
  ans:
  - tell him the treaty recognises no jurisdictional limitations.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - now, you understand you're going to the supreme court.
  ans:
  - does america have treaties with west africa?

  ans:
  - when someone is taken from us at such a young age, we often ourselves why.

  - you waved?
  ans:
  - he was clearing my driveway.

- que:
  - was he much of an outdoo rsman or ahiker or...?
  ans:
  - i thought it was paul at first.

  - have you talked to paul's wife?
  ans:
  - now there's a story.

- que:
  - did you say you thought it was paul that did your driveway?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - why is god, who is a loving god, capable of such things?
  ans:
  - when someone is taken from us at such a young age, we often ourselves why.

- que:
  - what possible purpose could this serve?
  ans:
  - but i believe the apostle paul, writing to the ephesians, said it best when he said \"all things are done according to god's will.

- que:
  - sweetheart, why don't you go sit in the car and warm up, okay?
  ans:
  - okey dokey, smokey.

  ans:
  - i called them.

- que:
  - ls that where they came in?
  ans:
  - yeah, through that big hole in the roof.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - let's just clear it and get going, okay?
  ans:
  - i should tell you, we also had some vcrs we were holding for another company.

- que:
  - you try to rape me, i swear to christ, i'il bite it off.
  ans:
  - wanna wrap this up, cam?

- que:
  - what the hell happened to your face?
  ans:
  - jesus, you look like you ran into...

- que:
  - so what now, you gonna get me smoking from both ends?
  ans:
  - i just came here to look around and she started hitting me and yelling at me.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - after we get her back from these guys who grabbed her do you think your wife's gonna be able to keep her pretty little mouth shut?
  ans:
  - that'd be a first.

- que:
  - think about what?
  ans:
  - all i'm saying is, sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions.

  - ls that jailhouse humor?
  ans:
  - still...

  ans:
  - the police say they found raymond's wallet and that's how they tracked you down.

- que:
  - any idea what he was doing out there?
  ans:
  - he'd take walks.

- que:
  - can i get you a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - no, thank you.

- que:
  - was he a big hiker?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i don't follow.

- que:
  - may i ask why you need to know all this?
  ans:
  - just trying to tie up some loose ends, mr. barnell.

- que:
  - now, you do cover that sort of thing, don't you?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, mr. barnell, and it shouldn't take more than a few days.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - i took some adavan.

- que:
  - i'm really, really sick, you know?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - but maybe it's not what we think it is, you know?
  ans:
  - yeah, maybe it's not.

- que:
  - remember that cruise?
  ans:
  - i saw you.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - but you have to leave everything up to me, okay?
  ans:
  - you leave everything up to me, and you're gonna be okay.

- que:
  - oh, can you take care of that for me?
  ans:
  - i'm kinda working on something here, cam.

- que:
  - you're not still on the barnell thing, are you?
  ans:
  - i went to go see him.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - so, trust me, something's not right.

- que:
  - no more cam goes to the coffee room and ted disappears for three hours?
  ans:
  - i'il try, yeah.

- que:
  - and you'il work on your interpersonal skills?
  ans:

- que:
  - are all these yours?
  ans:
  - greatest sport on earth.

- que:
  - tea okay?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - i was just wondering, did you happen to talk to raymond when he got back?
  ans:
  - only saw him the once.

- que:
  - you waved?
  ans:
  - he was clearing my driveway.

- que:
  - was he much of an outdoo rsman or ahiker or...?
  ans:
  - i thought it was paul at first.

- que:
  - have you talked to paul's wife?
  ans:
  - now there's a story.

- que:
  - did you say you thought it was paul that did your driveway?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - why is god, who is a loving god, capable of such things?
  ans:
  - when someone is taken from us at such a young age, we often ourselves why.

- que:
  - what possible purpose could this serve?
  ans:
  - but i believe the apostle paul, writing to the ephesians, said it best when he said \"all things are done according to god's will.

- que:
  - sweetheart, why don't you go sit in the car and warm up, okay?
  ans:
  - okey dokey, smokey.

- que:
  - they really don't give people a moment's peace, do they?
  ans:
  - i called them.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - they wanted to talk to me about raymond, and i thought now would be an appropriate time.

- que:
  - where's your mommy?
  ans:
  - for the cruise ship trade, mostly.

- que:
  - is that where they came in?
  ans:
  - yeah, through that big hole in the roof.

- que:
  - how much?
  ans:
  - we figure about two hundred grand.

- que:
  - ted?
  ans:
  - maybe we should take a look at the irinventory list first.

- que:
  - let's just clear it and get going, okay?
  ans:
  - i should tell you, we also had some vcrs we were holding for another company.

- que:
  - you try to rape me, i swear to christ, i'il bite it off.
  ans:
  - wanna wrap this up, cam?

- que:
  - what the hell happened to your face?
  ans:
  - jesus, you look like you ran into...

- que:
  - so what now, you gonna get me smoking from both ends?
  ans:
  - i just came here to look around and she started hitting me and yelling at me.

- que:
  - is this how you solve our problem?
  ans:
  - i didn't have any choice.

- que:
  - just listen to me, okay?
  ans:
  - yeah, listen.

- que:
  - your place?
  ans:
  - no, it's too small.

- que:
  - with bubbles?
  ans:
  - it'd be like a little getaway.

- que:
  - what the hell are you doing in our house?
  ans:
  - mr. barnell.

- que:
  - you hear that, gary?
  ans:
  - he don't know what we're talking about.

- que:
  - so how much did you get?
  ans:
  - we had a life insurance policy on my brother and we could get... one hundred thousand dollars.

- que:
  - you stay here?
  ans:
  - just for a bit.

- que:
  - is there something wrong?
  ans:
  - hello, brother.

  ans:

- que:
  - what'd you get?
  ans:
  - fifty thousand.

- que:
  - how's she holding up, anyway?
  ans:
  - we're having problems.

- que:
  - you still can't get one past the goalie, huh?
  ans:
  - well, it's best not to send a boy to do a man's job.

- que:
  - so how come you talk like you do?
  ans:
  - i mean, cursing all the time.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:

  ans:
  - you are so faking it.

- que:
  - you put that down now, you little bitch, or so help me i'il start yelling so loud, you'il have to shoot me.

- que:
  - dead guy's got a record?
  ans:
  - yeah, he beat some guy up in a bar fight.

- que:
  - honey?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - after we get her back from these guys who grabbed her do you think your wife's gonna be able to keep her pretty little mouth shut?
  ans:
  - that'd be a first.

- que:
  - think about what?
  ans:
  - all i'm saying is, sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions.

- que:
  - is that jailhouse humor?
  ans:
  - still...

- que:
  - mr. barnell, why are you staying out here?
  ans:
  - my wife and i we're having a few problems.

- que:
  - what's $2 million to a real estate billionaire?

  - the upkeep of his private jet is worth more than that.

- que:
  - you thought i looked sexy?

  - you are sexy.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - we used to make love all the time, and now there's always an excuse.

  ans:
  - his wife had died the year before.

- que:
  - you think he's right for her?

  - so, what did he say?
  ans:
  - that steve is inclined to put up the money.

- que:
  - remember greg earlinger?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why would he be interested in her?
  ans:
  - she seemed quite pretty, she's offbeat and greg always likes complicated women.

- que:
  - ask her if we can give him her number, ok?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - nice to meet you.

- que:

  ans:
  - i moved there for him.

- que:
  - yes, but where's the attraction?
  ans:
  - he just knew how to touch me.

- que:
  - you mean emotionally?
  ans:
  - no, with his hands.

- que:
  - am i being too frank?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - why did your marriage fail again?
  ans:
  - he was cheating with his secretary.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - steve is putting up the money for my film.

- que:
  - what did you do today?
  ans:
  - i told you.

- que:
  - with who?
  ans:
  - with me, with me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - remember greg earlinger, doug's dentist?
  ans:
  - we met him once.

- que:
  - kind of an unjustified self confidence?
  ans:
  - as i recall, it was justified.

- que:
  - what does she wanna do with a dentist?
  ans:
  - she was already married to a doctor.

- que:
  - i mean, who goes on safaris?
  ans:
  - you need shots to do that.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:

- que:
  - you're certainly a natural for the character.
  ans:
  - what are you doing down here?

- que:

  ans:
  - you've said it a hundred times.

- que:
  - you see me like that, don't you?
  ans:
  - i'm asking.

- que:
  - is that how you see me?
  ans:
  - i'm really happy for you.

- que:
  - can't we leave it at that?
  ans:
  - i'm wired.

- que:
  - shall we go out to dinner and celebrate?
  ans:
  - tonight's cassie's party.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - the silk one is sexier, but this one's elegant.

- que:
  - you think the silk one's sexier?
  ans:
  - so maybe i should wear this.

- que:
  - fat?
  ans:
  - melinda, everyone should be so fat.

- que:
  - doesn't she?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - plus an empty stomach with pills?
  ans:
  - vodka's not fattening.

- que:
  - how did i wind up desperate?
  ans:
  - because that's what i am, laurel.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why don't you get laurel pregnant?
  ans:
  - then you wouldn't need to make arrangements.

- que:
  - how's our matchmaking going?
  ans:
  - they seem to be hitting it off well.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you?
  ans:
  - the great thing about hiking is you're free.

- que:
  - i've tried to explain it all to emily, including the whole religious aspect, but what the hell?
  ans:
  - she's four.

- que:
  - would you excuse me?
  ans:
  - laurel, you know this one.

- que:
  - are your eyes misting over?
  ans:
  - this song, it's meaningful to me.

- que:
  - well, aren't those the same tears?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - why do things that start off so promisingly always have a way of ending up in the dump?
  ans:
  - not for everyone.

- que:
  - is that really your name?
  ans:
  - yes, it is.

- que:
  - is that what you wanna be another verdi or puccini?
  ans:
  - i don't kid myself, you know, but, yeah.

- que:
  - and you?
  ans:
  - i don't write opera, but my life has been one.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - well, your eyes, your voice.

- que:
  - i gotta go back and play, but could we have lunch, you know, or dinner?
  ans:
  - you can certainly have my number, if that's what you're asking.

- que:
  - laurel?
  ans:
  - i dated a laurel.

- que:
  - his opera was a big success at yale and they're doing the other one where?
  ans:

  - god, he's incredible, isn't he?
  ans:
  - it'd be great for melinda if things worked out.

- que:

- que:
  - now, can i talk to you for a minute?
  ans:
  - and try not to get upset.

- que:
  - you wanna spend more time in the hamptons whether i go with you or not?
  ans:

- que:
  - there's a tick in my leg.
  ans:
  - flanders?

- que:
  - where's greg?
  ans:
  - he's a dentist.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - but try not to panic.

- que:
  - and you would be totally cool if you had a live insect crawling around under your skin?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't enjoy it, but i wouldn't panic.

- que:
  - my neck?
  ans:
  - your neck.

- que:
  - my neck?
  ans:

  - so, what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - i don't know if i should feel sorry for myself or shop to blot out my depression.

  ans:
  - i haven't been able to tell her that.

- que:
  - you don't know if she feels the same?
  ans:
  - no, i think she does.

- que:
  - well, why can't you just tell her it's not working any more?
  ans:
  - i don't wanna hurt her.

- que:
  - how wise is it to get involved with a woman with melinda's track record?
  ans:
  - that's why i'm convinced i'm in love with her, because there's no logical reason to be.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:

- que:
  - but what makes you think that something's going on?
  ans:
  - i thought it was my paranoia.

- que:
  - who was here?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - we are being attacked.

- que:
  - i know that, but by who?
  ans:
  - balloons.

- que:
  - from fire?
  ans:
  - i didn't see them coming.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i have to say goodbye now.

- que:
  - can you reach it?
  ans:
  - yes, i can.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i'm coming with you.

- que:
  - xev?
  ans:
  - kai, you fly, i'il help xev.

- que:
  - xev, is that you?
  ans:
  - it is xev.

- que:
  - xev, xev?
  ans:
  - i don't get it.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - kai can't be killed, he's already dead.

- que:
  - correct?
  ans:
  - my prince thinks of everything.

- que:
  - so, we have you, and stanley and your dead man are out of the picture, isn't that excellent?
  ans:
  - wonderful.

- que:
  - don't you have a mind of your own?
  ans:
  - oooo...

- que:
  - am i beautiful?
  ans:
  - the most.

- que:
  - witty?
  ans:
  - the sharpest.

- que:
  - do you love me?
  ans:
  - completely.

- que:
  - would you die for me?
  ans:
  - now the game will become more interesting.

- que:
  - a defeat?
  ans:
  - for them.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - rise above all the others.

- que:
  - her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - don't you want to rescue xev?
  ans:
  - well, yeah kai, but we gotta get some help first.

- que:
  - ok, what do you suggest then?
  ans:
  - engage the other balloons in battle, to save xev now on our own.

- que:
  - but what but they're all around us, how can we attack them all?
  ans:
  - we will not have to attack them.

- que:
  - what are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - whatever we can.

- que:
  - did they hit us?
  ans:
  - not where it matters.

- que:
  - would you care for a drink?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - well what can we do?
  ans:
  - we can wait.

- que:
  - wait for what?
  ans:
  - for them to make a mistake.

- que:
  - that's our entire plan?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - yeah, well what if they don't make a mistake?
  ans:
  - then they will succeed and we will fail.

- que:
  - and i will sink to the centre of this planet.
  ans:
  - what does that mean?

- que:
  - why is it that i do all the pumping and you do all the standing around?
  ans:
  - i will pump if you request, but then i will not be able to stop darts.

- que:
  - did they get the balloon?
  ans:
  - not yet.

- que:
  - why do you do this?
  ans:
  - i tempt those who can be tempted, and i punish those who deserve to be punished.

- que:
  - what is wrong with that?
  ans:
  - and i also punish some who have done nothing wrong, who slip through the cracks but then, no system is perfect.

- que:
  - your childhood, xev of b3k?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so what do we do?
  ans:
  - we wait.

- que:
  - what is the correct answer?
  ans:
  - xev of b3k always flatter your man.

- que:
  - do you remember that?
  ans:
  - it's all a blur.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - should we fire everything at them now?
  ans:
  - firing everything at them will have no effect on the dead man.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - we wait for him to make a mistake.

- que:
  - listen kai, why don't you just, you know, do the assassination thing with your brace and get this over with?
  ans:
  - i would, if my brace were fully functional, but it is not.

- que:
  - what, what's the deal?
  ans:
  - the ten seconds were up, so i cut the cord like you said.

- que:
  - why don't we just crash, down in the water?
  ans:
  - in that case, i would be fine, but you and xev would become very easy targets.

- que:
  - release the stays?
  ans:
  - yes, we must release the stays which suspend the gondola from the balloon now.

- que:
  - look.
  ans:
  - how can they get any higher?

- que:
  - shall i release the mainstay?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how can we make it to the lexx?
  ans:
  - we will have to be very lucky.

- que:
  - what weight?
  ans:
  - nearly.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i have to release the mainstay from up here or else i will go down with the gondola.

- que:
  - is that clear enough for you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - well what, what now?
  ans:
  - look, there.

- que:
  - you're not actually suggesting that i let go and throw myself down there, and if i'm incredibly lucky land on prince's balloon, are ya?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - well how?
  ans:
  - no no no no.

- que:
  - your brace isn't working right, remember?
  ans:
  - hopefully, you will still be close enough.

- que:
  - a moth?
  ans:
  - we don't have time.

- que:
  - do these mothbreeders ever stop?
  ans:
  - i must build more moths.

- que:
  - are you one of the mothbreeders who were taken to duketown?
  ans:
  - i must build more moths.

- que:
  - me again.
  ans:
  - can you understand that, even a little?

- que:
  - how did you get here?
  ans:
  - i died.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i want to be with you when you die.

- que:
  - what makes you think that i'm going to die?
  ans:
  - you're on the surface of the planet fire, the sun's up you cannot last the hour.

- que:
  - and you?
  ans:
  - oh, i will also die.

- que:
  - do you know what a cluster lizard is?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - how does that matter?
  ans:
  - you will see.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - in less than an hour.

- que:
  - how are you going?
  ans:
  - fine, thank you.

- que:
  - why aren't you dying?
  ans:
  - i'm very good with heat.

- que:
  - how is it that you're not dying?
  ans:
  - i'm not all human.

- que:
  - can you still find whatever memory you want with your hand, like you did before?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you still feel anything for me?
  ans:
  - a little.

- que:
  - hey, look, look, do you see it?
  ans:
  - ohhh... la.

- que:
  - why else would they call themselves silent?
  ans:
  - they're a life force, not an embassy.

  ans:
  - it's fine in principle, scotty.

- que:
  - wouldn't you say, ambassador?
  ans:
  - you know, for quite a while i was skeptical...... about this extraordinarily silent opposition.

- que:
  - might i offer myself as a go between, so to speak...... to verify andy's dispersal of these funds?
  ans:
  - kind of you to offer, ambassador.

- que:
  - we have a lot to catch up on, eh?
  ans:

  - he was just looking for a good enough excuse.
  ans:
  - when?

- que:
  - shall i close his eyes?
  ans:
  - you must go now, harry.

- que:
  - darling, what?
  ans:
  - i need to talk to ernesto.

- que:
  - will you vouch for me, my credentials?
  ans:
  - i need to get on a plane.

- que:
  - you wish for this man to be included?
  ans:
  - i've never seen him before.

- que:
  - could this be the beginning of a beautiful friendship?
  ans:
  - i think it desperately unlikely.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

  ans:
  - not as such.

- que:
  - why didn't you just tell me from the start?
  ans:
  - because i fell in love with you, my princess.

- que:
  - where were you?
  ans:
  - oh, sarah.

- que:
  - what do i want you to do?
  ans:
  - what you always do.

- que:
  - can we have pancakes?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - breakfast?
  ans:
  - well, there's two ways we can deal with this one, my dear.

- que:
  - i should have cut that branch, but i got greedy.
  ans:
  - ready?

- que:
  - why do you ask me that?
  ans:
  - when i get close to you, you edge away.

- que:
  - how am i supposed to show you what i do if i ain't allow to touch you?
  ans:
  - you tried to kiss me.

- que:
  - why do you find me so repugnant?
  ans:
  - i don't find you repugnant.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - chuck, i've treated you unfairly.

- que:
  - you've really been alone up here, haven't you?
  ans:
  - you haven't had anyone to comfort you and i should ask you for forgiveness.

- que:
  - still friends?
  ans:
  - sorry...

- que:
  - were you asleep?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you want me to leave?
  ans:
  - no, i was just resting.

- que:
  - you can see through it all, can't you?
  ans:
  - i'il tell you, i'm gonna be asleep in two minutes.

- que:
  - what if i don't want you to go to sleep?
  ans:
  - i don't think you have a choice tonight.

- que:
  - jason, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - that's wrong.

- que:
  - how's that for dividing the words?
  ans:
  - this is not a good day.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - i can be very bad.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i've been mean lately.

- que:
  - i should hit you?
  ans:
  - i'm not gonna do that.

- que:
  - it's good having ma on your side, right?
  ans:
  - it'd be pretty serious if she turned against you.

- que:
  - maybe i should go stand in the corner and be ashamed?
  ans:
  - i don't care...

- que:
  - the fbl?
  ans:
  - they were most interested in hearing what i'd seen in the past six months, anything related to that wanted poster.

- que:
  - what did you tell them?
  ans:
  - well, i thought i'd seen something in the woods recently.

- que:
  - why would i wanna run away, chuck?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't try to holler, either.

- que:
  - why would i wanna do that?
  ans:
  - she's at my place.

- que:
  - is she busy?
  ans:
  - not anymore.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - you hit jason.

- que:
  - how could you do such a thing?
  ans:
  - i know it sounds implausible, but he was asking for it.

- que:
  - sleeping at night?
  ans:
  - martha saw a certain tom edison jr.

- que:
  - oh, no?
  ans:
  - we all saw you take his hand to the picnic.

- que:
  - maybe that wasn't flirting?
  ans:
  - yes...

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - are the police on canyon road again?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - it's funny you should mention canyon road, though... right, martha?
  ans:
  - she was just there this morning.

- que:
  - do you know that spot, martha?
  ans:
  - yes i do.

- que:
  - and did you stop there to enjoy the view this morning?
  ans:
  - it's harvest time, you know, in the orchard after all.

- que:
  - what do you want with my husband?
  ans:
  - i don't want anything with your husband or anybody.

- que:
  - what about tom and the hand holding at the picnic?
  ans:
  - that's different.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - remember how happy you were, when i...

- que:
  - when you what?
  ans:
  - when i taught your children about the doctrine of stoicism and they finally understood it.

- que:
  - have you got that?
  ans:
  - but as the porcelain pulverized on the floor it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating.

- que:
  - from whom?
  ans:
  - from dad.

- que:
  - absolutely.
  ans:
  - grace, where've you been?

- que:
  - i shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should i?
  ans:
  - it's nothing to be ashamed of.

- que:
  - at twelve o'clock?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - afraid you are gonna loose them?
  ans:
  - grace, ben's hauling apples today so we won't be loading glasses.

- que:
  - where have you been?
  ans:
  - harvest is the holiest time of the year.

- que:
  - does it not sound like something you could have said?
  ans:
  - i'il be down in a minute, chuck.

- que:
  - is something wrong?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do you mind moving?
  ans:
  - try moving.

- que:
  - may i go now?
  ans:
  - i have to figure out how i'm going to get into my house.

- que:
  - or is that part of the punishment, having to sleep outdoors?
  ans:
  - no, no no grace.

- que:
  - you did what?
  ans:
  - first they suspected me, but then i convinced them that it was you, since you were the one using the medicine closet.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i'm here to do the thinking for you.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i mean, by showing them some trust.

- que:
  - what will i say?
  ans:
  - everything.

- que:
  - everything?
  ans:
  - yeah, the truth.

- que:
  - are you for us or against us?
  ans:
  - liz is right.

- que:
  - so how do we do it, tom?
  ans:
  - i agree, tom.

- que:
  - your plan didn't work out very well, did it?
  ans:
  - you'il think of another one.

- que:
  - wouldn't it be worth compromising, just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?
  ans:
  - everybody in this town has had your body, but me.

- que:
  - i trust you... but maybe you don't trust yourself?
  ans:
  - perhaps you've been tempted, you've been tempted to join the others and force me.

- que:
  - but why had nobody roused her?
  ans:
  - nobody had hammered furiously at her door.

- que:
  - or even killed?
  ans:
  - it was quite unlike dogville to restrain its indignation at any point.

- que:
  - perhaps things had turned out well after all?
  ans:
  - good morning, mrs. henson.

- que:
  - oh... good morning?
  ans:
  - i would have come earlier.

- que:
  - good morning miss grace?
  ans:
  - good morning...

- que:
  - how are you this morning?
  ans:
  - i overslept.

- que:
  - why didn't you come back and tell me?
  ans:
  - i did, but you were asleep.

- que:
  - i know it does, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - the people of this town they surprise me again and again.

- que:
  - guess where i got the inspiration?
  ans:
  - but i haven't come up with a name for the town yet.

- que:
  - why not just call it dogville?
  ans:
  - wouldn't work.

- que:
  - hey, do you want me to read it to you?
  ans:
  - if there is any love in it, it comes from you...

- que:
  - would you be offended, if i said no?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where had these ominous words come from?
  ans:
  - darkness was falling as grace made her way home from work that evening.

- que:
  - tom?
  ans:
  - hi, grace.

- que:
  - can i ask you something?
  ans:
  - yeah, anything.

- que:
  - you couldn't bring yourself to throw it away, could you?
  ans:
  - the number he gave you that night.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - secured by this very key.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - what's your opinion on the subject?
  ans:
  - maybe you have none.

- que:
  - who did that?
  ans:
  - billy, put your hand up, put your hand up.

- que:
  - if you don't want to kill me, then why did you come?
  ans:
  - our last conversation, the one in which you told me what it was you didn't like about me never really concluded, as you ran away.

- que:
  - that's why you showed up?
  ans:
  - and you call me stubborn.

- que:
  - you're sure you're not here to force me to go back and become like you?
  ans:
  - if i thought there was a chance of forcing you, but of course that will never happen.

- que:
  - what is it, the thing... the thing that you don't like about me?
  ans:
  - it was a word you used that provoked me.

- que:
  - that's what you came here to say?
  ans:
  - i'm not the one passing judgment, daddy.

- que:
  - a deprived childhood and a homicide really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?
  ans:
  - the only thing you can blame is circumstances.

- que:
  - so why shouldn't we forgive them?
  ans:
  - dogs can be taught many useful things, but not if we forgive them every time they obey their own nature.

- que:
  - i'm arrogant because i forgive them?
  ans:
  - my god...

- que:
  - can't you see how condescending you are when you say that?
  ans:
  - i can not think of anything more arrogant than that.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - no no no...

- que:
  - does every human being need to be accountable for their action?
  ans:
  - of course they do.

- que:
  - if you say so, grace.
  ans:
  - and without my daughter, i suppose?

- que:
  - do they love you?
  ans:
  - grace had already thought for a long time.

- que:
  - would she not, in all honesty, have done the same as chuck and vera and ben and mrs. henson and tom and all these people in their houses?
  ans:
  - grace paused.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - so that would mean that i'd also take on the immediate responsibilities at once.

- que:
  - can we just shoot him now?
  ans:
  - let me talk to him.

- que:
  - a man can't really be blamed for being scared now, can he?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - wouldn't you say?
  ans:
  - not now, tom.

- que:
  - something else, honey?
  ans:
  - there is a family with kids... do the kids first and make the mother watch.

- que:
  - do you need a wrap?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - you want the curtains opened?
  ans:
  - you don't need them anymore.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think we should open them.

- que:
  - do you think that i can allow myself to use it as an inspiration in my writing?
  ans:
  - give me him.

- que:
  - how about emanoel?
  ans:
  - wellington.

- que:
  - who owns the place?
  ans:
  - of course not, son.

- que:
  - what will we do with him?
  ans:
  - forget it, francisco.

- que:
  - school?
  ans:
  - for the children, dad.

- que:
  - but school, helena?
  ans:

- que:
  - who wants a yellow one?
  ans:
  - go on in.

  ans:
  - form a duo with your brother.

- que:
  - what about me?
  ans:
  - i'd rather have a soccer ball.

- que:
  - where the devil did he get a concertina, helena?
  ans:
  - at the store, dad.

- que:
  - i can't play yet.
  ans:
  - couldn't you give him some tips?

- que:
  - i'il only teach this once.
  ans:
  - can't play?

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - what's that, dad?
  ans:
  - here.

  - how are you?
  ans:
  - francisco camargo, the boys 'father.

- que:
  - can we hear a bit of the song before it goes on air?
  ans:
  - no instruments, just to hear your voices.

- que:
  - did you get everything?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - are the kids there?
  ans:
  - don't cry, son.

- que:
  - is it this one, dad?
  ans:
  - you're all wet.

- que:
  - can you play that, squirt?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - look, emival.

- que:
  - can't you put two and two together?
  ans:
  - you think...

- que:
  - why is it sad?
  ans:
  - he's away from all of this bad stuff that's here on earth.

- que:
  - what is so bad about that?
  ans:
  - throughout my life, i just wanted to be like an angel for god, do something where i could be of some help.

- que:
  - they should change every week.
  ans:
  - what's up, nigga?

- que:
  - how could reagan live in a white house, which has a lot of rooms, and there be homelessness?
  ans:
  - and he's talking about helping.

- que:
  - why can't he take people off the street and put them in his white house?
  ans:
  - then he'il have people from the streets to help him with his ideas.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - we need protection too.

- que:
  - are you rolling?
  ans:
  - i'm most like my mom because i'm arrogant.

- que:

  ans:
  - they gave me 42, 000.

  ans:

- que:
  - you know what they used to make here?

- que:
  - you were gonna be a painter, right?
  ans:
  - you're a funny one.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - i think it's good, but i think you could go even deeper.

- que:
  - does any of what i'm saying resonate?
  ans:
  - i suppose what i'm trying to say is you have to go as deep as you possibly can.

- que:
  - so, if art as an object is dead, why is everything so expensive?
  ans:
  - otherwise nobody would buy it.

- que:
  - herr von lieberfelt and his troupe?
  ans:

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the purity of the blood.

- que:
  - ls your father jewish?
  ans:
  - yes, he is.

- que:
  - your own hero nietzsche said anti semitism is the ideology of those who feel cheated.
  ans:
  - why not ask whether she's a german?

- que:
  - how do you know nietzsche's my hero?
  ans:
  - you've obviously skimmed his ideas.

- que:
  - are you gonna smoke another cigarette?
  ans:
  - you just put one out.

- que:
  - now where is my instinct, my secret instinct for self preservation, i ask you?
  ans:
  - i've heard these theories all my life.

- que:
  - and why are you making those appalling speeches for the army?
  ans:
  - i'm just keeping my hand in it.

- que:
  - keeping your hand in what?
  ans:
  - the army is paying my expenses.

- que:
  - can we take it one step at a time?
  ans:
  - listen, rothman, i've lost four years.

- que:
  - can you do that?
  ans:
  - cause that's what you got to do.

- que:
  - you do think i'm talented, don't you?
  ans:
  - one morning, i wish you'd just say, \"good morning.

- que:
  - your children in good health, i trust?

- que:
  - what has this got to do with modern art?
  ans:

  ans:
  - that'd be a great art project.

  ans:
  - i said yes, i know what you said.

- que:
  - so, anyway... why have i invited you to this sacred turf?
  ans:

  - they thought i was a hero, but you know something?
  ans:
  - i envied that man so much.

- que:
  - but how, tom?
  ans:
  - there is no right of appeal.

- que:

- que:

  - no.

- que:

  - what did she say?
  ans:
  - she said she'd think about it.

- que:
  - sister, why don't you cut my hair?
  ans:
  - you've cut everybody else's.

- que:
  - why should that make a difference?
  ans:
  - i don't think that i should be treated special just because my daddy's getting famous.

- que:
  - yes, and didn't he tell you to let me go home?
  ans:
  - you didn't take a blind bit of notice.

- que:
  - and who will explain it to sister theresa if she gets cross?
  ans:
  - you, sister.

- que:
  - nervous?
  ans:
  - i'm only trying to make legal history... by doing something that's never been done before, and if i fail, i'm unemployable.

- que:
  - ls this all right?
  ans:
  - it's fine.

- que:
  - ls that correct?
  ans:
  - it is.

- que:
  - yes, but the grounds for our action now are fundamentally different, is that not so?
  ans:
  - i suppose it is.

- que:
  - pardon?
  ans:
  - your job, sir.

- que:
  - who appointed you?
  ans:
  - objection, your lordship.

- que:
  - as minister for education, you are a government appointee, are you not?
  ans:
  - of course i am.

- que:
  - what is the document on which the lrish government's authority... and therefore your authority, rests?
  ans:
  - the lrish constitution.

- que:
  - have you read it recently?
  ans:
  - objection, your lordship.

- que:
  - would it be fair to say that, minister?
  ans:
  - we are waiting for your response.

- que:
  - he shouted at me, \"where is my daughter?
  ans:
  - he yelled at the top of his voice.

- que:
  - and what did you say to him, sister?
  ans:
  - i asked him if he had an appointment.

- que:
  - and what did he say?
  ans:
  - he grabbed me by the throat and almost choked the life out of me.

- que:
  - and what did he do then, sister?
  ans:
  - i told him where the girl was and he ran upstairs... repeating his threats as he did so.

- que:
  - did you report this deplorable incident to anyone?
  ans:
  - yes, i phoned the police.

- que:
  - have i messed it up for us all, then?
  ans:
  - you may have.

- que:
  - i hope that was the only such incident?
  ans:
  - of course it was.

- que:
  - haven't you heard the phrase, \"as sober as a judge\"?
  ans:
  - so, you see, your lordship...

- que:
  - wouldn't any father have done what i did?
  ans:
  - evelyn's face was all battered and bruised.

- que:
  - how can you, as a single father and as a catholic... possibly claim to bring up your children without a mother?
  ans:
  - there is absolutely no precedent for it... in the religion in which you allegedly believe.

- que:
  - mr. doyle?
  ans:
  - there is....

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - the fundamental building block of our faith is not the holy family... it's the holy trinity.

- que:
  - doesn't the holy bible say,\"... faith, hope and love... \"but the greatest of these is love\"?
  ans:
  - i've given up the drink.

- que:
  - don't you like it?
  ans:
  - it's lovely, pet.

- que:
  - lsn't that correct?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, she did.

- que:
  - and why was that?
  ans:
  - because my face was all swollen and black and blue.

- que:
  - you didn't say otherwise, did you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - let me ask you one last time... do you remember falling in the corridor and hitting your face on the stairs?
  ans:
  - no, i didn't fall on the stairs.

- que:
  - why on earth would the good sister hit you?
  ans:
  - because i said she shouldn't belt annette for getting her catechism wrong.

- que:
  - you prayed for her?
  ans:
  - yes, i did.

- que:
  - wanna hear the prayer i said last night?
  ans:
  - we do not.

- que:
  - sister, why couldn't me and the boys go to court today?
  ans:
  - because they don't want a repeat of the scenes they had last time.

- que:
  - tom, have we lost?
  ans:
  - i agree with my learned friend, justice ferris...

- que:

  - is he a nutcase?
  ans:
  - no, he's a rock biter.

- que:
  - did the lake dry up?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - a hole?
  ans:
  - a hole would be something.

- que:
  - so, it's not just in our part of fantasia?
  ans:
  - maybe, it's already everywhere.

- que:
  - what can we do?
  ans:
  - my people are sending me to the ivory tower, to the empress, for help.

- que:
  - what are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - can i carry you?
  ans:
  - don't worry.

- que:
  - is he a nutcase?
  ans:
  - it was not you we sent for.

- que:
  - if you really are the atreyu we sent for...... you would be willing to go on a quest?
  ans:
  - yes, of course.

- que:
  - what kind of a quest?
  ans:
  - to find a cure for the empress...... and to save our world.

- que:
  - any chance of success?
  ans:
  - i do not know.

- que:
  - when do i begin?
  ans:
  - now.

- que:
  - is it time to go already?
  ans:
  - i know what you want.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - come on, boy.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - i understand.

- que:
  - are you morla, the ancient one?
  ans:
  - not that it matters, but yes.

- que:
  - do you recognize this?
  ans:
  - well...... we haven't seen...... the auryn in a long time.

- que:
  - is there someone else here, too?
  ans:
  - we haven't spoken to anyone else...... for thousands of years.

- que:
  - did you know the empress is ill?
  ans:
  - not that it matters, but yes.

- que:
  - don't you care?
  ans:
  - we don't even care...... whether or not we care.

- que:
  - do you have a cold?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you know how to help the empress, don't you?
  ans:
  - not that it matters...... but yes.

- que:
  - die?
  ans:
  - that, at least, would be something.

- que:
  - how can i get there?
  ans:
  - you can't.

- que:
  - leaving so soon?
  ans:
  - i was just going to....

- que:
  - i was trying to sneak away?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - for breakfast?
  ans:
  - never.

- que:
  - how did you know that?
  ans:
  - you were unconscious.

- que:
  - could you get around...... and scratch behind my right ear?
  ans:
  - i can never quite reach it.

- que:
  - here?
  ans:
  - that's so good.

- que:
  - so, little fellow, you're on your way to the southern oracle?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you know how to get there?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - how did all this happen?
  ans:
  - with luck.

- que:
  - you brought me the entire 10, 000 miles?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - well, little man, still in pain?
  ans:
  - it's all right.

- que:
  - good?
  ans:
  - that's my bat wing broth.

- que:
  - anything of interest to the scientific community?
  ans:
  - my name is atreyu.

- que:
  - why don't you sit down and be quiet for once?
  ans:
  - you keep quiet, wench.

- que:
  - ever heard of me?
  ans:
  - i've been studying the southern oracle for years.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i work scientifically.

- que:
  - is that the southern oracle?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - the sphinxes 'eyes...... stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth...... tries to pass by.

- que:
  - the sphinxes 'eyes, are they open or shut?
  ans:
  - fancy armor doesn't help.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - that won't be too hard for him.

- que:
  - the southern oracle?
  ans:
  - do not be afraid.

- que:
  - are you the southern oracle?
  ans:
  - yes, we are.

- que:
  - the empress...... needs...... a new name.
  ans:
  - well, what is it?

- que:
  - that's all?
  ans:
  - but that's easy.

- que:
  - where can i find one?
  ans:
  - you can only find one...... beyond the boundaries of fantasia.

- que:
  - do you know where they are?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - then how do we find a human child?
  ans:
  - i always thought that's what they were.

- que:
  - if you come any closer...... l will rip you to shreds.
  ans:
  - they look...... like good...... strong...... hands, don't they?

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i am gmork.

- que:
  - what's so funny?
  ans:
  - fantasia has no boundaries.

- que:
  - don't you know anything about fantasia?
  ans:
  - it's the world of human fantasy.

- que:
  - why is fantasia dying then?
  ans:
  - because people have begun to lose their hopes...... and forget their dreams.

- que:
  - what is the nothing?
  ans:
  - it's the emptiness that's left.

- que:
  - but why?
  ans:
  - because people who have no hopes...... are easy to control.

- que:
  - who are you, really?
  ans:
  - i am the servant...... of the power behind the nothing.

- que:
  - anything at all?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - could the ivory tower still be standing?
  ans:
  - let's hope so, atreyu.

- que:
  - why do you look so sad?
  ans:
  - i have failed you, empress.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the earthling child.

- que:
  - you knew about the earthling child?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - to find out what you already knew?
  ans:
  - it was the only way to get in touch with an earthling.

- que:
  - lf he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?
  ans:
  - he doesn't realize he's already part of the neverending story.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - just as he is sharing all your adventures...... others are sharing his.

- que:
  - what if he doesn't appear?
  ans:
  - then our world will disappear.

- que:
  - how could he let that happen?
  ans:
  - he doesn't understand that he's the one with the power to stop it.

- que:
  - is it really me?
  ans:
  - maybe he doesn't know what to do.

- que:
  - what do i have to do?
  ans:
  - but i can't.

- que:
  - why is it so dark?
  ans:
  - in the beginning, it is always dark.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - one grain of sand.

- que:
  - fantasia has totally disappeared?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - open your hand.

- que:
  - what are you going to wish for?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how many wishes do i get?
  ans:
  - as many as you want.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - look, there they are.

- que:
  - it's quiet, isn't it?
  ans:
  - like the devil's laugh.

- que:
  - you had any luck?
  ans:
  - no, not very much.

- que:
  - where's kate?
  ans:

- que:
  - how did he find out about the unfortunate and her child?
  ans:
  - well, he has that kind of cleverness... you'il sometimes find in the middle classes.

- que:
  - the old fellow isn't as far gone as all that, is he?
  ans:
  - no.

  - you want to blackmail me too?
  ans:
  - stuyvesant wouldn't like that.

- que:
  - what's this murder shit?
  ans:
  - i don't know who the hell you are, but you listen, i loved scotty gates.

  - why'd he run around telling people you tortured him?
  ans:
  - because he went crazy.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - how the hell should i know, i wasn't even here.

- que:
  - does it hurt?
  ans:
  - i like you, romulus.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - well, let me rephrase.

- que:
  - if the price of rapture... is a mountain of suffering, shouldn't the fee be paid?

- que:
  - what do you think you're doing?

  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - ls there any way that i could take a few lessons?
  ans:
  - i think i might be able to write better about the physics principles if i'm the one actually applying them.

- que:
  - where are my gummi bears?
  ans:
  - i gave them to you.

- que:
  - you don't want it?
  ans:
  - i'il eat it.

- que:

- que:
  - aren't you going overboard with this project?
  ans:
  - no, i'm totally committed to it, like you're committed to skating.

- que:
  - would you shut up?
  ans:
  - i've gotta focus.

- que:
  - class, can you tell our assistant the most important rule for this class?
  ans:
  - mom...

- que:
  - what's that rule about what goes up?
  ans:
  - technically, it's that every particle attracts...

- que:
  - look, could you try not to, like, squish me?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

  ans:
  - um, i can't afford it.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - to have a life.

- que:
  - you think i have a life?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you insane?
  ans:

- que:
  - \"the jumping shrimp\"?
  ans:
  - my mom copyrighted it.

  ans:
  - um... right.

- que:
  - hi.
  ans:
  - just can't keep off the ice, can you?

- que:
  - where have you been?
  ans:

- que:
  - no, where have you been all week?
  ans:
  - this tutoring thing has got me totally stretched out.

- que:
  - ann was with you just now?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:

  ans:
  - nothing.

  - what do you have to gain by this?
  ans:
  - i'm good.

- que:
  - eight years?
  ans:
  - and then a few years touring with has beens on lce.

- que:
  - that's the end of your life?
  ans:
  - i love it, mom.

- que:
  - lsn't your mom coming?
  ans:
  - she's not really into skating.

- que:
  - guess what?
  ans:
  - slonski toyota sponsorship, it's a done deal.

- que:
  - you think?
  ans:
  - hey, watch this.

- que:
  - what was that about?
  ans:
  - well, i don't have to if you don't want me to.

- que:
  - like that's a step up?
  ans:
  - don't talk to her, nikki.

- que:
  - how'd she know about that?
  ans:
  - she's got eyes in the back of her horns.

- que:
  - next year?
  ans:
  - no way are you gonna place this year.

- que:
  - it's the old, \"you've already lost so why bother trying?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - haven't you heard of eyeliner?
  ans:
  - she came to win.

- que:
  - how do they feel?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - you can't compete on new skates.

- que:
  - you mean tina, whose robot daughter almost didn't make sectionals because of you?
  ans:
  - typical tina harwood.

- que:
  - you don't know anything, do you?
  ans:
  - they kicked her out.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, casey, but your old skates were a mess.

- que:
  - you bought her new skates?
  ans:
  - you're just as bad as she is.

- que:
  - how could you think that?
  ans:
  - because it's true.

- que:
  - what kind of people are you?
  ans:
  - come on, let's go.

- que:
  - can you come and get me?
  ans:
  - i'm at the skating rink at westerly.

- que:
  - how dare you?
  ans:
  - just hang on, kids.

- que:
  - filling her head with a fantasy that she can skate and sabotaging her chances?
  ans:
  - i did you a favor.

- que:
  - ls she gifted?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm aware.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - and i'm done.

- que:
  - done?
  ans:
  - i'm quitting.

- que:
  - do you know what i want?
  ans:
  - no, you don't know what i want.

- que:
  - overdone it?
  ans:
  - just a little.

- que:
  - you heard the whole thing?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - it's your slot, casey.

- que:
  - you sure about that?
  ans:
  - it's a nice little experiment.

- que:
  - how does a triple loop jump entitle you to a physics scholarship?
  ans:
  - the proof of the experiment isn't in the mumbo jumbo of the calculations.

- que:
  - so, casey, why are you passionate about harvard?
  ans:
  - dr. healey, my mom and i have been imagining harvard practically my whole life.

- que:
  - how did you know?
  ans:
  - didn't think you'd give up.

- que:
  - i can't have a conversation with anybody i haven't known since kindergarten, so how come i can do that in front of you?
  ans:
  - because you let people see you when you skate.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - five minutes.

- que:
  - why didn't you win?
  ans:
  - i had an unfortunate warm up before my short program.

- que:
  - are you sorry?
  ans:
  - look, i paid my dues.

- que:
  - why on earth would i do that?
  ans:
  - because you don't have a skater and i don't have a coach.

- que:
  - and the make up and shirt?
  ans:
  - i did not buy you that shirt.

- que:
  - you think this is about glamour?
  ans:
  - it is a sport, mom.

- que:
  - why are you jealous of her?
  ans:
  - well, i guess no matter how old we get, the rest of us will still always hate the prom queen.

- que:
  - do l?
  ans:
  - but if you could just come to the rink and see me.

- que:
  - you know what, i have a class, all right?
  ans:
  - welcome to espn at the eastern sectional junior ladies 'short program.

- que:
  - so, are you a science geek too?
  ans:
  - math geek.

- que:
  - do you know any cute guys?
  ans:
  - at least i landed the jumps.

- que:
  - hey, did you work things out with your mum?
  ans:
  - um, we've hardly spoken in two months.

- que:
  - don't you mean shirley jackson?
  ans:
  - you've done your reading.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - believe me, you don't wanna know.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - skate with your heart.

- que:
  - tomorrow.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - nikki and zoey first and second in the ordinals, degroat third.
  ans:
  - who said you could let go?

- que:
  - those are almost even with nikki's.
  ans:
  - will that fall cost her, or will that rally, not to mention the added technical difficulty push her past the others?

- que:
  - did she do it?
  ans:
  - no, it's not enough.

- que:
  - mom?
  ans:
  - lf i'd known.

- que:
  - how could i not see?
  ans:
  - you see me better than anybody.

- que:
  - nikki.
  ans:
  - don't you know what'il happen after six months with tina?

- que:
  - can we have a word?
  ans:
  - hello, peter.

- que:
  - burger blast?
  ans:
  - oh no, i am sorry.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - lf she can't eat it, she can't endorse it.

- que:
  - what about cod liver oil?
  ans:
  - guys.

- que:
  - are you out of your mind, with everything she's doing?
  ans:
  - all right, two.

- que:
  - you got all the paperwork?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you pissed off at me?
  ans:
  - i'm just doing my part.

  ans:
  - yeah, that's big tom.

  - how's it goin 'there, big tom?
  ans:
  - hey, hey.

- que:

  ans:
  - because i'il call.

- que:
  - when you find him, bring him and the gun back stateside, got it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - itdoesn'tmake a difference, honey.

- que:
  - whydoyou haveto correctme?
  ans:
  - it's nobleman.

- que:
  - why do you have to park so far away?
  ans:
  - this ridge was a little further away than it looked.

- que:
  - rodney, do you even know what it is we are looking for?
  ans:
  - yeah, well, whatever it is, it's around here somewhere.

- que:
  - what's around here?
  ans:
  - whatever it was that was causing the energy spike we detected from the puddle jumper.

- que:
  - d'you have any idea what that looks like?
  ans:
  - i'il know it when i see it...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - some kind of an energy barrier around the threshold.

- que:
  - you got tape?
  ans:
  - because...

- que:
  - welcome 'and 'ascension '.
  ans:
  - are we done?

- que:
  - ascension?
  ans:
  - to a higher plane of existence.

- que:
  - any volunteers?
  ans:
  - i'il go.

- que:
  - problematic?
  ans:
  - yeah, like poisonous atmosphere, acid atmosphere, no atmosphere.

- que:
  - why did you tell us to let him go?
  ans:
  - because you weren't gonna stop and the last thing we need is both of you to get pulled in with him.

- que:
  - why would the ancestors create something that would do this?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - this is sheppard, can you hear me now?
  ans:
  - that is the one thing i am not doing.

- que:
  - what are you doin ', mckay?
  ans:
  - i am trying to determine how much faster time is passing on the other side of the portal than it is here.

- que:
  - why would time progress faster?
  ans:
  - the cave opens up to the other side of the ridge but there's nothing in the immediate area i can survive on.

- que:
  - how about sending me a signal to show me that you're still there?
  ans:
  - doesn't have to be a rock, you can write a damn note.

- que:
  - look, hours equate to days, and days for us could mean years for him.
  ans:
  - why?

- que:
  - and you, stay here.
  ans:
  - do you get it now?

- que:
  - and do what?
  ans:
  - don't go through, if that's what you're thinking.

- que:
  - come in?
  ans:
  - you guys are starting to worry me a little bit here.

- que:
  - what the hell took you guys so long?
  ans:
  - alright.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - extra batteries for the camcorder.

- que:
  - you know what to do?
  ans:
  - the excruciating pain he was experiencing was a result of the temporal differential.

- que:
  - who knows what that could do to him?
  ans:
  - i have no idea, but i suspect he could use a doctor.

- que:
  - so you don't even know if he's alive?
  ans:
  - the most time efficient approach was to assume that he was alive but stranded.

- que:
  - this is mckay.
  ans:
  - and why not assume that he'il make his own way back through the portal?

- que:
  - supplies been loaded aboard yet?
  ans:
  - almost there, sir.

- que:
  - to see if sheppard's still alive?
  ans:
  - and to determine the true passage of time on the other side.

- que:
  - what're we not thinking of?
  ans:
  - now take a minute, and be certain.

- que:
  - his lifetime?
  ans:
  - if it takes us a week to ten days to fix this, then it won't matter, because he will probably have died of old age.

- que:
  - now, you ready?
  ans:
  - it's there.

- que:
  - alright, is there a safe place for us to go?
  ans:
  - no, no, the cloister is too far.

- que:
  - the jumper sensors aren't picking up anything?
  ans:
  - nothing, ma'am.

- que:
  - what is this probe of yours supposed to do?
  ans:
  - well, it's supposed to descend slowly into the atmosphere of a gas giant.

- que:
  - have we met?
  ans:
  - when avrid first brought you here.

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - you're a little young to be a doctor.

- que:
  - didn't it come after you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you hungry?
  ans:
  - starving.

- que:
  - which one of you got me out of my clothes and into these?
  ans:
  - i did.

- que:
  - is that alright?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what do we have here?
  ans:
  - i'm glad you're feeling better.

- que:
  - avrid, i'm happy to visit and i'm grateful for the food and the whole healing thing, but... do you know the way out of here?
  ans:
  - there is no way to leave, john, other than to ascend.

- que:
  - what exactly do you mean by \"there's no way\"?
  ans:
  - that is the sole purpose of this place...

- que:
  - then why did you enter the portal?
  ans:
  - exactly what i was afraid would happen.

- que:
  - did you receive any telemetry before the probe failed?
  ans:
  - actually quite a lot.

- que:
  - is it so terrible here?
  ans:
  - no, you folks have been great.

- que:
  - why'd you come here?
  ans:
  - well, i was born here.

- que:
  - so what's holdin 'you back?
  ans:
  - journeys such as ours can take a lifetime.

- que:
  - you afraid it might not happen?
  ans:
  - we're not afraid of anything.

- que:
  - and what kind of life is that?
  ans:
  - well, life here is not entirely without its pleasures.

- que:
  - what good is that?
  ans:
  - once we know where the generator is, one way or another, i should be able to turn it off.

- que:
  - then shouldn't he be the one bringing me breakfast?
  ans:
  - he is meditating with the others.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i've never seen such bravery.

- que:
  - what the hell's the matter with you people?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - you sure it was three seconds?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - just out of curiosity, what does that mean for colonel sheppard in terms of... days?
  ans:
  - we're already talking months.

- que:
  - is that some special power of yours you haven't told me about?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - i've been able to close my eyes and see your face my entire life, john.

- que:
  - the one what?
  ans:
  - the one who will lead us to ascension.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - nothin '.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - tonight.

- que:
  - tonight?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - and what's the warning?
  ans:
  - that once you cross the threshold, there's no return.

- que:
  - you were just...
  ans:
  - rodney?

- que:
  - that's weird...?
  ans:
  - well, we may as well relax.

- que:
  - haven't any of you seen thunderstorms?
  ans:
  - the sanctuary provides rain for the orchards.

- que:
  - haven't any of you got things you wanna do as flesh and blood human beings first?
  ans:
  - i mean, you, you talk about moving on to a plane of existence beyond your own mortality, but you haven't even really lived.

- que:
  - from what?
  ans:
  - you know the answer to that.

- que:
  - are, are you sure?
  ans:
  - that's the best news i've...

- que:
  - you wanna pick up the pace, mckay?
  ans:
  - i'm not detecting anything.

- que:
  - can you see anything?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - maybe we should try another way?
  ans:
  - won't make any difference.

- que:
  - yeah, more than one what?
  ans:
  - i do not know.

- que:
  - what the hell took you so long?
  ans:
  - believe it or not, you were only gone a couple of hours.

- que:
  - what was that bloody thing?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - can we talk about this somewhere else?
  ans:
  - no, it is still close.

- que:
  - you've fought this thing before?
  ans:
  - twice.

- que:
  - how did you beat it?
  ans:
  - still haven't figured that out.

- que:
  - friends of yours?
  ans:
  - we've come to stand with you, whatever happens.

- que:
  - that's all it took?
  ans:
  - you were right, john.

- que:
  - one day, perhaps?
  ans:
  - yeah, one day.

- que:
  - what?

  - manufacturer's latest gynoids go berserk, attacking their owners, company panics and recalls every one.

- que:
  - so, where do we start?

  - no thanks, we'il skip the tour.

- que:
  - isn't that right?
  ans:
  - \"commit suicide \"meaning...

- que:
  - miss haraway, how exactly would a robot kill itself?
  ans:
  - by intentionally malfunctioning, these gynoids are capable of self authorizing attacks against humans.

- que:
  - isn't \"self destruction \"more accurate?
  ans:
  - if you assume differences between humans and machines are obvious.

- que:
  - are such \"suicides \"confined to a particular model?
  ans:
  - not necessarily.

- que:
  - the cause?
  ans:
  - e brain contamination from microbes and viruses, human production errors, functional defects from wear and tear.

- que:
  - but?
  ans:
  - i say it's because humans discard robots once they're redundant.

- que:
  - do you have children?
  ans:
  - a daughter.

- que:
  - then what are children who endure in the chaos preceding maturity?
  ans:
  - they differ profoundly from \"humans, \"but they obviously have human form.

- que:
  - what on earth are you talking about?
  ans:
  - raising children is the simplest way to achieve the ancient dream of artificial life.

- que:
  - can we get back to reality here?
  ans:
  - i'd like your observations with respect to the hadaly robot, model 2052, manufactured by locus solus.

- que:
  - particular functions?
  ans:
  - it's equipped with organs unnecessary in service robots.

- que:
  - meaning?
  ans:
  - it's a sexaroid.

- que:
  - but, what?
  ans:
  - we found a file in the audio buffer.

- que:
  - care to hear it?
  ans:
  - help me.

- que:

- que:
  - the chief showing up at a scene?
  ans:
  - the corpse is missing parts, that's why.

  ans:
  - the boss has taken an interest.

- que:
  - fresh dog food, huh?
  ans:
  - stick to dry food and he'il last longer.

- que:
  - you're teamed up with togusa?
  ans:
  - beats being paired off with a rookie fresh out of training.

- que:
  - what now?
  ans:
  - stick to the dry food.

- que:
  - someone took their time dismembering the corpse?
  ans:
  - so it appears.

- que:
  - why'd the perp bother with the organs?
  ans:
  - maybe to create the impression he was a psycho or a freak.

- que:
  - what's with the warped doorknob?
  ans:
  - analysis indicates a chinese prosthetic limb, model nr26.

- que:
  - did you track down the license on those yakuza wheels?
  ans:
  - they've covered their tracks with a lot of illegal modifications.

- que:
  - but where's the motive?
  ans:
  - the kojinkai's an entrenched japanese crime syndicate.

- que:
  - if volkerson knew they had it in for him, why'd he take the trouble of hiding out on their turf?
  ans:
  - we don\"t know.

- que:
  - the terrorists masquerading as deranged robots scenario?
  ans:
  - there's no political link between the victims, so i think that's a dead end.

- que:
  - do you consider yourself to be happy?
  ans:
  - well, sure.

- que:
  - chief, why did you pick me for this job?
  ans:
  - because it was the major who plucked you off your local beat.

- que:
  - what'd he want?
  ans:
  - apparently you don't need to be caesar in order to understand him.

- que:
  - you planning on starting a war?
  ans:
  - no need to be a yakuza to pay them a visit, but we'il need weapons.

- que:
  - you dislike yakuza?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - but we're just going to chat, right?
  ans:

  ans:
  - we take turns, i'il lead.

- que:
  - even presuming they went off at their most lethal range, you think two grenades are going to off an armored cyborg?
  ans:
  - you insult me.

- que:
  - betting on that obvious a move?
  ans:
  - moron.

- que:
  - still with me, pal?

  ans:

  ans:
  - carmen, it's a passage.

- que:
  - what about him?
  ans:
  - i've been rereading my tech manual.

- que:
  - what do you suggest?
  ans:

- que:
  - what about his sister?
  ans:
  - her too.

- que:
  - what have you been doing?
  ans:
  - playing prisoner.

- que:
  - do you want to win this game or not?
  ans:
  - she's the reason this level's unwinnable.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, juni.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - yes, yes.

- que:
  - how can i go back, juni?
  ans:
  - in here, i can walk.

- que:
  - those video games are killers on the eyes, huh, kid?
  ans:
  - agent cortez, we'il take it from here.

- que:
  - cortez, are these the boys that were in the game with you?
  ans:
  - well, in the real world, i'm not that smart.

- que:
  - so who are you out here in the real world?
  ans:
  - special agent cortez, we need you.

- que:
  - what switch did you hit exactly?
  ans:
  - there were two switches side by side.

- que:
  - did you free the toymaker by accident?
  ans:

  ans:
  - it's never too late, sebastian.

- que:
  - who won?
  ans:
  - it's not whether you win or lose.

- que:
  - and you expect me to believe that mary woodhouse died out of sheer fright while you were having a seance?

- que:
  - our new mark?
  ans:
  - morgan price.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because, that's who the king wants us to fleece.

- que:
  - how much are we going after?
  ans:
  - $5 million.

- que:
  - i'm just thinking out loud here... but $5 million in a briefcase?
  ans:
  - we never had a problem with that, before.

- que:

- que:
  - i mean, are you pissed off about al?
  ans:
  - look at me.

- que:
  - to who?
  ans:
  - don't be a knucklehead.

  ans:
  - if vig is right, we're looking at 100, 150.

- que:
  - you think it's a good idea?
  ans:
  - we never done this shit before.

- que:
  - well, what is he gonna do, file a missing drug report?
  ans:
  - hey if it works out, we could turn the guy over a few times.

- que:
  - i had a cap put in here, right?
  ans:
  - write that shit in as a cavity or something.

  - let's go.

- que:
  - what the fuck you got?
  ans:

- que:
  - so, how did you get caught?
  ans:
  - tommy suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later somebody's gonna start asking the right questions.

- que:
  - am i the only one who feels like we can't make a move, with this guy on us?
  ans:
  - i think we should ditch him.

- que:
  - what the fuck is it with you and bathrooms, huh?
  ans:
  - tell me.

  ans:
  - what about customs?

- que:
  - lupus, you think the king would be willing to bank us?
  ans:
  - you already owe him.

- que:
  - what do you say you get your add under control, and we get to the fucking point?
  ans:
  - ooh, i think jake is referring to my medication, which i thought was confidential.

- que:
  - because if i don't, i become hyper, or primitive, right?
  ans:
  - or impulsive.

  - what?
  ans:
  - it's a lot of cash.

- que:
  - did you see how quickly he got out of here?
  ans:
  - he's not coming back, it's over.

- que:
  - did anybody mess up the hoop?
  ans:
  - it's clean.

- que:
  - so who cares if you have to bend the rules a little bit?
  ans:
  - as long as nobody gets hurt.

- que:
  - what about the money?
  ans:
  - then there it is again, that itch.

  ans:
  - well, lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night.

- que:
  - i mean, cash, that much, and we never had to put him on the send?

  ans:
  - it's called a facial twitch, miles.

- que:
  - whoa, whoa, whoa, you wanna give the money back?

  ans:
  - cause i'm getting a ride.

- que:

  ans:
  - and if he shoots you or stabs you or causes you to bleed profusely, call a cab, 'cause your ass ain't getting back in here.

- que:

  - sisters, huh?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - and you're over 18?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - is that because you look so innocent, and you're kind of cute there aren't you?
  ans:
  - yeah, it's something like that.

- que:
  - you just con people out of their money?
  ans:
  - there is actually some technique to it.

- que:
  - you ever been here before?
  ans:
  - my six year old nephew could con anything out of that dude.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - look, if we knew dolby was connected to you, we'd never have gone near him, so i apologize for any inconvenience.

- que:
  - honest mistake, all right?
  ans:
  - it's just something between two guys that don't know each other yet.

- que:
  - isn't that right?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - won't?
  ans:
  - you won't.

- que:
  - this is confidential, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how do you like that?
  ans:
  - they're sisters.

- que:
  - you did not know that dolby was connected to me?
  ans:
  - you heard me before.

- que:
  - you're gonna go work on your routine, you know why?
  ans:
  - because you're saying that you are sisters.

- que:
  - these are people here, they've got families, all right?
  ans:

  - why morgan price?
  ans:

  ans:
  - hard to tell with so many ids.

- que:
  - why me?
  ans:

  ans:
  - this is lupus.

- que:
  - anybody got a light?
  ans:
  - and this is lily.

- que:

  ans:
  - gordo, trust me.

- que:
  - our new mark?
  ans:
  - morgan price.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because, that's who the king wants us to fleece.

- que:
  - how much are we going after?
  ans:
  - $5 million.

- que:
  - i'm just thinking out loud here... but $5 million in a briefcase?
  ans:
  - we never had a problem with that, before.

- que:
  - yes, we have, okay?
  ans:
  - and we would have been beautiful about it.

- que:
  - i mean, are you pissed off about al?
  ans:
  - look at me.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - so if you don't want to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money.

- que:
  - gordo?
  ans:
  - yeah, jake, whatever.

- que:
  - what are we gonna do with this stuff?
  ans:
  - i mean, heroin.

- que:
  - what do you do with heroin?
  ans:
  - you sell it.

- que:
  - to who?
  ans:
  - don't be a knucklehead.

- que:
  - how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?
  ans:
  - if vig is right, we're looking at 100, 150.

- que:
  - you think it's a good idea?
  ans:
  - we never done this shit before.

- que:
  - well, what is he gonna do, file a missing drug report?
  ans:
  - hey if it works out, we could turn the guy over a few times.

- que:
  - i had a cap put in here, right?
  ans:
  - write that shit in as a cavity or something.

- que:
  - did he?
  ans:

  ans:
  - let's go.

- que:
  - what the fuck you got?
  ans:
  - get on the ground.

- que:
  - so, how did you get caught?
  ans:
  - tommy suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later somebody's gonna start asking the right questions.

- que:
  - am i the only one who feels like we can't make a move, with this guy on us?
  ans:
  - i think we should ditch him.

- que:
  - what the fuck is it with you and bathrooms, huh?
  ans:
  - tell me.

- que:

- que:
  - we're gonna need some start up cash, first.
  ans:
  - what about customs?

- que:
  - lupus, you think the king would be willing to bank us?
  ans:
  - you already owe him.

- que:
  - gordo, do we need a banker?
  ans:
  - let's do it.

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:

- que:
  - what do you say you get your add under control, and we get to the fucking point?
  ans:
  - ooh, i think jake is referring to my medication, which i thought was confidential.
