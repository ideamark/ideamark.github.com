- que:
  - You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.

- que:
  - There.
  ans:
  - How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?

- que:
  - You're sweet.
  ans:
  - Where?

- que:
  - How do you get your hair to look like that?
  ans:
  - Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.

- que:
  - So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
  ans:
  - Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.

- que:
  - I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be \"occupied\".
  ans:
  - Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?

- que:
  - You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
  ans:
  - Well, no...

- que:
  - What crap?
  ans:
  - Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.

- que:
  - What good stuff?
  ans:
  - The \"real you\".

- que:
  - Let's go.
  ans:
  - Like my fear of wearing pastels?

- que:
  - She okay?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is he oily or dry?
  ans:
  - Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...

- que:
  - Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
  ans:
  - All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.

- que:
  - You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
  ans:
  - Hopefully.

- que:
  - Queen Harry?
  ans:
  - Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.

- que:
  - Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
  ans:
  - It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.

- que:
  - What's normal?
  ans:
  - Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.

- que:
  - Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
  ans:
  - At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.

- que:
  - It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.

- que:
  - I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
  ans:
  - Can we go now?

- que:
  - He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
  ans:
  - Joey never told you we went out, did he?

- que:
  - You did what?
  ans:
  - I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.

- que:
  - I guess I'll never know, will I?
  ans:
  - It's just you.

- que:
  - Perm?
  ans:
  - Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...

- que:
  - What if she never starts dating?
  ans:
  - If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.

- que:
  - Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
  ans:
  - Otherwise known as an orgy?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He's not a \"hot rod\". Whatever that is.

- que:
  - Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
  ans:
  - Just sent 'em through.

- que:
  - You the new guy?
  ans:
  - So they tell me...

- que:
  - I was kidding. People actually live there?
  ans:
  - Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.

- que:
  - How many people were in your old school?
  ans:
  - I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.

- que:
  - Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
  ans:
  - Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.

- que:
  - You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
  ans:
  - You could consecrate with her, my friend.

- que:
  - That's her? Bianca's sister?
  ans:
  - The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

- que:
  - No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
  ans:
  - Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?

- que:
  - They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
  ans:
  - I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.

- que:
  - Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
  ans:
  - Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?

- que:
  - You got him involved?
  ans:
  - This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.

- que:
  - Will Bogey get bent?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.

- que:
  - The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
  ans:
  - Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.

- que:
  - What've you got for me?
  ans:
  - I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.

- que:
  - What'd you do to her?
  ans:
  - I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.

- que:
  - You makin' any headway?
  ans:
  - She kissed me.

- que:
  - What's the worst?
  ans:
  - You get the girl.

- que:
  - The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
  ans:
  - Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.

- que:
  - Where ya goin?
  ans:
  - Away.

- que:
  - Your sister here?
  ans:
  - Leave my sister alone.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.

- que:
  - You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
  ans:
  - I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - A hundred bucks a date.

- que:
  - Hey.
  ans:
  - How'd you do it?

- que:
  - We're not.
  ans:
  - Are you lost?

- que:
  - Does this conversation have a purpose?
  ans:
  - What? We took bathes together when we were kids.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - An attempted slit.

- que:
  - You think this'll work?
  ans:
  - No fear.

- que:
  - Who cares?
  ans:
  - You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.

- que:
  - You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
  ans:
  - I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

- que:
  - Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - William - he asked me to meet him here.

- que:
  - Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
  ans:
  - There's a way to get a guy's attention.

- que:
  - You hate me don't you?
  ans:
  - I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.

- que:
  - And why would I do that?
  ans:
  - Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...

- que:
  - Are you following me?
  ans:
  - Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

- que:
  - hey. Great show, huh?
  ans:
  - Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.

- que:
  - \"I'm getting trashed, man.\" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
  ans:
  - I say, do what you wanna do.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just let me sit down.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Dorsey.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - And I'm in control of it.

- que:
  - Were you in jail?
  ans:
  - I should do this.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - This.

- que:
  - You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
  ans:
  - Start a band?

- que:
  - So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
  ans:
  - He just wants me to be someone I'm not.

- que:
  - Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
  ans:
  - Who?

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Wholesome.

- que:
  - So what did I have an effect on ?
  ans:
  - Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.

- que:
  - You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - The Partridge Family?
  ans:
  - I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.

- que:
  - So what's your excuse?
  ans:
  - Acting the way we do.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - You never disappointed me.

- que:
  - State trooper?
  ans:
  - Fallacy.

- que:
  - The duck?
  ans:
  - Hearsay.

- que:
  - No.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.

- que:
  - So I have to have a motive to be with you?
  ans:
  - You tell me.

- que:
  - Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
  ans:
  - You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?

- que:
  - My grandmother's .
  ans:
  - How'd you get a tux at the last minute?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Wait I...

- que:
  - Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
  ans:
  - I didn't care about the money.

- que:
  - A Fender Strat. You bought this?
  ans:
  - I thought you could use it. When you start your band.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.

- que:
  - Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
  ans:
  - Because I like to torture you.

- que:
  - Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
  ans:
  - Don ' t you even dare...

- que:
  - Then tell them I had a seizure.
  ans:
  - This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?

- que:
  - Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
  ans:
  - I thought you were punishing me.

- que:
  - Why can't we agree on this?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.

- que:
  - I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
  ans:
  - No, Daddy.

- que:
  - So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
  ans:
  - Parts of it.

- que:
  - Which parts?
  ans:
  - The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.

- que:
  - What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
  ans:
  - No -- impressed.

- que:
  - When I go?
  ans:
  - Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.

- que:
  - Tempestuous?
  ans:
  - No ... I believe \"heinous bitch\" is the term used most often.

- que:
  - Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
  ans:
  - Just smack her now.

- que:
  - Hey there. Tired of breathing?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - Cool pictures. You a fan?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I guess.

- que:
  - You think?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Macbeth, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Kat a fan, too?
  ans:
  - Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.

- que:
  - What plan?
  ans:
  - The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.

- que:
  - What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
  ans:
  - I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.

- que:
  - So Dorsey can get the girl?
  ans:
  - Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.

- que:
  - You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
  ans:
  - We're your guys.

- que:
  - Are you telling me I'm a - \"non-smoker\"?
  ans:
  - Just for now.

- que:
  - Ever been to Club Skunk?
  ans:
  - No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.

- que:
  - I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
  ans:
  - Touch of the flu.

- que:
  - You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
  ans:
  - Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...

- que:
  - What's a synonym for throbbing?
  ans:
  - Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.

- que:
  - You're not helping.
  ans:
  - Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?

- que:
  - Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
  ans:
  - Your daughters went to the prom.

- que:
  - Did I have anything to say about it?
  ans:
  - Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.

- que:
  - With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
  ans:
  - He's the devil's child...

- que:
  - You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
  ans:
  - Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.

- que:
  - If they agree to follow me, yes.
  ans:
  - I am, Your Eminence

- que:
  - Is that all that interests you? Gold?
  ans:
  - No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.

- que:
  - Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
  ans:
  - If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?

- que:
  - He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
  ans:
  - It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.

- que:
  - Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
  ans:
  - Are we going to argue?

- que:
  - Can't you stay with us a little?
  ans:
  - I am busy inside.

- que:
  - I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
  ans:
  - Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.

- que:
  - May I ask by whom?
  ans:
  - Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

- que:
  - Appointment to what?
  ans:
  - Viceroy of the West Indies.

- que:
  - How far from here?
  ans:
  - I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.

- que:
  - How are you feeling, Fernando?
  ans:
  - Not bad.

- que:
  - What are you listening to?
  ans:
  - I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.

- que:
  - What does he say?
  ans:
  - He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.

- que:
  - Then you are too ambitious.
  ans:
  - No?

- que:
  - And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
  ans:
  - If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.

- que:
  - Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold?
  ans:
  - You defend yourself admirably...

- que:
  - ... for a commoner?
  ans:
  - But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.

- que:
  - What...? Do I have so many already?
  ans:
  - To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way.

- que:
  - What do you see?
  ans:
  - Island. Far.

- que:
  - Chief says -- how many?
  ans:
  - Thousands.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To bring the word of God.

- que:
  - We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
  ans:
  - He understands.

- que:
  - How did you manage it?
  ans:
  - With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.

- que:
  - Why do you wish to sail west?
  ans:
  - To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...

- que:
  - How can you be so certain?
  ans:
  - The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...

- que:
  - Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
  ans:
  - If God intends you to go, then you will go.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.

- que:
  - No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
  ans:
  - Oh? So you are a new man?

- que:
  - What did they say about Granada before today?
  ans:
  - That she was impregnable.

- que:
  - I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... \"What if?\"...
  ans:
  - May I speak freely?

- que:
  - Do they have such thoughts?
  ans:
  - They come and go as naked as the day God created them...

- que:
  - There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
  ans:
  - Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.

- que:
  - You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
  ans:
  - We don't need to know.

- que:
  - And what do you think Mendez?
  ans:
  - Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.

- que:
  - What do you read?
  ans:
  - Twenty eight.

- que:
  - What's he doing?
  ans:
  - He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.

- que:
  - Where can I meet this man?
  ans:
  - You bloody...

- que:
  - Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
  ans:
  - Yes, Your Majesty.

- que:
  - Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
  ans:
  - He must be replaced.

- que:
  - And who would you think of, for such a task?
  ans:
  - I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.

- que:
  - Then why?
  ans:
  - Because he is not afraid of me.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - I'm coming with you.

- que:
  - You bring the cigarettes?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure.

- que:
  - What about Oleg?
  ans:
  - Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.

- que:
  - What about my movie rights? Book rights?
  ans:
  - Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.

- que:
  - What's your cut? How much?
  ans:
  - I would say...half. Half is fair.

- que:
  - What else do you need?
  ans:
  - I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.

- que:
  - Your mother was blind?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.

- que:
  - Back in the Czech Republic?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...

- que:
  - Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
  ans:
  - That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.

- que:
  - Your father put cigarettes out on you?
  ans:
  - Out on my back when I was a small boy.

- que:
  - I'm abused. Don't you think?
  ans:
  - I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.

- que:
  - Now I become custody of police department?
  ans:
  - If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.

- que:
  - Are you married?
  ans:
  - Divorced.

- que:
  - Somewhere else?
  ans:
  - The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.

- que:
  - So...the station is empty?
  ans:
  - Yeah. This way.

- que:
  - You considered becoming a prostitute?
  ans:
  - Yes, I considered it.

- que:
  - Did you ever turn tricks before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about back home?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you asking me?
  ans:
  - I'm just trying to find out who you are.

- que:
  - You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
  ans:
  - They're not gonna send you right back.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

- que:
  - Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
  ans:
  - If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

- que:
  - Do you have coffee?
  ans:
  - In the kitchen.

- que:
  - Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
  ans:
  - What are you doing?

- que:
  - ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
  ans:
  - I don't want to drag you down with me.

- que:
  - C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
  ans:
  - Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.

- que:
  - Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
  ans:
  - I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.

- que:
  - Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
  ans:
  - You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

- que:
  - Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
  ans:
  - Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.

- que:
  - I let her take a shower.
  ans:
  - Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

- que:
  - A shower!? Did you take one, too?
  ans:
  - Okay. But not water sports.

- que:
  - But Chief? Over this?
  ans:
  - There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.

- que:
  - What was that, Korfin?
  ans:
  - I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.

- que:
  - Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He finished awhile ago.

- que:
  - Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
  ans:
  - It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow. At lunch.

- que:
  - What's he looking for?
  ans:
  - A timer.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Takin' a bath.

- que:
  - Any I.D.?
  ans:
  - Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.

- que:
  - Only one guys checked in?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you hit?
  ans:
  - No. I'm okay.

- que:
  - Who's there?
  ans:
  - Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.

- que:
  - Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you tell him you did?
  ans:
  - Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.

- que:
  - Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
  ans:
  - It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.

- que:
  - Watch the news?
  ans:
  - Nah, I musta missed it.

- que:
  - Nah, why should you?
  ans:
  - I don't even watch TV.

- que:
  - If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
  ans:
  - The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.

- que:
  - Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
  ans:
  - I'll come with you.

- que:
  - You're Polish?
  ans:
  - My folks are.

- que:
  - Mind if I ride along with you?
  ans:
  - This has nothing to do with your fire.

- que:
  - You thirsty?
  ans:
  - I'm on duty.

- que:
  - Something back home?
  ans:
  - She's fucked. Even if that story is true.

- que:
  - You wanna talk to her alone?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What would your girlfriend think of that?
  ans:
  - I don't have a girlfriend.

- que:
  - You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm saying here.

- que:
  - Just a shower?
  ans:
  - Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

- que:
  - Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
  ans:
  - You know, I don't know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.

- que:
  - Detective, does it look like a murder?
  ans:
  - We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.

- que:
  - How many victims are up there?
  ans:
  - There are two bodies found at this point.

- que:
  - Can we go up to the crime scene?
  ans:
  - You know you can't do that. C'mon.

- que:
  - Is it drug related?
  ans:
  - We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.

- que:
  - Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
  ans:
  - I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.

- que:
  - I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
  ans:
  - I really can't give out any information right now at this point.

- que:
  - Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
  ans:
  - He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.

- que:
  - Do you have the suspect in custody?
  ans:
  - Alright, cut, cut, cut.

- que:
  - Eddie, are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Now's not a good time.

- que:
  - Alright?
  ans:
  - Alright.

- que:
  - Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
  ans:
  - Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.

- que:
  - Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
  ans:
  - You're ruthless.

- que:
  - Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
  ans:
  - Could be Leon's.

- que:
  - Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.

- que:
  - I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.
  ans:
  - Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought. Can you call back?

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.

- que:
  - You promise?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I promise.

- que:
  - So what's unique?
  ans:
  - Not what. Who.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Keep them out of my way.

- que:
  - Okay. You ready?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

- que:
  - Any chance we can do that again?
  ans:
  - Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.

- que:
  - Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?
  ans:
  - I am butcher.

- que:
  - You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
  ans:
  - You stuff sausage in it.

- que:
  - And what do you do with the bones?
  ans:
  - Dog food.

- que:
  - No. Are you proposing?
  ans:
  - Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.

- que:
  - Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
  ans:
  - My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.

- que:
  - Where's your partner?
  ans:
  - The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.

- que:
  - Where's Czech girl?
  ans:
  - Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.

- que:
  - I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
  ans:
  - Two weeks holiday.

- que:
  - How much money are you carrying with you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - No, you're travelling together. I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at your documents? Are you related?
  ans:
  - We are both from Prague.

- que:
  - How long are you planning to stay?
  ans:
  - Two weeks.

- que:
  - I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
  ans:
  - He doesn't speak English.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - New York's finest. This is his case.

- que:
  - Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
  ans:
  - In here, says he wants a million.

- que:
  - Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
  ans:
  - Yes. Both.

- que:
  - Did you hear what I said?
  ans:
  - I want to document my trip to America.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Put the camera down, Oleg.

- que:
  - In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
  ans:
  - The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.

- que:
  - Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
  ans:
  - Your idea? I thought it was my idea.

- que:
  - Credit?
  ans:
  - Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

- que:
  - Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
  ans:
  - You got that?

- que:
  - I can get you a job.
  ans:
  - Did you hurt her?

- que:
  - A job?
  ans:
  - Yes, the money is good.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.

- que:
  - I know.
  ans:
  - In love? With who?

- que:
  - What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
  ans:
  - Well, he...

- que:
  - Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
  ans:
  - I speak English.

- que:
  - Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
  ans:
  - New York.

- que:
  - Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
  ans:
  - A cheap hotel.

- que:
  - What are you coming here to do?
  ans:
  - I'm here for movies.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - No. Go ahead.

- que:
  - So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
  ans:
  - That's what it looks like to me.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Evidence. Of a homicide.

- que:
  - Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
  ans:
  - Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.

- que:
  - How did you start the fire this time?
  ans:
  - I used an accelerant.

- que:
  - Yeah? What kind?
  ans:
  - Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, why?
  ans:
  - Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!

- que:
  - The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
  ans:
  - Clean?

- que:
  - But you knew that, right?
  ans:
  - You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.

- que:
  - Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Maybe you can be his stand-in.

- que:
  - You hear that question, Garcia?
  ans:
  - You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.

- que:
  - Aren't you tired?
  ans:
  - If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.

- que:
  - How was it?
  ans:
  - Not good.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.

- que:
  - Your doctor?
  ans:
  - Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.

- que:
  - ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
  ans:
  - You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

- que:
  - And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
  ans:
  - We're in negotiations, that's correct.

- que:
  - But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
  ans:
  - That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal. I'm not a criminal! I wasn't convicted.

- que:
  - Sure, what is it?
  ans:
  - Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - It's about my salary cheques.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.

- que:
  - Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
  ans:
  - I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.

- que:
  - But not completely inconceivable?
  ans:
  - I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

- que:
  - Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
  ans:
  - Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.

- que:
  - Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
  ans:
  - Two more.

- que:
  - Hal?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is it, Hal?
  ans:
  - MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.

- que:
  - You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
  ans:
  - Yes, I know.

- que:
  - Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
  ans:
  - Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.

- que:
  - Is your confidence in me fully restored?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is, Hal.

- que:
  - Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
  ans:
  - I'm having a party tomorrow.

- que:
  - Are you coming to my party?
  ans:
  - No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.

- que:
  - When are you coming home?
  ans:
  - In three days, darling, I hope.

- que:
  - One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
  ans:
  - Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.

- que:
  - Where is Mrs. Brown?
  ans:
  - She's in the bathroom.

- que:
  - How many days until you come home?
  ans:
  - Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.

- que:
  - I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
  ans:
  - Yes, Daddy.

- que:
  - Well, how's it going back there?
  ans:
  - Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.

- que:
  - And your charming little daughter?
  ans:
  - Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.

- que:
  - How is gregor?
  ans:
  - He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.

- que:
  - Well, where are all of you off to?
  ans:
  - Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.

- que:
  - Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
  ans:
  - No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.

- que:
  - How do you do, Mr. Miller?
  ans:
  - Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.

- que:
  - Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
  ans:
  - Yes, very pleasant.

- que:
  - Well, shall we go through Documentation?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Are you quite sure?
  ans:
  - Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.

- que:
  - You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
  ans:
  - Certainly.

- que:
  - Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
  ans:
  - Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.

- que:
  - How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
  ans:
  - By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.

- que:
  - But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
  ans:
  - Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.

- que:
  - I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
  ans:
  - Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.

- que:
  - We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
  ans:
  - I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.

- que:
  - Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
  ans:
  - No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.

- que:
  - Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
  ans:
  - True.

- que:
  - Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
  ans:
  - That's true.

- que:
  - That's true
  ans:
  - That's true.

- que:
  - Yes, Hal, what's up?
  ans:
  - It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.

- que:
  - Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
  ans:
  - Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I want to pick up my car.

- que:
  - Name?
  ans:
  - Hammond.

- que:
  - How about chargin' the battery?
  ans:
  - That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.

- que:
  - Now how's your memory doin'?
  ans:
  - Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.

- que:
  - Whaddya mean, buy?
  ans:
  - Pros.

- que:
  - Pay money?
  ans:
  - Yeah, dummy. Money.

- que:
  - Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
  ans:
  - Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.

- que:
  - Hey, what about me?
  ans:
  - And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.

- que:
  - Hey, what kind of talk is that?
  ans:
  - Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

- que:
  - Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
  ans:
  - Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

- que:
  - You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
  ans:
  - No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...

- que:
  - What's the matter with my place?
  ans:
  - No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...

- que:
  - Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
  ans:
  - Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go. I got this cop waitin' for me...

- que:
  - I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
  ans:
  - Now you're talkin'. See ya...

- que:
  - How about it?
  ans:
  - I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is. I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will. He owes me money...

- que:
  - Where's ganz?
  ans:
  - In the back. Down the other corridor.

- que:
  - Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
  ans:
  - Sure, anything you want.

- que:
  - You here to write my life story?
  ans:
  - Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.

- que:
  - What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
  ans:
  - I got a lot to protect.

- que:
  - This prison gives out $400 suits?
  ans:
  - What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.

- que:
  - Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.

- que:
  - What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
  ans:
  - I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

- que:
  - Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
  ans:
  - Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.

- que:
  - I'm helpin' you, huh?
  ans:
  - Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think you better put him on ice, man.

- que:
  - If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
  ans:
  - We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.

- que:
  - Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
  ans:
  - Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.

- que:
  - Now, where we goin', convict?
  ans:
  - Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.

- que:
  - Last night, two nights ago, three?
  ans:
  - Last night.

- que:
  - You have a good time?
  ans:
  - Sure. Then we had a fight this morning.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.

- que:
  - Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
  ans:
  - If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...

- que:
  - Hey, you wanna bet?
  ans:
  - I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.

- que:
  - What are you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it.

- que:
  - You made that move, huh?
  ans:
  - While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.

- que:
  - Yeah, right. You want to try again?
  ans:
  - Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Half a million.

- que:
  - We split 50-50?
  ans:
  - Not likely, convict.

- que:
  - You gonna let me keep any of it?
  ans:
  - Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.

- que:
  - In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
  ans:
  - Right, partner.

- que:
  - You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
  ans:
  - This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Musta got some primo bondsman.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
  ans:
  - Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
  ans:
  - I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...

- que:
  - Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
  ans:
  - If they don't tell me what I need to know...

- que:
  - Doesn't it get... Tiring?
  ans:
  - I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...

- que:
  - Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
  ans:
  - That was in style a couple years back, man.

- que:
  - Where's luther?
  ans:
  - Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.

- que:
  - What about Ganz?
  ans:
  - We missed.

- que:
  - Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
  ans:
  - Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...

- que:
  - You sure that's the reason?
  ans:
  - Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Luther's on the move...

- que:
  - Notice something funny about that bus?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It missed the last four stops.

- que:
  - Hey, how'd my car get here?
  ans:
  - I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.

- que:
  - Do I get to kiss her too?
  ans:
  - If she's right, and if you don't screw up.

- que:
  - Partnership?
  ans:
  - Well, you got to admit we come a long way.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.

- que:
  - And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
  ans:
  - That's right. Not my style, Reggie..

- que:
  - No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
  ans:
  - I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.

- que:
  - Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.

- que:
  - What the bell happened?
  ans:
  - I lost them, that's what happened.

- que:
  - How did they get away?
  ans:
  - They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.

- que:
  - Which one pulled the trigger?
  ans:
  - The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.

- que:
  - You couldn't get to him?
  ans:
  - What a screw-up.

- que:
  - Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
  ans:
  - I didn't have the time.

- que:
  - Where the Christ do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

- que:
  - The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
  ans:
  - Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.

- que:
  - Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
  ans:
  - Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.

- que:
  - Who are all these?
  ans:
  - They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
  ans:
  - Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.

- que:
  - I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them?
  ans:
  - Here's the file. Cates checks the file.

- que:
  - Nothing came in for me yet? No calls?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - I'm heading out. How about you?
  ans:
  - I got to wait for a call.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
  ans:
  - I'm not paid to take your personal calls. He was in some bar. .. off duty.

- que:
  - I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
  ans:
  - Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.

- que:
  - Who gives a fuck what you think?
  ans:
  - Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.

- que:
  - When? How?
  ans:
  - I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

- que:
  - What am I wanted for?
  ans:
  - I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...

- que:
  - This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
  ans:
  - I still don't think it's loaded.

- que:
  - What's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.

- que:
  - What'd you do?
  ans:
  - Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.

- que:
  - Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
  ans:
  - I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.

- que:
  - Hey, you know what I really think?
  ans:
  - Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

- que:
  - What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
  ans:
  - Maybe you ought to buy me one.

- que:
  - You sure you want me to?
  ans:
  - Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

- que:
  - Jack, are you okay?
  ans:
  - Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...

- que:
  - Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
  ans:
  - This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.

- que:
  - I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
  ans:
  - Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.

- que:
  - Jack? What was that?
  ans:
  - Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

- que:
  - I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
  ans:
  - We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...

- que:
  - You real down?
  ans:
  - I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...

- que:
  - What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
  ans:
  - Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.

- que:
  - Whaddya think?
  ans:
  - What do I know? I'm just a bartender.

- que:
  - How'd they take it back at headquarters?
  ans:
  - I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...

- que:
  - Who the hell are you?
  ans:
  - Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.

- que:
  - How would you know?
  ans:
  - Hey, two days with him is enough.

- que:
  - What do you want? What's goin' on?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Keep stallin'.

- que:
  - How hot are they?
  ans:
  - Hot? Hey, they're not even room temperature.

- que:
  - How ya doin'?
  ans:
  - Can't complain.

- que:
  - We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
  ans:
  - Sure, right.

- que:
  - You want that Indian to snap her neck?
  ans:
  - Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - I can't get it until Monday. Honest.

- que:
  - Rosalie, you okay?
  ans:
  - What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.

- que:
  - How you doing, man?
  ans:
  - Not bad, not bad.

- que:
  - You want to go outside?
  ans:
  - Naw, right here's okay.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.

  - Corn-i-Lius?
  ans:
  - At your service.

- que:
  - What're you laughing about?
  ans:
  - Napoleon... small.

- que:
  - I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
  ans:
  - The case..with the stones... Where is it?

- que:
  - ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
  ans:
  - Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...

- que:
  - Why? What's wrong with me?
  ans:
  - ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.

- que:
  - ...would you like a drink?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

  - Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
  ans:
  - It means, \"Never without my permission\".

- que:
  - Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
  ans:
  - We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..

- que:
  - What kind of mission?
  ans:
  - We have to save the world.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.

- que:
  - Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
  ans:
  - Leeloo's in trouble?

- que:
  - And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm saying.

- que:
  - We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
  ans:
  - One more reason to shoot first eh?

- que:
  - And then?
  ans:
  - And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.

- que:
  - Is there anything that can stop it?
  ans:
  - Yes..thank God..

- que:

- que:
  - What's the problem?
  ans:
  - I'm camera shy.

- que:
  - You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
  ans:
  - Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.

  ans:
  - He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...

- que:
  - Is that him?
  ans:
  - Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.

- que:
  - You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
  ans:
  - You betrayed us.

- que:
  - What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
  ans:
  - Call me Tom.

- que:
  - Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
  ans:
  - I figured you share information.

- que:
  - Why don't they come to me?
  ans:
  - I'm not so sure about this.

- que:
  - Any good?
  ans:
  - It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.

  - You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
  ans:
  - It's good what you're doing.

  - How'd you find me here?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - How much did he pay you?
  ans:
  - Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.

- que:
  - That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
  ans:
  - It was a lot of fucking money.

- que:
  - Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
  ans:
  - What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because we're going there.

- que:
  - You enjoy it?
  ans:
  - Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was doing for money.

- que:
  - What did you do with her body?
  ans:
  - Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.

- que:
  - Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
  ans:
  - Easy enough for you.

- que:
  - What do you want? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
  ans:
  - You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.

- que:
  - The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff?
  ans:
  - Look, you cocksucker...

- que:
  - You are a private investigator?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. How'd you find me?
  ans:
  - You're making me very angry.

- que:
  - You're asking me why?
  ans:
  - I'm asking.

- que:
  - Isn't it incredibly obvious?
  ans:
  - Enlighten me.

- que:
  - Because he could. He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for?
  ans:
  - You almost went over your limit.

- que:
  - Big date tonight?
  ans:
  - Yeah... guess so.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.

  ans:
  - You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.

- que:
  - I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
  ans:
  - A daughter.

- que:
  - So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
  ans:
  - Good question.

- que:
  - A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
  ans:
  - His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.

- que:
  - Where does he sell it?
  ans:
  - Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look. He'll also do commissions, for enough money...

- que:
  - Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
  ans:
  - I'm a working stiff, pops.

- que:
  - You want me to come out there and play private eye?
  ans:
  - Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...

- que:
  - Who is he, his name?
  ans:
  - You don't need to be here.

- que:
  - \"Devil\" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
  ans:
  - What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?

- que:
  - What's next?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.

- que:
  - Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.

- que:
  - Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Pittsburgh?
  ans:
  - He succeeded.

- que:
  - Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
  ans:
  - I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.

- que:
  - Do you want to tell me what you found?
  ans:
  - Cash, stock certificates, and this...

- que:
  - Will you watch it and see for yourself?
  ans:
  - Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.

- que:
  - Hello... ?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - Do you think the film could have cost that much?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?
  ans:
  - You told me to look, so I looked.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

- que:
  - I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
  ans:
  - I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.

- que:
  - Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
  ans:
  - I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.

- que:
  - How will I get it to you?
  ans:
  - If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.

- que:
  - Yes... ?
  ans:
  - Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...

- que:
  - I don't understand, who are... ?
  ans:
  - Yes, but...

- que:
  - Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
  ans:
  - That's exactly what I am.

- que:
  - So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What was she running from?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why do you think he did it?
  ans:
  - It got to be too much for him.

- que:
  - You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean to...

- que:
  - People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Are you religious?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There wasn't one. The police looked.

- que:
  - Do you think the police did a good job?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I think so.

- que:
  - Will you let me look?
  ans:
  - My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...

- que:
  - You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hello... ?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...

- que:
  - What are you talking about... ?
  ans:
  - She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...

- que:
  - What... ?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.

- que:
  - Who is this... ?
  ans:
  - Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...

- que:
  - Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
  ans:
  - They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry. It happened a month after she ran away. She's been dead all this time...

- que:
  - Do you know what happened to her?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to find out. She was a runaway. I'm looking into it for her parents.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Those are her belongings.

- que:
  - Her belongings?
  ans:
  - That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.

- que:
  - Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
  ans:
  - I'll do what I can.

- que:
  - None too discreet, is he?
  ans:
  - No, sir, he is not.

- que:
  - He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
  ans:
  - The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...

- que:
  - Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
  ans:
  - No, you may not.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Kincaid and Joey died last night.

- que:
  - You alright?
  ans:
  - Kristen...

- que:
  - I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
  ans:
  - It was bad.

- que:
  - Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
  ans:
  - I can't find him.

- que:
  - My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
  ans:
  - Sounds like a game show host to me.

- que:
  - Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
  ans:
  - I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.

- que:
  - How'd you learn so much about dreams?
  ans:
  - When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - When I used to have nightmares. I brought my friends in to help me. Until they all started dying.

- que:
  - Kristen, what happened?
  ans:
  - You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.

- que:
  - You in a hurry?
  ans:
  - I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.

- que:
  - Then you saw him, too?
  ans:
  - Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together. Look...

- que:
  - You're his sister, right?
  ans:
  - Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.

- que:
  - I've been working double shifts.
  ans:
  - \"In her dream\"?

- que:
  - Extra money, huh?
  ans:
  - Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.

- que:
  - How long have you been awake?
  ans:
  - Three days.

- que:
  - Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Is there something we can do?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. I guess this is my own war.

- que:
  - Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
  ans:
  - Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.

- que:
  - Then what else can we do?
  ans:
  - Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.

- que:
  - What the hell was that?
  ans:
  - Debbie. She's gone. I've...collected her, like the others.

- que:
  - So what's up? What'd I miss?
  ans:
  - She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.

- que:
  - About Freddy?
  ans:
  - What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.

- que:
  - Something the matter with the cuisine?
  ans:
  - Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.

- que:
  - What's wrong with me?
  ans:
  - Your distraught. It'll help...

- que:
  - Something wrong with the stairs?
  ans:
  - Avoid-all-contact-day.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.

- que:
  - I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
  ans:
  - What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
  ans:
  - It's lonely in there, in my room.

- que:
  - How did you know that?
  ans:
  - I could tell you were sad. I just wanted to see if you were all right.

- que:
  - Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
  ans:
  - Been having bad dreams.

- que:
  - Is that who you're waiting for?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Who says I don't like you?
  ans:
  - My friend, with the funny hand.

- que:
  - Mommy...?
  ans:
  - Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - He's inside you, where he hides.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.

- que:
  - But how...?
  ans:
  - He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.

- que:
  - Okay, babe. What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.

- que:
  - About him?
  ans:
  - No. Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control. For the first time since...all that. I'm scared.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - To take a picture.

- que:
  - You sure you don't want a ride to work?
  ans:
  - It's just across the park.

- que:
  - How was the meeting?
  ans:
  - Sobering...

- que:
  - Since when are you such a smart shopper?
  ans:
  - Since my little girl became a mom...

- que:
  - You disappointed in me?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.

- que:
  - Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
  ans:
  - There aren't any little boys on your floor.

- que:
  - Did everyone call everyone?
  ans:
  - They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.

- que:
  - What's that got to do with it?
  ans:
  - When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.

- que:
  - I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
  ans:
  - Why don't you two stick to reality.

- que:
  - You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
  ans:
  - I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.

- que:
  - I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
  ans:
  - Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.

- que:
  - You think that's the place she's buried?
  ans:
  - If they actually bothered to bury her.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.

- que:
  - Greta, come on. One burger with me?
  ans:
  - My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.

- que:
  - Mark, are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm just aces.

- que:
  - I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
  ans:
  - Nobody thinks that.

- que:
  - That's their problem.
  ans:
  - Who's Jacob?

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.

- que:
  - Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
  ans:
  - Poor woman...

- que:
  - Next life. Oh, what's that?
  ans:
  - My undying love. Have some.

- que:
  - You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
  ans:
  - He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.

- que:
  - Have another one, sounds like you need it.
  ans:
  - I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?

- que:
  - Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
  ans:
  - Stop saying that, it's bullshit.

- que:
  - All of us. Right?
  ans:
  - Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.

- que:
  - Vomit?
  ans:
  - Faint.

- que:
  - You, too?
  ans:
  - He invited me to his house last night.

- que:
  - How is he - ?
  ans:
  - It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.

- que:
  - And they thought you could re- place the Skipper?
  ans:
  - Your 'out.' This came for you.

- que:
  - My father! He's not - ?
  ans:
  - Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.

- que:
  - But if they do?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - A lot of people think like that.
  ans:
  - So?

- que:
  - Cyclops?
  ans:
  - Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.

- que:
  - Let's get back to work, and maybe we will be, soon.
  ans:
  - Yeah?

- que:
  - Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
  ans:
  - We'll have to look for them later.

- que:
  - Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
  ans:
  - Well?

- que:
  - What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
  ans:
  - Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.

- que:
  - Is there any way out of it?
  ans:
  - Seems to be all around...

- que:
  - Yes, Griff?
  ans:
  - All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.

- que:
  - Something wrong?
  ans:
  - The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.

- que:
  - It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
  ans:
  - Why do you say that?

- que:
  - Under water?
  ans:
  - As ready as we can be! I'll report to the Skipper.

- que:
  - You're sure it's Cyclops?
  ans:
  - Take a look.

- que:
  - Nothing we can do, now.
  ans:
  - What's the running time?

- que:
  - What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
  ans:
  - Point of view is everything. To us, your form of life is ugly as we appear to you.

- que:
  - Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
  ans:
  - On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.

- que:
  - It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
  ans:
  - Obviously.

- que:
  - See what?
  ans:
  - We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.

- que:
  - Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
  ans:
  - No. Black.

- que:
  - Are you alright, Wade?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.

- que:
  - You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
  ans:
  - ...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.

- que:
  - About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
  ans:
  - I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.

- que:
  - Has anybody offered to buy it?
  ans:
  - As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.

- que:
  - Twombley involved?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you boys up to?
  ans:
  - Same old shit.

- que:
  - LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
  ans:
  - Tell me.

- que:
  - How soon?
  ans:
  - This spring.

- que:
  - No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
  ans:
  - Oh.

- que:
  - Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
  ans:
  - Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.

- que:
  - Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
  ans:
  - Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.

- que:
  - Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
  ans:
  - Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.

- que:
  - If you get it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Drafted by the Red Sox.

- que:
  - You played for the Sox?
  ans:
  - Double A. New Britain.

- que:
  - Safety on?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
  ans:
  - No brag. Just fact.

- que:
  - Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
  ans:
  - Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.

- que:
  - How'd you get the job?
  ans:
  - Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.

- que:
  - Like you and Gordon?
  ans:
  - Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.

- que:
  - Where'd Twombley get shot?
  ans:
  - In the chest.

- que:
  - You stayed away?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What blood?
  ans:
  - On your sleeve.

- que:
  - I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
  ans:
  - Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.

- que:
  - Saw him do it?
  ans:
  - What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.

- que:
  - Lawford?
  ans:
  - Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.

- que:
  - Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
  ans:
  - Open the door. We're late.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - You know.

- que:
  - Break stuff?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's stupid.

- que:
  - Was it funny?
  ans:
  - To us it was.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I just think you used to be bad.

- que:
  - No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
  ans:
  - No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.

- que:
  - What then?
  ans:
  - It's stupid.

- que:
  - No what?
  ans:
  - No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.

- que:
  - What? You called Mommy? Just now?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Jesus, why?
  ans:
  - I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.

- que:
  - Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
  ans:
  - See, I knew you'd be mad.

- que:
  - Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
  ans:
  - I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.

- que:
  - She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are we going in this?
  ans:
  - Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.

- que:
  - Pop?
  ans:
  - Grandpa. My father. It's his.

- que:
  - How about a Big Mac?
  ans:
  - Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.

- que:
  - C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you want, then?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
  ans:
  - You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?

- que:
  - Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What are you sorry for?
  ans:
  - I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.

- que:
  - Where's the plow?
  ans:
  - Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.

- que:
  - You don't want the extra police pay?
  ans:
  - I'm not saying that.

- que:
  - What's the hurry?
  ans:
  - A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I figured you already heard.

- que:
  - Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
  ans:
  - Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.

- que:
  - You mean Twombley?
  ans:
  - Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

- que:
  - You want me to follow them to Littleton?
  ans:
  - What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.

- que:
  - Something bugging you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. A few things.

- que:
  - How you holding up, Wade?
  ans:
  - I'm fine, fine.

- que:
  - You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
  ans:
  - Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.

- que:
  - On what you pay me?
  ans:
  - Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.

- que:
  - What do I have to do for it?
  ans:
  - Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.

- que:
  - You? Why?
  ans:
  - Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.

- que:
  - Want to buy?
  ans:
  - Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.

- que:
  - I won't. You interested?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - You and Mel Gordon?
  ans:
  - Could be.

- que:
  - You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - She's grown up some, hasn't she?
  ans:
  - Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.

- que:
  - You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
  ans:
  - No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.

- que:
  - Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
  ans:
  - Yeah, lots.

- que:
  - Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.

- que:
  - Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
  ans:
  - Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

- que:
  - Did you get his number?
  ans:
  - I know who it is.

- que:
  - Good. Who?
  ans:
  - Mel Gordon.

- que:
  - How's she doing?
  ans:
  - Okay. She's fine.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
  ans:
  - You don't mean that.

- que:
  - Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
  ans:
  - Money.

- que:
  - The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.

- que:
  - What way?
  ans:
  - After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.

- que:
  - Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
  ans:
  - Alright. I'll think about it.

- que:
  - Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
  ans:
  - I know your parents.

- que:
  - Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
  ans:
  - The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.

- que:
  - Think they're alright?
  ans:
  - Of course! I would've heard.

- que:
  - Wade.
  ans:
  - How?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.

- que:
  - What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
  ans:
  - It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.

- que:
  - Going somewhere, Margie?
  ans:
  - I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.

- que:
  - You're not using it today?
  ans:
  - It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.

- que:
  - Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
  ans:
  - Coffee's perked.

- que:
  - Is...? She's dead then?
  ans:
  - It makes me sad.

- que:
  - Can --?
  ans:
  - Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
  ans:
  - How's that?

- que:
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.

- que:
  - Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
  ans:
  - Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--

- que:
  - I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
  ans:
  - He's asleep. We were up very late.

- que:
  - Something about my father?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.

- que:
  - Can't it wait, then?
  ans:
  - Take care, Wade.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.

- que:
  - Jack?
  ans:
  - The other guy.

- que:
  - Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
  ans:
  - It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.

- que:
  - He got his deer yet?
  ans:
  - Sleeping.

- que:
  - From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
  ans:
  - How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.

- que:
  - We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where's Ma?
  ans:
  - She's coming.

- que:
  - Is there something wrong with the phone?
  ans:
  - In the living room.

- que:
  - Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
  ans:
  - Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.

- que:
  - Wade?
  ans:
  - There was something. It happened up your way.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Twombley.

- que:
  - You think Jack shot him?
  ans:
  - Well, it was an accident.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - The night before the shooting.

- que:
  - How was she?
  ans:
  - Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.

- que:
  - Haven't you already done a bit of that?
  ans:
  - No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.

- que:
  - Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
  ans:
  - No thanks. I don't drink.

- que:
  - Well, do you still plan to get married?
  ans:
  - I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.

- que:
  - Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
  ans:
  - I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.

- que:
  - Want to know what I think happened?
  ans:
  - Find them everywhere.

- que:
  - Which is?
  ans:
  - That it wasn't an accident.

- que:
  - Then who shot him?
  ans:
  - Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.

- que:
  - They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
  ans:
  - I don't know. You tell me.

- que:
  - Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
  ans:
  - So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

- que:
  - I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
  ans:
  - I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.

- que:
  - Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
  ans:
  - It may have happened, but not the way you said.

- que:
  - You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
  ans:
  - It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.

- que:
  - Wade, are you alright?
  ans:
  - But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.

- que:
  - You don't want to say hi to your father?
  ans:
  - I'm sure he's busy.

- que:
  - Don't you even want to ask?
  ans:
  - Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.

- que:
  - Back at The Fishbowl?
  ans:
  - I know, Mom. It was great... really.

- que:
  - No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
  ans:
  - When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.

- que:
  - Some kids were teasing you?
  ans:
  - That's not really the point.

- que:
  - Yes dear?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.

- que:
  - Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.

- que:
  - That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
  ans:
  - Fuck off, you stupid asshole.

- que:
  - How was... ...the ballet?
  ans:
  - It was the experience of a lifetime.

- que:
  - Been better, Dad... You?
  ans:
  - Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

- que:
  - Did we warn them off?
  ans:
  - Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.

- que:
  - Do you see the maintenance panel?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - Who's flying the fucking plane?
  ans:
  - I'm doing what I can.

- que:
  - Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - How we doing, Colonel?
  ans:
  - We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.

- que:
  - Can we do that?
  ans:
  - We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.

- que:
  - They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
  ans:
  - Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.

- que:
  - The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
  ans:
  - To swear you in as President.

- que:
  - Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. President.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because it is my duty.

- que:
  - The rest of the secret service?
  ans:
  - Dead.

- que:
  - How many others killed?
  ans:
  - Nine.

- que:
  - Who did this?
  ans:
  - We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.

- que:
  - why did they do that?
  ans:
  - Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.

- que:
  - Where are we now?
  ans:
  - Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.

- que:
  - We copy. Stand by... Tower?
  ans:
  - Tower, here.

- que:
  - A dubious distinction, no?
  ans:
  - I guess it depends on your perspective.

- que:
  - And all these rooms here?
  ans:
  - Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.

- que:
  - How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
  ans:
  - Scared. We're scared.

- que:
  - What do you want with us?
  ans:
  - Now, or he dies, please.

- que:
  - What do you know of my husband?
  ans:
  - I know he left you behind.

- que:
  - Why? Do you enjoy it?
  ans:
  - I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.

- que:
  - You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
  ans:
  - You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.

- que:
  - You'll do it?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.

- que:
  - Twenty minutes?
  ans:
  - You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.

- que:
  - Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
  ans:
  - Gravity.

- que:
  - Can't it wait?
  ans:
  - No, Mr. President. It can't.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I miss you. And I miss her.

- que:
  - How did your speech go?
  ans:
  - Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.

- que:
  - Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
  ans:
  - I don't know why you stayed.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Flying the plane.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - The fax machines.

- que:
  - Where are we sending it?
  ans:
  - White House Situation room.

- que:
  - Did they say anything about my family?
  ans:
  - They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - AGENT We're under attack.

- que:
  - Where's my family?
  ans:
  - AGENT We're handling it, sir.

- que:
  - who can I say is calling?
  ans:
  - This is the President.

- que:
  - Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
  ans:
  - Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....

- que:
  - No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
  ans:
  - He and the NRA don't like the wording.

- que:
  - Did we tape the Duke game?
  ans:
  - I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.

- que:
  - I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
  ans:
  - Shepherd.

- que:
  - A MiG? Where the hell are we?
  ans:
  - Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.

- que:
  - How long's it been since you flew, sir?
  ans:
  - Twenty-five years.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I just wish it was that simple.

- que:
  - What's the story?
  ans:
  - Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...

- que:
  - Did you feel that?
  ans:
  - Yes I did...

- que:
  - What is it, Mary?
  ans:
  - Um... Do you people scream right when you... you know.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - You better take this.

- que:
  - Ted, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - Ask Simon.

- que:
  - Elaine, what happened to us?
  ans:
  - Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.

- que:
  - Who's that, Ted?
  ans:
  - Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.

- que:
  - Ted! What are you...?
  ans:
  - I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.

- que:
  - I've never used the word insane, Ted.
  ans:
  - What are you doing, Ted?

- que:
  - What word would you use, Elaine?
  ans:
  - Ted, there's no time to explain.

- que:
  - What will happen to him, Ted?
  ans:
  - The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

- que:
  - Are you afraid?
  ans:
  - Not when I'm with you, Ted.

- que:
  - What can I do, Doctor Rumack?
  ans:
  - You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.

- que:
  - Is that a good sign, Doctor?
  ans:
  - The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.

- que:
  - Is he making any progress, Doctor?
  ans:
  - Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.

- que:
  - So mentally ill?
  ans:
  - Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.

- que:
  - Have you got it straightened out now?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Can't we change course?
  ans:
  - We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.

- que:
  - Your career! What about the lives of those people out there. Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
  ans:
  - Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.

- que:
  - I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
  ans:
  - We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.

- que:
  - Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
  ans:
  - We'll have to check, Jimmy. It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.

- que:
  - Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
  ans:
  - It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.

- que:
  - Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
  ans:
  - Scraps.

- que:
  - Can I hold him?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Take this, Joey. It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - Sixteen 'C', why?
  ans:
  - He's carrying a bomb.

- que:
  - What should I say?
  ans:
  - Anything. Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.

- que:
  - Captain Oveur?
  ans:
  - Mr. Kurtz, I presume.

- que:
  - Do you think it's necessary to explain everything?
  ans:
  - Good to be aboard, gentlemen.

- que:
  - You folks need any help?
  ans:
  - Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.

- que:
  - Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you have an appointment, sir?
  ans:
  - No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.

- que:
  - Are you on the Mercury mission?
  ans:
  - That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.

- que:
  - Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
  ans:
  - That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.

- que:
  - Excuse me, are you alright? I noticed you talking to yourself. I'm a nurse. Can I be of some help?
  ans:
  - Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.

- que:
  - Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
  ans:
  - Yes. He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried on Mercury.

- que:
  - Thank you. Cream?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.

- que:
  - Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
  ans:
  - No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

- que:
  - But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
  ans:
  - No. I'm all alone.

- que:
  - Something about a plane with no pilot?
  ans:
  - Surely you can't be serious.

- que:
  - ...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
  ans:
  - I am serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?

- que:
  - Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
  ans:
  - I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.

- que:
  - Captain, how soon can we land?
  ans:
  - I can't tell.

- que:
  - Can't you take a guess?
  ans:
  - Well...not for another two hours.

- que:
  - What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

- que:
  - Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes, of course.

- que:
  - A hospital? What is it?
  ans:
  - It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.

- que:
  - What was it we had for dinner tonight?
  ans:
  - Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

- que:
  - What did he have?
  ans:
  - He had fish.

- que:
  - Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
  ans:
  - He had fish, too.

- que:
  - Just how serious is it, doctor?
  ans:
  - Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.

- que:
  - Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
  ans:
  - Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?

- que:
  - Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
  ans:
  - You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.

- que:
  - You expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - But if you'll just give me...

- que:
  - Ted, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.

- que:
  - Headquarters!? What is it?
  ans:
  - Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.

- que:
  - Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
  ans:
  - I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.

- que:
  - What's his problem?
  ans:
  - That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

- que:
  - What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
  ans:
  - Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.

- que:
  - See them, Elaine?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Airsick?
  ans:
  - I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.

- que:
  - Did you decide on a runway yet?
  ans:
  - Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.

- que:
  - How ya doing, honey?
  ans:
  - I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

- que:
  - Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - I will, but Jim won't.

- que:
  - Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Roger.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - We have clearance, Clarence.

- que:
  - No, why don't you take care ot it?
  ans:
  - No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - There's a little girl on board who's ill and...

- que:
  - Do you feel all right, sir?
  ans:
  - Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.

- que:
  - Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
  ans:
  - No. No thank you.

- que:
  - The cockpit? What is it?
  ans:
  - Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.

- que:
  - Would you go up, please?
  ans:
  - Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

- que:
  - Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
  ans:
  - You've got me all wrong. I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - You are Cassandra?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - He's not here. Why ask me?
  ans:
  - The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.

- que:
  - Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours. Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
  ans:
  - You don't have squat.

- que:
  - Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
  ans:
  - Lay off, asshole.

- que:
  - William Harcourt?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - I am George.
  ans:
  - Here?

- que:
  - Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right? Whatta you care?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is wrong?
  ans:
  - Well... yes, quite possibly.

- que:
  - What's this? What's going on?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - And that fits?
  ans:
  - Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.

- que:
  - And still it fits?
  ans:
  - Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.

- que:
  - How the hell do you know that?
  ans:
  - A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.

- que:
  - Aw-right. What about the other guy?
  ans:
  - She didn't know him. But she said her son might.

- que:
  - Did you talk to him?
  ans:
  - He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.

- que:
  - Who said that?
  ans:
  - At the end of the bar.

- que:
  - Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
  ans:
  - Uh, Matthew...

- que:
  - You know that guy?
  ans:
  - From quarantine, when my people first arrived here. He and I were housed together.

- que:
  - How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure. I knew that...

- que:
  - I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit. How long did it take you to learn English?
  ans:
  - Three months. We learn quickly. We adapt. It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.

- que:
  - Which one is that? Raw what?
  ans:
  - This is mole. It's good.

- que:
  - I'll bet. Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
  ans:
  - Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.

- que:
  - So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
  ans:
  - Ss'loka'. It means literally \"small but intelligent creature\". It loses much in the translation.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - Todd Watson. The assistant manager.

- que:
  - When will Strader return?
  ans:
  - I believe he is probably lying.

- que:
  - So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
  ans:
  - My wife? She worries about me.

- que:
  - You are married?
  ans:
  - Was. Divorced.

- que:
  - She's going to divorce me.
  ans:
  - Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep, don't you?

- que:
  - George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
  ans:
  - She's very progressive. I'm certain she's considering it.

- que:
  - Stop the car.
  ans:
  - To the... to the beach?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Please, I must get out here.

- que:
  - What was that about?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart. So what the hell's the connection?
  ans:
  - You must leave me alone on this.

- que:
  - How potent?
  ans:
  - Like your cocaine, I suppose. The \"high\" lasts several hours. We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.

- que:
  - We? You've taken it?
  ans:
  - We all did.

- que:
  - Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
  ans:
  - Your people don't know about this part of out past. And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.

- que:
  - No, George -- you're missing the point. The drug is evidence. We need to have the evidence, ya know?
  ans:
  - Uh, George...

- que:
  - Where is the drug? Where have they taken it?
  ans:
  - George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

- que:
  - Why? What's the big goddamn deal?
  ans:
  - Fuck procedure.

- que:
  - Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
  ans:
  - Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.

- que:
  - How do I look?
  ans:
  - You look very good.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.

- que:
  - We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
  ans:
  - To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.

- que:
  - Who else can I ask around here?
  ans:
  - Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James Anderson. He isn't in today. He took the afternoon off.

- que:
  - That where Anderson worked?
  ans:
  - Yes it is. Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there. I don't know how these fellas do it.

- que:
  - Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
  ans:
  - For you, anything.

- que:
  - Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
  ans:
  - Sure. Just a minute.

- que:
  - Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again-- Is your name Porter?
  ans:
  - Ss'kya'ta'.

- que:
  - One of the two men was Hubley, right? What about the other one? Did you know him?
  ans:
  - Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.

- que:
  - You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
  ans:
  - You mean the Blob? They're finishing up now.

- que:
  - What kind of test?
  ans:
  - Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.

- que:
  - Yeah, Sykes?
  ans:
  - Captain. I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - Granger and Pitts are already on it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay? But--

- que:
  - You got your vest?
  ans:
  - Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.

- que:
  - Would you, Sir?
  ans:
  - Can't lock up...

- que:
  - Say again? All after incinerators?
  ans:
  - I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.

- que:
  - Could it be intelligent?
  ans:
  - That's it. See it? Emergency venting.

- que:
  - And it's too late to shut it down?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

- que:
  - All right. Let's get on it. What'll you need?
  ans:
  - It's going to be closer. You better get going.

- que:
  - Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
  ans:
  - HOW MUCH TIME?

- que:
  - Have they located my daughter yet?
  ans:
  - Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...

- que:
  - Is she...?
  ans:
  - Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age, sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - That's right.
  ans:
  - What about you? What's your interest in this?

- que:
  - Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
  ans:
  - It's all I could get. Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything. Days off are worse.

- que:
  - What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
  ans:
  - If I go.

- que:
  - You never said anything about an android being here! Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

- que:
  - That the atmosphere processor?
  ans:
  - Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the planet. They're completely automated. We manufacture them, by the way.

- que:
  - What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?
  ans:
  - Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life.

- que:
  - You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
  ans:
  - I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.

- que:
  - Still nothing from the colony?
  ans:
  - Dead on all channels.

- que:
  - What's he scanning for?
  ans:
  - PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.

- que:
  - How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
  ans:
  - Thirty-eight...simulated.

- que:
  - Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
  ans:
  - Where are your parents? You have to try...

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How do you feel?
  ans:
  - All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...

- que:
  - Yes, Hicks?
  ans:
  - Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.

- que:
  - Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
  ans:
  - All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.

- que:
  - How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
  ans:
  - ...We're coming in.

- que:
  - Alive?
  ans:
  - Unknown. But, it looks like all of them. Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.

- que:
  - We're not making that out too well. What is it?
  ans:
  - Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose.

- que:
  - I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
  ans:
  - Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

- que:
  - Poor bastard.
  ans:
  - The corner! Ready?

- que:
  - How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
  ans:
  - About seventeen days.

- que:
  - Now many?
  ans:
  - Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.

- que:
  - Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
  ans:
  - If it comes to that, I'll do us both. Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.

- que:
  - No. Have you?
  ans:
  - Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.

- que:
  - Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.

- que:
  - Uh, what's next?
  ans:
  - We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.

- que:
  - What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?
  ans:
  - Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.

- que:
  - They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?
  ans:
  - Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.

- que:
  - And how are we today?
  ans:
  - Terrible.

- que:
  - Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
  ans:
  - No.. I've slept enough.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Newt. My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.

- que:
  - What about me?
  ans:
  - I don't want you for a friend.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because you'll be gone soon, like the others. Like everybody. You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.

- que:
  - You promise?
  ans:
  - Cross my heart.

- que:
  - And hope to die?
  ans:
  - I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.

- que:
  - The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody.

- que:
  - I guess we're not leaving, right?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Newt.

- que:
  - Why do they tell little kids that?
  ans:
  - Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.

- que:
  - Did one of those things grow inside her?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.

- que:
  - Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
  ans:
  - No, it's different, honey.

- que:
  - Did you ever have a baby?
  ans:
  - Yes. A little girl.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Gone.

- que:
  - Wah...? Where are...?
  ans:
  - Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble.

- que:
  - DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
  ans:
  - Sure. Go left.

- que:
  - Mommy...Mommy?
  ans:
  - Right here, baby. Right here.

- que:
  - Are we going to sleep now?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Can we dream?
  ans:
  - Yes, honey. I think we both can.

- que:
  - How many colonists?
  ans:
  - Indeed.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Maestro.

- que:
  - And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is there a part for me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In a harem.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - A brothel.

- que:
  - What does he look like?
  ans:
  - You might be disappointed.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.

- que:
  - Well, what does it matter to you?
  ans:
  - Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.

- que:
  - What did you think of the music?
  ans:
  - No, she's fine.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.

- que:
  - No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
  ans:
  - Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.

- que:
  - And how will you make him keep it?
  ans:
  - How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I want to go back to Vienna.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.

- que:
  - Do you think that's funny?
  ans:
  - Don't be stupid.

- que:
  - All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.

- que:
  - My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
  ans:
  - Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.

- que:
  - There's a young girl to see you.
  ans:
  - May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?

- que:
  - What does she want?
  ans:
  - We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl.

- que:
  - Yes, my love?
  ans:
  - These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your father is dead.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - No one.

- que:
  - What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
  ans:
  - I'm not telling you.

- que:
  - How charming. But why did he not come himself?
  ans:
  - He's terribly busy, sir.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.

- que:
  - Then he didn't send you?
  ans:
  - No, sir. This is my own idea.

- que:
  - Originals?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - These are originals?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

- que:
  - Tonight?
  ans:
  - Alone.

- que:
  - Isn't it obvious?
  ans:
  - It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.

- que:
  - Why you?
  ans:
  - I was at hand.

- que:
  - Am I interrupting something?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Where's our friend?
  ans:
  - He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.

- que:
  - I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
  ans:
  - He's doing his best.

- que:
  - Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you?
  ans:
  - I see that you're expecting.

- que:
  - When, may I ask?
  ans:
  - And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.

- que:
  - So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
  ans:
  - And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?

- que:
  - Yes. He is a little strange.
  ans:
  - Do you hear him? Do you?

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Ah, now! Here she comes.

- que:
  - Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
  ans:
  - I'd like a little wine, if you have it.

- que:
  - Wine?
  ans:
  - Just one year.

- que:
  - Who was your teacher?
  ans:
  - I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.

- que:
  - What a charming idea. May I see?
  ans:
  - It's just a trifle, of course.

- que:
  - May I try it?
  ans:
  - Majesty.

- que:
  - Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
  ans:
  - You do me too much honour, Sire.

- que:
  - Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
  ans:
  - You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.

- que:
  - Do you like this, Salieri?
  ans:
  - In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.

- que:
  - What? On one hearing only?
  ans:
  - I think so, Sire, yes.

- que:
  - It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
  ans:
  - Yes, indeed.

- que:
  - So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
  ans:
  - Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.

- que:
  - Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? How shall one say, Director?
  ans:
  - I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.

- que:
  - Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
  ans:
  - Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.

- que:
  - Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
  ans:
  - Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.

- que:
  - Excuse me, but how old are you?
  ans:
  - Ah! By all means.

- que:
  - Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
  ans:
  - Yes, Sire.

- que:
  - It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
  ans:
  - Well, yes, I admit it is.

- que:
  - Would you tell me why?
  ans:
  - Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

- que:
  - Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
  ans:
  - I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.

- que:
  - Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
  ans:
  - In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.

- que:
  - Yes, what about him?
  ans:
  - He's here.

- que:
  - Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
  ans:
  - Why are you here?

- que:
  - Do you always live like this?
  ans:
  - She's very tired, poor creature. You know me, I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.

- que:
  - Don't you have a maid?
  ans:
  - Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

- que:
  - How is your financial situation?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Oh, let's not talk about it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's a secret.

- que:
  - Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
  ans:
  - Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.

- que:
  - I will, sir.
  ans:
  - Papa, is this your idea?

- que:
  - Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you, sir.

- que:
  - Do any pupils come to the house?
  ans:
  - Not that I've seen.

- que:
  - Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.

- que:
  - Really? What is it he's writing?
  ans:
  - Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.

- que:
  - Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
  ans:
  - I think I've found out about the money, sir.

- que:
  - Where does he work?
  ans:
  - In there, sir.

- que:
  - Why? What has happened?
  ans:
  - You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.

- que:
  - What medicine?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He has pains.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.

- que:
  - Is he working?
  ans:
  - I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.

- que:
  - Are you Herr Mozart?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.

- que:
  - Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
  ans:
  - Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.

- que:
  - What did he say? What did he say?
  ans:
  - Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.

- que:
  - That kind of music should be punishable by death.
  ans:
  - Well?

- que:
  - Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, well, it's all good fun.

- que:
  - Animals?
  ans:
  - No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.

- que:
  - What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Can I see it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because there's nothing to see.

- que:
  - And which one of them do you want me to teach?
  ans:
  - What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow. Hannah! Come this way.

- que:
  - This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid I am.

- que:
  - Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
  ans:
  - Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.

- que:
  - Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
  ans:
  - Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Mio caro Adone.

- que:
  - So you are. How is your pretty wife?
  ans:
  - She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.

- que:
  - Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
  ans:
  - I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.

- que:
  - Whom did they choose?
  ans:
  - Herr Sommer.

- que:
  - You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
  ans:
  - No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.

- que:
  - Do you have a daughter?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid not.

- que:
  - Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
  ans:
  - Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.

- que:
  - Ah. Italian?
  ans:
  - Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

- que:
  - Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
  ans:
  - It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.

- que:
  - I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
  ans:
  - Oh no! My wife took it out in time.

- que:
  - Oh, Excellency, would you?
  ans:
  - With all my heart, Mozart.

- que:
  - What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
  ans:
  - I think it's marvelous. Truly.

- que:
  - It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
  ans:
  - I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I never knew that music like that was possible.

- que:
  - What work?
  ans:
  - A Mass for the dead.

- que:
  - What dead? Who is dead?
  ans:
  - A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.

- que:
  - How long will you give me?
  ans:
  - Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.

- que:
  - What happened? Is it over?
  ans:
  - Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.

- que:
  - You mean she's not coming back?
  ans:
  - You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.

- que:
  - Do you mean that?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm too young to be so sick.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The man. He's here.

- que:
  - What man?
  ans:
  - Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.

- que:
  - Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
  ans:
  - Would you? Actually, you could.

- que:
  - Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
  ans:
  - A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.

- que:
  - Where did I stop?
  ans:
  - The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.

- que:
  - So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
  ans:
  - Consigned to flames of woe.

- que:
  - A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - We ended in F Major?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - Common time.

- que:
  - Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
  ans:
  - With the tenors.

- que:
  - Also identical?
  ans:
  - Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.

- que:
  - And that's all?
  ans:
  - Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.

- que:
  - Do you have me?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
  ans:
  - Oh no. I'm not tired at all.

- que:
  - Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
  ans:
  - I'm not leaving you.

- que:
  - Oh? Have I seen it?
  ans:
  - I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.

- que:
  - You mean in Turkey?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - Then why especially does it have to be in German?
  ans:
  - Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.

- que:
  - Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
  ans:
  - Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.

- que:
  - What are you doing, Herr Director?
  ans:
  - Taking out what you should never have put in.

- que:
  - What is what?
  ans:
  - Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.

- que:
  - Is the Emperor angry with me?
  ans:
  - On the contrary.

- que:
  - Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
  ans:
  - Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.

- que:
  - Who is on this committee?
  ans:
  - I don't think it was really decided, Director.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - In the sight of God that is a sin.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.

- que:
  - Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
  ans:
  - That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.

- que:
  - Are they?
  ans:
  - Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.

- que:
  - How well are you trained in music?
  ans:
  - I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Here in Vienna.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I regret it is not too familiar.

- que:
  - I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
  ans:
  - Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.

- que:
  - Ah - you've heard that?
  ans:
  - All Vienna has heard that.

- que:
  - Do you hear me?
  ans:
  - He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.

- que:
  - No? Was Mozart a good man?
  ans:
  - My son, no one can speak for God.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
  ans:
  - What difference does that make?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.

- que:
  - You mean that play?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - He's setting that play to music?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you absolutely sure?
  ans:
  - I've seen the manuscript.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Never mind.

- que:
  - What anger?
  ans:
  - About the ballet.

- que:
  - Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
  ans:
  - Yes, in the third act.

- que:
  - I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
  ans:
  - For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.

- que:
  - Oh yes, yes. And that was?
  ans:
  - Ah.

- que:
  - What? Who the devil are you?
  ans:
  - WOMAN I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.

- que:
  - What do you mean - now?
  ans:
  - WOMAN Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.

- que:
  - Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
  ans:
  - WOMAN Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.

- que:
  - Who is she?
  ans:
  - She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.

- que:
  - What does he want?
  ans:
  - He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.

- que:
  - Can we come in?
  ans:
  - Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.

- que:
  - But he's all right?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.

- que:
  - Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
  ans:
  - The American? Yes, duck.

- que:
  - You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
  ans:
  - I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.

- que:
  - Dr. Hirsch?
  ans:
  - Go about your duties.

- que:
  - What exactly did he call out?
  ans:
  - He said 'Jack'.

- que:
  - What happened to them?
  ans:
  - No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.

- que:
  - Did he say a wolf?
  ans:
  - Yes, I believe he did.

- que:
  - It's a full moon. Where is he?
  ans:
  - At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...

- que:
  - Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
  ans:
  - Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.

- que:
  - Has his friend appeared to him again?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - David says Jack comes to warn him.

- que:
  - Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And what else?
  ans:
  - I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.

- que:
  - You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
  ans:
  - No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.

- que:
  - Dr. Hirsch?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.

- que:
  - What shall we do?
  ans:
  - Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.

- que:
  - Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
  ans:
  - He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.

- que:
  - The zoo? Is he rational?
  ans:
  - Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.

- que:
  - Is David acting strangely?
  ans:
  - No, not really.

- que:
  - Could you get here without any trouble?
  ans:
  - Yes, I should think so.

- que:
  - You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
  ans:
  - He's fine. We'll come right over.

- que:
  - Shall I send a car?
  ans:
  - No, a cab will be faster.

- que:
  - What shall we do?
  ans:
  - Tea would be nice.

- que:
  - David?
  ans:
  - I doubt it. But it's something to do.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - It was a wolf.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A wolf.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - You haven't eaten your lunch.

- que:
  - Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
  ans:
  - Call me David.

- que:
  - Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
  ans:
  - This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.

- que:
  - Will you give me a break?
  ans:
  - You're a very beautiful girl.

- que:
  - I was. What are you reading?
  ans:
  - A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

- que:
  - Do you like it?
  ans:
  - I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.

- que:
  - What do you dream about?
  ans:
  - I dream of death mostly.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - That's not really a very proper question.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Twenty-eight.

- que:
  - Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
  ans:
  - My best friend. My very best friend.

- que:
  - Shall I read to you?
  ans:
  - What? Oh, yes, please.

- que:
  - Hello. You all right?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry I woke you up.

- que:
  - Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.

- que:
  - How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
  ans:
  - Not just a patient -- me.

- que:
  - You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.

- que:
  - All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
  ans:
  - Now I'm embarrassed.

- que:
  - Are you better now?
  ans:
  - I'll let you know the next full moon.

- que:
  - You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
  ans:
  - My friend Jack was just here.

- que:
  - I was dreaming again?
  ans:
  - I would think so.

- que:
  - Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
  ans:
  - I was awake and he was in my room.

- que:
  - Do me an enormous favor?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I do, but go to work.

- que:
  - Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
  ans:
  - The next corner we can get a cab.

- que:
  - David, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We had an argument. He's being silly.

- que:
  - No what?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Feeling better?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How are we feeling tonight?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - He all right?
  ans:
  - Yes, I should think. He called out just now.

- que:
  - Why on earth do you say that?
  ans:
  - I looked.

- que:
  - Has he been refusing food?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

- que:
  - You did, did you?
  ans:
  - This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.

- que:
  - Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
  ans:
  - No, but we're about to.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.

- que:
  - Alex?
  ans:
  - Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.

- que:
  - What are you going to see?
  ans:
  - An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.

- que:
  - Do you have bad dreams, too?
  ans:
  - Some, everyone does.

- que:
  - Bambi?
  ans:
  - Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - You're in a hospital in London.

- que:
  - The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
  ans:
  - You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.

- que:
  - Lunatic?
  ans:
  - Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.

- que:
  - There were witnesses?
  ans:
  - So they said.

- que:
  - You've never had bad dreams before?
  ans:
  - Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

- que:
  - Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
  ans:
  - I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.

- que:
  - Did you see Jack?
  ans:
  - No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.

- que:
  - Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
  ans:
  - I really don't know.

- que:
  - You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
  ans:
  - Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.

- que:
  - Are you cold?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
  ans:
  - Well, I like it here.

- que:
  - Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
  ans:
  - I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.

- que:
  - Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
  ans:
  - She says she 'likes me too much'.

- que:
  - Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
  ans:
  - That's a wolf's head.

- que:
  - Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
  ans:
  - That's not a spear. It's a pike.

- que:
  - Shall we?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - It's a five-pointed star.

- que:
  - What the hell was that all about?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.

- que:
  - Beware the moon?
  ans:
  - Come on, I'm freezing.

- que:
  - What do you think was wrong?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - Did you hear that?
  ans:
  - I heard that.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - Could be a lot of things.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - A coyote.

- que:
  - Shit! David, what is that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Come on.

- que:
  - Come on, where?
  ans:
  - Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.

- que:
  - Plan?
  ans:
  - Let's just keep walking.

- que:
  - Oh shit. What is that?
  ans:
  - A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.

- que:
  - See anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Jack?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you when we get there.

- que:
  - Are you going to help me up?
  ans:
  - Nice to see you.

- que:
  - Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.

- que:
  - Rudy Levine the shmuck?
  ans:
  - Life mocks me even in death.

- que:
  - Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
  ans:
  - I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I wanted to see you.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.

- que:
  - What can I say, Jack?
  ans:
  - You don't have to say anything.

- que:
  - Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
  ans:
  - If I was still alive, I probably would.

- que:
  - What about the zoo?
  ans:
  - I want you to meet some people.

- que:
  - How shall I do it?
  ans:
  - I could hang myself.

- que:
  - Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
  ans:
  - No, thank you, Doctor.

- que:
  - Why don't we ask him?
  ans:
  - The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...

- que:
  - What can we do to assist you?
  ans:
  - Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.

- que:
  - Excuse me. Yes?
  ans:
  - Roger Mathison, Doctor.

- que:
  - What here?
  ans:
  - Campari and soda would do nicely.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.

- que:
  - Do you have any hot soup?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Hot chocolate?
  ans:
  - We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.

- que:
  - Then you have some hot tea?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
  ans:
  - He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.

- que:
  - And what, Sergeant?
  ans:
  - I don't rightly know, sir.

- que:
  - Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
  ans:
  - I want to know why .

- que:
  - Oscar, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.

- que:
  - No kidding?
  ans:
  - No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.

- que:
  - Matt?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one ...

- que:
  - He has?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - About twenty-four thousand.

- que:
  - Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Let me have ten bucks?
  ans:
  - Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.

- que:
  - Whose death?
  ans:
  - It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.

- que:
  - Where you been?
  ans:
  - Where do you think I've been? I took the baby for a stroll in the park.

- que:
  - What's the matter, Charlie?
  ans:
  - I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.

- que:
  - Mr. Dickson in yet?
  ans:
  - Not yet, Mr. Clark.

- que:
  - Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
  ans:
  - Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.

- que:
  - What about?
  ans:
  - We'll discuss that in the board room.

- que:
  - I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.

- que:
  - Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
  ans:
  - That's very simple. I was home.

- que:
  - Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

- que:
  - What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
  ans:
  - Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.

- que:
  - You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
  ans:
  - She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.

- que:
  - Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
  ans:
  - Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you ...

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.

- que:
  - Line?
  ans:
  - Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.

- que:
  - Well, aren't you going to invite me?
  ans:
  - You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.

- que:
  - Don't you know?
  ans:
  - My apartment.

- que:
  - What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yes, now.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.

- que:
  - Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
  ans:
  - This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me. What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?

- que:
  - John, how's your wife this morning?
  ans:
  - Much better this morning, thank you.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.

- que:
  - Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course.

- que:
  - Tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.

- que:
  - Happy now?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
  ans:
  - In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I ... I ...

- que:
  - Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
  ans:
  - Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.

- que:
  - Directors, eh? Long faces?
  ans:
  - In Mr. Sampson's office.

- que:
  - You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
  ans:
  - Numbers? No, never mind.

- que:
  - Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.

- que:
  - Got my letter?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you.

- que:
  - Mr. Dickson?
  ans:
  - Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you ...

- que:
  - Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
  ans:
  - I haven't any.

- que:
  - You haven't got a uniform?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
  ans:
  - Why, I don't know.

- que:
  - Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Looks good. How much did it cost?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.

- que:
  - And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk ... Not a bad thought, eh?
  ans:
  - What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.

- que:
  - I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
  ans:
  - I already told him I was home.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
  ans:
  - Well ... uh ... I ...

- que:
  - I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
  ans:
  - She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?

- que:
  - Why pick on him ?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What time did this thing happen?
  ans:
  - The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.

- que:
  - All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
  ans:
  - If he can do it, yes.

- que:
  - Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
  ans:
  - You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.

- que:
  - My wife? What's she got to do with you?
  ans:
  - No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.

- que:
  - Well, Sampson, what is it?
  ans:
  - Here's the data on the Clyde deal.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.

- que:
  - Did you get the case for the securities?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Mine too?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.

- que:
  - What'll we do?
  ans:
  - We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.

- que:
  - Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
  ans:
  - Don't you think I know it?

- que:
  - Is it safe?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Is that busy husband of mine busy?
  ans:
  - He's at a board meeting.

- que:
  - Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Oh, you think I'm lying?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
  ans:
  - Yeah, swell.

- que:
  - What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Well ... ?
  ans:
  - Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.

- que:
  - What's keeping you?
  ans:
  - Oh, Charlie again.

- que:
  - Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
  ans:
  - Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?

- que:
  - What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
  ans:
  - Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.

- que:
  - Did you talk to him?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.

- que:
  - Yes, why?
  ans:
  - He was in the bank yesterday.

- que:
  - He was here?
  ans:
  - He came to see Mr. Cluett.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What did you find out, Mike?
  ans:
  - I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.

- que:
  - Never mind all that. What did you find out?
  ans:
  - He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.

- que:
  - Dude Finlay?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
  ans:
  - Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.

- que:
  - What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
  ans:
  - It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.

- que:
  - I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
  ans:
  - That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters ...

- que:
  - Was it twelve o'clock?
  ans:
  - Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...

- que:
  - It couldn't have been earlier?
  ans:
  - No. It wasn't earlier because...

- que:
  - Then who changed it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - So you were home last night?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What time did you get in?
  ans:
  - Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.

- que:
  - Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Then where were you?
  ans:
  - You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.

- que:
  - How are you fixed?
  ans:
  - I'm okay, Matt.

- que:
  - You've got enough?
  ans:
  - That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.

- que:
  - Everybody in?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - Where's Charlie?
  ans:
  - Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.

- que:
  - You can ride like that?
  ans:
  - Sometimes a wound will kill.

- que:
  - We got a problem here, brother?
  ans:
  - Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - How many of them did he kill?
  ans:
  - Two.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...

- que:
  - What you sayin' boy?
  ans:
  - I think I recognize you.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.

- que:
  - Ride with me, cousin?
  ans:
  - There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.

- que:
  - You're not scared, are you?
  ans:
  - Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.

- que:
  - What is wrong with you?
  ans:
  - In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.

- que:
  - You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
  ans:
  - She got two of them.

- que:
  - After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
  ans:
  - The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.

- que:
  - But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So what do we do, General Lee?
  ans:
  - Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.

- que:
  - What will be?
  ans:
  - Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - Missed you, cousin.

- que:
  - Where'd you get all these riders?
  ans:
  - We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking...

- que:
  - Cannon or Gatling?
  ans:
  - Both would be nice.

- que:
  - Which one, right or left?
  ans:
  - The brown one.

- que:
  - Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
  ans:
  - Cole, he didn't mean that.

- que:
  - They gonna rush us?
  ans:
  - They're just insurance in case we run.

- que:
  - All right, all right. Jesse James never yelled at folk...
  ans:
  - Of course! Uh, sir?

- que:
  - Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
  ans:
  - Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.

- que:
  - You're right, sir.
  ans:
  - East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?

- que:
  - Then why can't I go in there?
  ans:
  - On account of we're robbing it.

- que:
  - Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
  ans:
  - Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.

- que:
  - Where the hell were you?
  ans:
  - I had you covered. From back there.

- que:
  - My little Web did that?
  ans:
  - Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.

- que:
  - Web died fighting?
  ans:
  - Died a hero.

- que:
  - What do you say, sir?
  ans:
  - Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.

- que:
  - He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
  ans:
  - The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.

- que:
  - Distracting enough for you?
  ans:
  - Pff. They hardly even noticed you.

- que:
  - Such as?
  ans:
  - You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.

- que:
  - Frank, don't you have something to say?
  ans:
  - You're doing just fine.

- que:
  - What kind of story are they going to believe?
  ans:
  - That just might work.

- que:
  - \"Big and older\"?
  ans:
  - Heard of him.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Pinkertons. It's the railroad.

- que:
  - Fine. How'd it go out here?
  ans:
  - And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.

- que:
  - I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
  ans:
  - It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.

- que:
  - Maybe it started out that way. But now...
  ans:
  - The posters?

- que:
  - A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
  ans:
  - We're drunk.

- que:
  - They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
  ans:
  - You taking sides against me, now, Frank?

- que:
  - Got any ideas, little brother?
  ans:
  - Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.

- que:
  - He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
  ans:
  - Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.

- que:
  - A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
  ans:
  - I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

- que:
  - Yeah, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.

- que:
  - So what was he?
  ans:
  - I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.

- que:
  - How much of that story is true?
  ans:
  - Everything but the boring parts.

- que:
  - Did you kill Yankees?
  ans:
  - A fair number, Ma.

- que:
  - Say your prayers?
  ans:
  - Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.

- que:
  - Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
  ans:
  - You were little Jesse James when you left.

- que:
  - Jesse, are you awake?
  ans:
  - Mmmm.

- que:
  - Jesse, is that your hand?
  ans:
  - Nuh-huh ...

- que:
  - You're sick of my company?
  ans:
  - No! I mean, of course not. No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.

- que:
  - So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
  ans:
  - Unfair. You are completely unfair.

- que:
  - You didn't want to farm?
  ans:
  - I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.

- que:
  - Thank God you grew out of that. You did grow out of that, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.

- que:
  - You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
  ans:
  - Not if I find the right girl.

- que:
  - And what's this right girl like?
  ans:
  - Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.

- que:
  - Where will you find such a girl?
  ans:
  - Little ones.

- que:
  - Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
  ans:
  - I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.

- que:
  - Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop?
  ans:
  - When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.

- que:
  - Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
  ans:
  - Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - \"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James.\" Only a dime in the hotel lobby.

- que:
  - Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
  ans:
  - Aw, shucks, ma'am...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - If you don't see it, it's not real...

- que:
  - Tennessee?
  ans:
  - I'll explain on the way.

- que:
  - So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
  ans:
  - That's the idea.

- que:
  - Did you order our houses burned down?
  ans:
  - Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.

- que:
  - Last February?
  ans:
  - Mmm.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.

- que:
  - Was it worth it?
  ans:
  - Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.

- que:
  - The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable. \"Jesse Woodson James.\" Jesse James? The Jesse James?
  ans:
  - Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.

- que:
  - Right here in church?
  ans:
  - Communion.

- que:
  - You okay, Jesse?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.

- que:
  - Jim, you been with a girl yet?
  ans:
  - Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.

- que:
  - Hell yeah! I been with... Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - It's his money. He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
  ans:
  - ... too young for whisky...

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I hope I'm not being too forward.

- que:
  - Thank you, Miss -- ?
  ans:
  - Lyla Devereux.

- que:
  - Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
  ans:
  - Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.

- que:
  - Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
  ans:
  - That is so gentlemanly of you.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - There's only four of them...

- que:
  - Your men knew the risks.
  ans:
  - How much did they get from the safe?

- que:
  - Parker.
  ans:
  - What is going on here, man?

- que:
  - What, sir?
  ans:
  - That.

- que:
  - Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
  ans:
  - Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.

- que:
  - You wouldn't have done that?
  ans:
  - Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.

- que:
  - So you can't tell me anything?
  ans:
  - It's going to be a long winter.

- que:
  - Can't you tell me anything?
  ans:
  - It's going to be a long spring.

- que:
  - Can you put men at all four?
  ans:
  - No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.

- que:
  - What the hell is that sound?
  ans:
  - Vengeance.

- que:
  - Listen, what are you doing tonight?
  ans:
  - What? Oh, I'm...busy.

- que:
  - Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
  ans:
  - Stop it. I'm...

- que:
  - On a lot of lithium?
  ans:
  - Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

- que:
  - Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
  ans:
  - Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

- que:
  - Courtney? Dinner?
  ans:
  - I can't.

- que:
  - Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
  ans:
  - A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.

- que:
  - Is that Donald Trump's car?
  ans:
  - Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

- que:
  - Are we here?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - This is Dorsia?
  ans:
  - Yes, dear.

- que:
  - Is it a what?
  ans:
  - It's a plain end. I think.

- que:
  - It's a plain end, see? So?
  ans:
  - Take it off.

- que:
  - Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
  ans:
  - Oh God, just get it over with.

- que:
  - Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What are you doing tonight?
  ans:
  - Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

- que:
  - You and...Luis?
  ans:
  - We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

- que:
  - Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
  ans:
  - You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
  ans:
  - I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception.

- que:
  - You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
  ans:
  - Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

- que:
  - So, you're looking great, how have you been?
  ans:
  - Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.

- que:
  - Is your Evian spiked?
  ans:
  - We should do it.

- que:
  - Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
  ans:
  - He's rich.

- que:
  - No. I'm not. Why should I ?
  ans:
  - Your hairline looks like it's receding.

- que:
  - Why? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.

- que:
  - Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
  ans:
  - I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

- que:
  - You're really serious, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am.

- que:
  - But what about the past? Our past?
  ans:
  - We never really shared one.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm just leaving.

- que:
  - But where?
  ans:
  - I have to return some videotapes.

- que:
  - That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
  ans:
  - What are the rules for a sweater vest?

- que:
  - Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Nice.

- que:
  - But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
  ans:
  - I know her. I knew her.

- que:
  - How did you guess?
  ans:
  - Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.

- que:
  - Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
  ans:
  - No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.

- que:
  - Are you my two o'clock?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

- que:
  - Doesn't he live here?
  ans:
  - No, he doesn't.

- que:
  - No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
  ans:
  - There was no ad in the Times.

- que:
  - Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, naturally.

- que:
  - What exactly do you mean?
  ans:
  - The message you left.

- que:
  - But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
  ans:
  - Carnes? Wait.

- que:
  - Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
  ans:
  - Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

- que:
  - It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
  ans:
  - It's just not.

- que:
  - Why not, you stupid bastard?
  ans:
  - Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.

- que:
  - No, you...didn't?
  ans:
  - Now, if you'll excuse me.

- que:
  - Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
  ans:
  - Lucky, I guess.

- que:
  - That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Patrick? Is that you?
  ans:
  - No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.

- que:
  - Patrick?
  ans:
  - What? CARRUTHERS I'll call you.

- que:
  - It looks that way, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - That's Paul Owen.

- que:
  - Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
  ans:
  - Maybe it's just the light.

- que:
  - I guess you're right... THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - New card. What do you think?
  ans:
  - I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

- que:
  - Leaving what?
  ans:
  - This.

- que:
  - Don't tell me...merchant banking?
  ans:
  - No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.

- que:
  - I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
  ans:
  - Dorsia.

- que:
  - Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
  ans:
  - Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

- que:
  - Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
  ans:
  - We are totally booked.

- que:
  - Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
  ans:
  - Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.

- que:
  - I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
  ans:
  - And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - After six.

- que:
  - Oh? And what should I say?
  ans:
  - Just...say...no.

- que:
  - Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Oh, something. . romantic?
  ans:
  - No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

- que:
  - No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
  ans:
  - You look nice today.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.

- que:
  - You don't like this, I take it?
  ans:
  - Come on, you're prettier than that.

- que:
  - Ye-es, Je-an?
  ans:
  - Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

- que:
  - Detective Donald KIMBALL?
  ans:
  - Tell him I'm at lunch.

- que:
  - Patrick?
  ans:
  - Can you bring Mr...

- que:
  - Yes, Patrick?
  ans:
  - Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

- que:
  - Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
  ans:
  - That is...if you're not doing anything.

- que:
  - Anywhere you want?
  ans:
  - Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.

- que:
  - Jean? Sorbet?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

- que:
  - Want a bite?
  ans:
  - I'm on a diet. But thank you.

- que:
  - Do you have a boyfriend?
  ans:
  - No, not really.

- que:
  - Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
  ans:
  - Growing. I'm glad you said that.

- que:
  - Who's Ted Bundy?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.

- que:
  - Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
  ans:
  - What...No! Put it in the carton.

- que:
  - Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

- que:
  - If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?
  ans:
  - No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.

- que:
  - Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
  ans:
  - Jean? Hello? Jean?

- que:
  - Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
  ans:
  - Patrick? I can't hear you.

- que:
  - Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

- que:
  - A model? An actor?
  ans:
  - No. Flattering, but no.

- que:
  - Welt...it depends, why?
  ans:
  - Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

- que:
  - Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
  ans:
  - Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

- que:
  - Next Saturday?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Uh huh?
  ans:
  - She's from...France.

- que:
  - You're at Paul Owen s.
  ans:
  - Why would I?

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Paul Owen.

- que:
  - Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
  ans:
  - Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

- que:
  - No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
  ans:
  - Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

- que:
  - No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?
  ans:
  - Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.

- que:
  - So, what's the topic of discussion?
  ans:
  - I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.

- que:
  - You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
  ans:
  - No. I'm okay.

- que:
  - Perrier? San Pellegrino?
  ans:
  - The disappearance of Paul Owen.

- que:
  - Understandable. Lime?
  ans:
  - No, really. I'm okay.

- que:
  - Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
  ans:
  - Shoot.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

- que:
  - Where did you go to school?
  ans:
  - Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

- que:
  - Your address?
  ans:
  - Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.

- que:
  - Who do you ask?
  ans:
  - You seem...nervous.

- que:
  - Would you rather I not smoke?
  ans:
  - No, I guess it's okay.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - No problem.

- que:
  - What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - How well did you know him?
  ans:
  - I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.

- que:
  - Yale thing?
  ans:
  - Yeah...Yale thing.

- que:
  - So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
  ans:
  - He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.

- que:
  - Do you feel that way?
  ans:
  - No. Not really.

- que:
  - Hang...out?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You know...hang out.

- que:
  - He had a yacht?
  ans:
  - No, he just hung out there.

- que:
  - Don't you know this?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.

- que:
  - Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
  ans:
  - We were both seven in 1969.

- que:
  - Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
  ans:
  - Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.

- que:
  - Well, maybe he did, huh?
  ans:
  - His girlfriend doesn't think so.

- que:
  - But...has anyone seen him in London?
  ans:
  - Actually, yes.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
  ans:
  - Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?

- que:
  - Have you consulted a psychic?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Had his apartment been burglarized?
  ans:
  - No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

- que:
  - I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
  ans:
  - No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.

- que:
  - That's so typical, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...

- que:
  - Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
  ans:
  - Uh, no. There's one...down here.

- que:
  - So...you hang out here a lot?
  ans:
  - Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

- que:
  - Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I mean they want to get caught.

- que:
  - Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December?
  ans:
  - God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's not the information I've received.

- que:
  - Well, I could he wrong.
  ans:
  - Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?

- que:
  - Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
  ans:
  - Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

- que:
  - Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
  ans:
  - Great, yes, I'd like that.

- que:
  - Not a big music fan, eh?
  ans:
  - No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.

- que:
  - No hash browns?
  ans:
  - Not in the mood, I guess.

- que:
  - But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.

- que:
  - I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
  ans:
  - I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

- que:
  - But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
  ans:
  - According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I've questioned him.

- que:
  - Marcus?
  ans:
  - Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.

- que:
  - But Marcus denied it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - He does? You're sure?
  ans:
  - I checked it out. It's clean.

- que:
  - Where was Marcus?
  ans:
  - He wasn't with Paul Owen.

- que:
  - So who was he with?
  ans:
  - He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and  - you.

- que:
  - It's cold out, too, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I'm so hungry.

- que:
  - Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
  ans:
  - I lost my job...

- que:
  - Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
  ans:
  - Gee, uh, that's too bad.

- que:
  - Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
  ans:
  - I'm not...

- que:
  - I'm hungry.
  ans:
  - You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

- que:
  - Listen, what's your name?
  ans:
  - Al.

- que:
  - How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
  ans:
  - It's...it's...all right.

- que:
  - Really? That's interesting. Not great?
  ans:
  - Oh well, you know.

- que:
  - So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
  ans:
  - I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.

- que:
  - Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
  ans:
  - And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

- que:
  - Another Martini, Paul?
  ans:
  - Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

- que:
  - Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
  ans:
  - No, man. I'm gonna bail.

- que:
  - Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
  ans:
  - No, Owen.

- que:
  - Is that a raincoat?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

- que:
  - How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
  ans:
  - What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.

- que:
  - Is it over?
  ans:
  - They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.

- que:
  - \"Make\" him?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean.

- que:
  - You don't wanna move, do you?
  ans:
  - I can paint anywhere.

- que:
  - But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
  ans:
  - I think that's great, Milo. I do.

- que:
  - Didn't you visit the campus?
  ans:
  - You saved my life in alot of ways.

- que:
  - We're not gonna let it.
  ans:
  - When's Brian coming for the TV?

- que:
  - To our new life. ...What's wrong?
  ans:
  - That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me.

- que:
  - What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. 'Not saying it makes sense.

- que:
  - Isn't that -- extreme?
  ans:
  - What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.

- que:
  - What're you -- what?
  ans:
  - It was a hate crime.

- que:
  - They hack into people's programs?
  ans:
  - It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.

- que:
  - You can't just walk in, either.
  ans:
  - You think I don't know that?

- que:
  - Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
  ans:
  - I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.

- que:
  - It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Nothing?
  ans:
  - It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.

- que:
  - I remember.
  ans:
  - ...Why?

- que:
  - Guilt?
  ans:
  - If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.

- que:
  - ...Different?
  ans:
  - Where were you? You know you can't keep anything from me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.

- que:
  - ...What?
  ans:
  - I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.

- que:
  - Don't we have any chopsticks?
  ans:
  - Oh, right. Hold on.

- que:
  - Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
  ans:
  - He'll tell me when he gets home.

- que:
  - That'll be a test, won't it?
  ans:
  - Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.

- que:
  - He wasn't acting?
  ans:
  - I don't think he knows how.

- que:
  - Right... What's that mean again?
  ans:
  - It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...

- que:
  - ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. I need to talk to you.

- que:
  - Milo?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

- que:
  - Milo?
  ans:
  - My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.

- que:
  - It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
  ans:
  - If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.

- que:
  - And Outpost? You're happy there?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - You're living here?
  ans:
  - Sure, I'll see what I can do.

- que:
  - Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
  ans:
  - Forgot to introduce you. I have a girlfriend.

- que:
  - Will I get to work for Outpost?
  ans:
  - No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.

- que:
  - What'd they ever do for you?
  ans:
  - You're interfaced with our dish.

- que:
  - ...When did you know?
  ans:
  - You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.

- que:
  - That's gotta kill him, right?
  ans:
  - Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.

- que:
  - Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
  ans:
  - Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.

- que:
  - Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
  ans:
  - He's pretty tight with his family.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - I think they call him the \"Houseman.\" 'Cause \"guard\" sounds too weird.

- que:
  - ...Hello?
  ans:
  - Oh. No thanks.

- que:
  - Okay. I'm Gary.
  ans:
  - It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?

- que:
  - ...Do I?
  ans:
  - Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.

- que:
  - How's it going?
  ans:
  - Maybe I'm going too fast.

- que:
  - You did this -- overnight?
  ans:
  - You're making me young again.

- que:
  - Milo. What's up?
  ans:
  - Well -- you sent for me.

- que:
  - You really wrote this just today?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - It scales, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Definitely.

- que:
  - Had you talked to him much lately?
  ans:
  - Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.

- que:
  - Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me, it's in the wrong place.
  ans:
  - Did you?

- que:
  - The wrong place?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
  ans:
  - No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.

- que:
  - ...Worse?
  ans:
  - Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.

- que:
  - This is good. Who did it?
  ans:
  - Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.

- que:
  - What'd the girl say?
  ans:
  - Let's go.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to 12.

- que:
  - Gary?
  ans:
  - Just do it.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - I mean, it's your life.

- que:
  - ...You wanna work -- here?
  ans:
  - Got out of my other commitment.

- que:
  - You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
  ans:
  - Cool.

- que:
  - Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
  ans:
  - Every entry was authorized.

- que:
  - What're we looking for?
  ans:
  - Any irregularity in the pattern.

- que:
  - Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. What would Milo want in here, anyway?
  ans:
  - They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.

- que:
  - You calling Phil and Randy?
  ans:
  - I'm calling Gary.

- que:
  - I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
  ans:
  - Where we going?

- que:
  - ...Were you?
  ans:
  - We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.

- que:
  - Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
  ans:
  - ...Something like that. Yeah.

- que:
  - What've you got there?
  ans:
  - No. Please.

- que:
  - \"There is no second place.\" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. Is it like that with your counselor?
  ans:
  - Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.

- que:
  - Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
  ans:
  - Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - Long story. Not that interesting.

- que:
  - So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
  ans:
  - Then and now. But not right now.

- que:
  - But why would they --?
  ans:
  - I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. I know what he did to you.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Is that my -- scenario? Tell me.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.

- que:
  - What about the FBI?
  ans:
  - They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.

- que:
  - Who can we trust?
  ans:
  - There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.

- que:
  - Do we post it on the Net?
  ans:
  - He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.

- que:
  - But they'd still get the idea, right?
  ans:
  - It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.

- que:
  - And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
  ans:
  - You mean -- break in?

- que:
  - Why were you snooping in my office?
  ans:
  - Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out.

- que:
  - Cause their apartments might be bugged?
  ans:
  - I told Teddy about you.

- que:
  - He doesn't know about the Day Care.
  ans:
  - What'd he say?

- que:
  - Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
  ans:
  - Same with the excerpts I'm choosing, they'll play against any of the images you described.

- que:
  - That's lame, isn't it?
  ans:
  - You'll come up with something.

- que:
  - Does he know you know?
  ans:
  - Why?!

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to 12.

- que:
  - ...You got my E-mail?
  ans:
  - And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.

- que:
  - Is that how Larry feels?
  ans:
  - Uh. Not exactly.

- que:
  - I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo?
  ans:
  - I met this girl.

- que:
  - What? Come on. Is it serious?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What d'you mean?
  ans:
  - I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.

- que:
  - So -- how far are we from the campus?
  ans:
  - Oh we're not going to the campus.

- que:
  - So how'd you like the house?
  ans:
  - His Snapples were in alphabetical order.

- que:
  - She's a programmer?
  ans:
  - Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. You'll be working with her.

- que:
  - I've got a girlfriend, remember?
  ans:
  - Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.

- que:
  - What're they building?
  ans:
  - Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.

- que:
  - Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
  ans:
  - There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.

- que:
  - Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
  ans:
  - Damn. 'Have to go back over there. Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - We're too late. Take a look.

- que:
  - We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
  ans:
  - You seem surprised to see me.

- que:
  - Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please?
  ans:
  - You may.

- que:
  - Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
  ans:
  - I didn't, baby, you just told me.

- que:
  - May I wash you?
  ans:
  - Groovy.

- que:
  - How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
  ans:
  - Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.

- que:
  - Is it about my teeth?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.

- que:
  - Hey, how are you?
  ans:
  - Hungry.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.

- que:
  - WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
  ans:
  - The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.

- que:
  - Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
  ans:
  - A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.

- que:
  - Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
  ans:
  - Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.

- que:
  - You mean Mrs. Kensington?
  ans:
  - No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Be careful.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Be careful.

- que:
  - Where is Vanessa, by the way?
  ans:
  - She's working on another lead right now.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Be careful.

- que:
  - What's the other thing you're scared of?
  ans:
  - Carnies.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.

- que:
  - I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
  ans:
  - My God, Austin, what have you done?

- que:
  - Yes, Basil?
  ans:
  - Well, you can't always get what you want.

- que:
  - Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
  ans:
  - That does not compute.

- que:
  - What's wrong with your hand?
  ans:
  - Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

- que:
  - Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
  ans:
  - I've got you, Dr. Evil!

- que:
  - If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me. God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
  ans:
  - My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - My wedding tackle.

- que:
  - I'm sorry?
  ans:
  - My meat and two veg.

- que:
  - A Chigro?
  ans:
  - You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro.

- que:
  - Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
  ans:
  - I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.

- que:
  - Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
  ans:
  - Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me! Honestly, this isn't mine.

- que:
  - Do you want to talk to him?
  ans:
  - Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I never forget a pussy... cat.

- que:
  - Fancy a nibble?
  ans:
  - I couldn't have another bite.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

- que:
  - Austin, may I have a word with you?
  ans:
  - Of course, luv.

- que:
  - I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
  ans:
  - Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.

- que:
  - No, did you use a condom?
  ans:
  - Only sailors use condoms, man.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - You know who.

- que:
  - Does that make you horny?
  ans:
  - Not now, Austin.

- que:
  - First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
  ans:
  - Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.

- que:
  - What do we do now?
  ans:
  - Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.

- que:
  - Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
  ans:
  - Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.

- que:
  - What are you saying, son?
  ans:
  - It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.

- que:
  - What's its current position?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
  ans:
  - My son?

- que:
  - Dr. Evil?
  ans:
  - Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.

- que:
  - Really? Are they ill-tempered?
  ans:
  - Please allow me to demonstrate.

- que:
  - That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
  ans:
  - Not me.

- que:
  - An evil vet?
  ans:
  - No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.

- que:
  - An evil petting zoo?
  ans:
  - You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.

- que:
  - Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
  ans:
  - Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.

- que:
  - Yeah. What?
  ans:
  - Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.

- que:
  - Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
  ans:
  - In due time.

- que:
  - But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.

- que:
  - Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
  ans:
  - I don't want to.

- que:
  - Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
  ans:
  - Blow me.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Show me.

- que:
  - Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - How's Austin?
  ans:
  - He's asleep.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.

- que:
  - What about his teeth?
  ans:
  - You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

- que:
  - Did you ever want to?
  ans:
  - You didn't answer my question, Mum.

- que:
  - So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
  ans:
  - Well, it's kind of weird.

- que:
  - And how do you feel about that?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna take over the family business.

- que:
  - What do you want to do, Scott?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.

- que:
  - Seriously?
  ans:
  - Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.

- que:
  - You don't say. How real does it feel?
  ans:
  - As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.

- que:
  - There are limits?
  ans:
  - The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.

- que:
  - How long have I been here?
  ans:
  - Three days.

- que:
  - I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
  ans:
  - Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

- que:
  - Sir August...? What now?
  ans:
  - May I help you, madam ...

- que:
  - You are female?
  ans:
  - As you see.

- que:
  - People, too.
  ans:
  - Really -- what happened in 1922?

- que:
  - Then who wins?
  ans:
  - How curious ...

- que:
  - Ropes?
  ans:
  - He tried to warn us ...

- que:
  - Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
  ans:
  - Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.

- que:
  - The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
  ans:
  - What are you trying to do to me?

- que:
  - To you ... ?
  ans:
  - The Institute ... the funding ...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

- que:
  - This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To find out who killed my husband.

- que:
  - Next assignment?
  ans:
  - Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...

- que:
  - But -- why?
  ans:
  - You disappoint me, Emma. Can't you guess? For you. It was all for you ...

- que:
  - Ring?
  ans:
  - Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.

- que:
  - Then what's stopping you?
  ans:
  - Speaking of Peter, there's more good news, You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

- que:
  - Choices?
  ans:
  - I'll never marry you.

- que:
  - Doctor Peel, I presume?
  ans:
  - Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.

- que:
  - I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
  ans:
  - Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.

- que:
  - And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
  ans:
  - I didn't. Mother did.

- que:
  - Mother?
  ans:
  - ... Showers followed by sunny periods.

- que:
  - A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
  ans:
  - You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

- que:
  - You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
  ans:
  - Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.

- que:
  - But why? What's the point?
  ans:
  - A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.

- que:
  - Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
  ans:
  - As per mother's instructions.

- que:
  - Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
  ans:
  - They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

- que:
  - After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - An eccentric recluse?
  ans:
  - Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

- que:
  - June, July ... August?
  ans:
  - The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.

- que:
  - So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
  ans:
  - Small talk. Try the weather.

- que:
  - You should be dead. How do you feel?
  ans:
  - Strange.

- que:
  - Why should they think that?
  ans:
  - You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.

- que:
  - Did he say who?
  ans:
  - No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.

- que:
  - An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
  ans:
  - Did you say formal? I must dress.

- que:
  - Either way ... may I ask, why you dress in that fashion?
  ans:
  - I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning.

- que:
  - How on earth can you tell?
  ans:
  - Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...

- que:
  - Any ideas?
  ans:
  - Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...

- que:
  - Is that written in his shoe?
  ans:
  - Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

- que:
  - Not quite. This is my field.
  ans:
  - Thanks ... I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?

- que:
  - Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
  ans:
  - But if someone miniaturized the process...

- que:
  - Is that what you think?
  ans:
  - Oh, well ... Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

- que:
  - Do you always drive this fast?
  ans:
  - Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...

- que:
  - What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
  ans:
  - Barely.

- que:
  - You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
  ans:
  - The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...

- que:
  - Was I?
  ans:
  - I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...

- que:
  - To kill me?
  ans:
  - Nothing personal.

- que:
  - Yes ... ?
  ans:
  - ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

- que:
  - And do you trust me?
  ans:
  - I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

- que:
  - Is that all?
  ans:
  - But you did suspect me.

- que:
  - Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
  ans:
  - I thought you played by the rules.

- que:
  - You don't trust me?
  ans:
  - As far as you trust me.

- que:
  - Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
  ans:
  - No idea who. No idea why ...

- que:
  - Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
  ans:
  - Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.

- que:
  - Why's he called 'Invisible'?
  ans:
  - You'll find out.

- que:
  - Aren't you coming?
  ans:
  - There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

- que:
  - What's that you're wearing?
  ans:
  - It's called Black Leather.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.

- que:
  - Trubshaw again? What now?
  ans:
  - Snuff. I must insist you try some.

- que:
  - Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
  ans:
  - Have a look at this.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - The plot. Hello, we must be going ...

- que:
  - Have you any place in mind?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact I have ...

- que:
  - Our little paradise -- just made for two?
  ans:
  - Not quite.

- que:
  - Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
  ans:
  - Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...

- que:
  - I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
  ans:
  - Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

- que:
  - Where's Mother?
  ans:
  - Mobile HQ. In a blue funk. Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...

- que:
  - You don't believe him?
  ans:
  - It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated. Wait here.

- que:
  - Decontamination -- ?
  ans:
  - And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive. He tells me you're very beautiful.

- que:
  - Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
  ans:
  - Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch, Valentine Peel.

- que:
  - Surveillance? By whom?
  ans:
  - Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.

- que:
  - Well, I can't possibly go like this.
  ans:
  - Getting to what?

- que:
  - ... and now?
  ans:
  - Privately owned by ...

- que:
  - I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
  ans:
  - A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...

- que:
  - Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
  ans:
  - She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.

- que:
  - Amnesia?
  ans:
  - Possibly. Split personality ...

- que:
  - Insane ... ?
  ans:
  - Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - She may try to kill you.

- que:
  - Anyone particular in mind?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - This man -- did you see him?
  ans:
  - No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.

- que:
  - You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
  ans:
  - Mother and Father know best.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In your operation.

- que:
  - Are you alright, young man?
  ans:
  - I think so, thank you so much ...

- que:
  - I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
  ans:
  - She was ...

- que:
  - You with Mother or Father?
  ans:
  - Both, actually.

- que:
  - Mrs. Peel -- ?
  ans:
  - Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...

- que:
  - But did they teach you this?
  ans:
  - Bang-bang ... you're dead.

- que:
  - Aren't you forgetting about something?
  ans:
  - Ugh ...

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - Debbie's marrying Rick.

- que:
  - Does Cole know about this?
  ans:
  - Really -- you went with him for two years.

- que:
  - Bobbie, what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.

- que:
  - What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
  ans:
  - They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.

- que:
  - I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
  ans:
  - Rick's got an important announcement to make.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're going for a little liquid refreshment.

- que:
  - Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.

- que:
  - When do the girls get to the party?
  ans:
  - Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.

- que:
  - Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
  ans:
  - I want Debbie.

- que:
  - What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
  ans:
  - Five thousand dollars.

- que:
  - What is this person's story here?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Dad. Cole, go away.

- que:
  - The car for Debbie?
  ans:
  - I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.

- que:
  - Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
  ans:
  - Low mileage... Handles like a dream.

- que:
  - Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
  ans:
  - You've had it. I'm gonna get you.

- que:
  - Fan out and look for them.
  ans:
  - Cole, what the hell are you doing?

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Mr. Thomerson.

- que:
  - Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
  ans:
  - Yes I did.

- que:
  - Fine. How's everything going?
  ans:
  - Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...

- que:
  - Hi, everybody. Am I late?
  ans:
  - Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.

- que:
  - So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
  ans:
  - Sure have...

- que:
  - But how can I do that?
  ans:
  - If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action.

- que:
  - So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
  ans:
  - What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.

- que:
  - Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
  ans:
  - The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...

- que:
  - Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
  ans:
  - 1002.

- que:
  - Cole?
  ans:
  - Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.

- que:
  - Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
  ans:
  - No, Cole, I...

- que:
  - You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
  ans:
  - I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.

- que:
  - What are we having?
  ans:
  - It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.

- que:
  - Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think?
  ans:
  - It looks awful.

- que:
  - Are you going to have women at your party?
  ans:
  - No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.

- que:
  - Oh, those. Why do you ask?
  ans:
  - Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I just feel scared.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.

- que:
  - Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
  ans:
  - C'mere.

- que:
  - Can't I just go with you guys?
  ans:
  - Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.

- que:
  - Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
  ans:
  - Let's get naked.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
  ans:
  - You're so romantic...

- que:
  - Are you sure this is a good idea?
  ans:
  - Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

- que:
  - Why is Cole here?
  ans:
  - You know your father enjoys his company.

- que:
  - Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
  ans:
  - A real turd.

- que:
  - What are you talking about, asshole?
  ans:
  - Your whores never showed up.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.

- que:
  - Because I love her. What can I tell you?
  ans:
  - Let's have a toast.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - It's true.

- que:
  - Hookers beat you up?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
  ans:
  - Rick, I really think I'm in love.

- que:
  - You're a pimp?
  ans:
  - I'm telling you I am, Joe.

- que:
  - So, Larry, how have you been?
  ans:
  - Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.

- que:
  - Larry, you and your wife got problems?
  ans:
  - I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.

- que:
  - Is that all the coke in the place?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - You want to share it?
  ans:
  - Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.

- que:
  - What do you mean, it changes?
  ans:
  - Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I guess so.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to slash my wrists.

- que:
  - You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
  ans:
  - I couldn't find any razor blades.

- que:
  - This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
  ans:
  - Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.

- que:
  - Can't I just maim it a little?
  ans:
  - Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.

- que:
  - Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
  ans:
  - In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.

- que:
  - How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
  ans:
  - Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.

- que:
  - Mrs.?
  ans:
  - I'm separated.

- que:
  - I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Where'd she go?
  ans:
  - She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.

- que:
  - Where the hell is he?
  ans:
  - Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.

- que:
  - We'll spend an hour with \"Nymphos Without Pants\"...
  ans:
  - What's the matter?

- que:
  - Olivier's in that, right?
  ans:
  - Then it's on to the real thing.

- que:
  - Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
  ans:
  - Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - My gift to you.

- que:
  - I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Got me.

- que:
  - How 'bout this?
  ans:
  - Still drawing a blank.

- que:
  - He look familiar?
  ans:
  - Very.

- que:
  - Who's your friend?
  ans:
  - How about this, a Trojan donkey.

- que:
  - What are you going to do about it?
  ans:
  - What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Debbie.

- que:
  - What's with her costume?
  ans:
  - I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.

- que:
  - Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
  ans:
  - That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.

- que:
  - Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.

- que:
  - Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
  ans:
  - FRANCIS You're late again, Rick.

- que:
  - How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Can you believe how perfect it fits?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.

- que:
  - Wash it to the windows?
  ans:
  - No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.

- que:
  - You know Knowlton pretty well?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
  ans:
  - There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.

- que:
  - It doesn't go like that.
  ans:
  - Did you do it for Tim?

- que:
  - Who asked you?
  ans:
  - If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.

- que:
  - Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
  ans:
  - I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.

- que:
  - So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
  ans:
  - Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.

- que:
  - Been ripping off fire stations?
  ans:
  - It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.

- que:
  - What, you've never seen one before?
  ans:
  - In the Field Museum once.

- que:
  - People actually used to pay you for this?
  ans:
  - Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.

- que:
  - Why'd you come here, Brian?
  ans:
  - Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.

- que:
  - Ya love it, probie?
  ans:
  - I'm in heaven, Lt.

- que:
  - Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
  ans:
  - Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.

- que:
  - This?
  ans:
  - Yeah... too bright...

- que:
  - What, are you kidding? By myself?
  ans:
  - What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.

- que:
  - You got a problem with drilling, probie?
  ans:
  - No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I waited... I would have fucking waited...

- que:
  - You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today? What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
  ans:
  - ...Not now, Brian.

- que:
  - Fuck you.
  ans:
  - I had that fire. He didn't listen!

- que:
  - Hey, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Just... Just wanted to say hello...

- que:
  - You're selling dad's boat?
  ans:
  - Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...

- que:
  - Saw what?
  ans:
  - When dad died, I saw another fire...

- que:
  - Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Brian... I don't know...

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.

- que:
  - -- What were they doing there?
  ans:
  - They were for the fucking boat, Brian.

- que:
  - What are we going to do about this?
  ans:
  - I'll handle it.

- que:
  - Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
  ans:
  - You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?

- que:
  - Yeah? What have you been up to?
  ans:
  - I work for city hall.

- que:
  - With grenadine, right?
  ans:
  - When I was twenty.

- que:
  - Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
  ans:
  - Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.

- que:
  - -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
  ans:
  - Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?

- que:
  - Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
  ans:
  - What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.

- que:
  - So now you suddenly care about my future?
  ans:
  - I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.

- que:
  - How's it going?
  ans:
  - Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.

- que:
  - Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?
  ans:
  - If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...

- que:
  - You think that's really any of your business?
  ans:
  - Well, you did invite me here.

- que:
  - Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
  ans:
  - No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.

- que:
  - Got anything to drink in there?
  ans:
  - Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.

- que:
  - This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Homey.

- que:
  - Then why did you quit?
  ans:
  - I wanted to be a good one.

- que:
  - Brian. What's wrong?
  ans:
  - You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.

- que:
  - You could check. It'd be in his files.
  ans:
  - Yeah? And just how much of all this has been \"doing your job\"?

- que:
  - Do you know what you're asking me to do?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What'll you do?
  ans:
  - I don't have the slightest idea...

- que:
  - I'll see ya around, huh?
  ans:
  - It's a small town.

- que:
  - Hey, do I know you?
  ans:
  - I'm close... but I can't get who it is...

- que:
  - Sure you do.
  ans:
  - Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?

- que:
  - Trychticholorate.
  ans:
  - Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?

- que:
  - Who the fuck is doing this?
  ans:
  - After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...

- que:
  - Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
  ans:
  - If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.

- que:
  - You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
  ans:
  - I want another shot, Sir.

- que:
  - Your Dennis' kid. I work alone.
  ans:
  - If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --

- que:
  - Are you still here?
  ans:
  - Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Pest control.

- que:
  - Glass?
  ans:
  - Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - But he killed these guys.

- que:
  - That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
  ans:
  - No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.

- que:
  - Are you going public with this?
  ans:
  - No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.

- que:
  - In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
  ans:
  - Fire.

- que:
  - It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
  ans:
  - Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...

- que:
  - Did you pull me out?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Did I say thanks?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So what do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Your brother was a good man.

- que:
  - Brian?
  ans:
  - Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

- que:
  - Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
  ans:
  - Four months.

- que:
  - Four months?
  ans:
  - I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.

- que:
  - Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
  ans:
  - Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.

- que:
  - Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
  ans:
  - Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

- que:
  - Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
  ans:
  - Completely out of control.

- que:
  - Engine 115, right?
  ans:
  - How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.

- que:
  - Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
  ans:
  - Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.

- que:
  - So, you surviving without me?
  ans:
  - There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.

- que:
  - Uh huh. And \"Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins\". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Management were pin heads.

- que:
  - \"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards\"?
  ans:
  - Coffee sucked.

- que:
  - Who's going to die?
  ans:
  - We gotta roll, Stevie...

- que:
  - Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
  ans:
  - You can't talk about my brother like that...

- que:
  - Stephen, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Fixing my roof.

- que:
  - Where's Sean?
  ans:
  - He's got piano lessons.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? How's he doing?
  ans:
  - He's going to be a fireman.

- que:
  - He treats you okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - You want some coffee?
  ans:
  - Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing?
  ans:
  - He's out.

- que:
  - I know he's out, but how's he doing?
  ans:
  - Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.

- que:
  - Yeah? When was the last time?
  ans:
  - You can't keep being his father...

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.

- que:
  - Putty? On both doors?
  ans:
  - There's something else kinda interesting...

- que:
  - What the hell was it doing in the fire?
  ans:
  - That's your job.

- que:
  - How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
  ans:
  - Didn't think you'd make it.

- que:
  - Who's this?
  ans:
  - He works for me.

- que:
  - Did he tell you how we finally met?
  ans:
  - Nobody cares, Ronald.

- que:
  - And old ladies?
  ans:
  - -- Burn them.

- que:
  - Got a cause?
  ans:
  - Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.

- que:
  - What do you listen to, Stephen?
  ans:
  - You don't know... nobody knows...

- que:
  - Don't you have any leads at all?
  ans:
  - No Marty, I don't.

- que:
  - Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
  ans:
  - Just catch the son of a bitch.

- que:
  - Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
  ans:
  - Investigator...

- que:
  - What's to believe?
  ans:
  - That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.

- que:
  - You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

  - WOMAN Are you all right, honey?
  ans:
  - I was gonna bring it back myself.

  - So what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - WOMAN He wants to know who brought in the chalice.

  - What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
  ans:
  - The rich kind. Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.

  ans:

  ans:
  - Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

- que:

  ans:
  - I forgive you.

- que:
  - Large?
  ans:
  - All right, cop. I want my money.

- que:
  - What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
  ans:
  - Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.

- que:
  - Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
  ans:
  - Yeah, sucker. You better be there!

- que:
  - All right. What are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - I want 15 on the Mets.

  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm sure.

- que:
  - OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.

- que:
  - That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
  ans:
  - Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?

- que:
  - What money?
  ans:
  - I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.

- que:
  - The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.

- que:
  - You knew them? Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
  ans:
  - Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.

- que:
  - Ho!
  ans:
  - ...that simpleton is holding back the race. They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

- que:
  - I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me. Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
  ans:
  - My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different. Can you do this for me?

- que:
  - Well you did.
  ans:
  - C'mon. It's easy. It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word. Everybody go it?

- que:
  - Give me some?
  ans:
  - I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street. You must be crazy, Julius.

- que:
  - Who are you revolting against?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours. What's his name again?
  ans:
  - Delacroix.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - My righteous name is BIG BLACK.

- que:
  - And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
  ans:
  - We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding. The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists. We drop science.

- que:
  - What do you do?
  ans:
  - I'm a revolutionary.

- que:
  - Why are you smiling so?
  ans:
  - I'm not smiling.

- que:
  - Certified ladies' man, huh?
  ans:
  - She's also moorish.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Moorish. Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.

- que:
  - What's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - Must be the pressure.

- que:
  - Why they gotta make my nose so big?
  ans:
  - Look at my lips.

- que:
  - What are you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - Jim Jones, y'know. I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - I'm out.

- que:
  - So that's what you been doing?
  ans:
  - Damn skippy.

- que:
  - Y'know what I mean. Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
  ans:
  - Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.

- que:
  - You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
  ans:
  - No offense.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - First things first. I have to know if Manray is up for this.

- que:
  - What kind of show is this gonna be?
  ans:
  - Different.

- que:
  - What about in the mean time? Not the in between time?
  ans:
  - You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.

- que:
  - Did we get our bill yet?
  ans:
  - Ahh, the luxuries of life.

- que:
  - Are you crazy? The joint is crawling with cops now. You wanna go to Rikers? Go to the hoosegow?
  ans:
  - We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.

- que:
  - If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
  ans:
  - Some tap dancing, some singing.

- que:
  - How different?
  ans:
  - Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.

- que:
  - To what?
  ans:
  - You're now Mantan.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You have to start getting into your character.

- que:
  - I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
  ans:
  - Mantan?

- que:
  - How you sound?
  ans:
  - I won't do it anymore.

- que:
  - Yes. And I say yes because who is to judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? Who? Who can play God?
  ans:
  - But the line has to be drawn.

- que:
  - Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
  ans:
  - Can I finish? Thank you. I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.

- que:
  - Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
  ans:
  - I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...

- que:
  - So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
  ans:
  - I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.

- que:
  - Do you know what C.P. Time is?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.

- que:
  - So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
  ans:
  - Word!!!

- que:
  - The name of the show?
  ans:
  - It is called, MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

- que:
  - Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or dance?
  ans:
  - I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.

- que:
  - Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose? Which one is Mantan again?
  ans:
  - That's a great handle.

- que:
  - What are there character traits?
  ans:
  - Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.

- que:
  - And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
  ans:
  - Yep, you guessed it.

- que:
  - Who are the other characters?
  ans:
  - Do we have characters? How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.

- que:
  - I don't know about that plantation angle.
  ans:
  - We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting?

- que:
  - We think so.
  ans:
  - What are you talkin' 'bout? It's the move. Stay wid me now. We're movin' fast. What does everybody else think about this?

- que:
  - Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
  ans:
  - I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

- que:
  - You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
  ans:
  - I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.

- que:
  - What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
  ans:
  - If Spielburg can direct \"The Color Purple\" and \"Amistad\", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.

- que:
  - That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in anything?
  ans:
  - No!!! Just meet the guy. That's all I'm asking. Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director. You can have that.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to speak with you.

- que:
  - How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm askin'.

- que:
  - Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
  ans:
  - All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the \"life's too short\" category.

- que:
  - Enough about me, what's happening with you?
  ans:
  - The same old, same old. Trying to get my stuff through.

- que:
  - Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
  ans:
  - Nuthin' I can't handle.

- que:
  - Where do you go from here?
  ans:
  - Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.

- que:
  - How long has my father been like this?
  ans:
  - Not that often. He was excited to see you.

- que:
  - So he drank himself into a stuper?
  ans:
  - The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

- que:
  - So what's up with you?
  ans:
  - Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
  ans:
  - Nobody told me anything.

- que:
  - What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
  ans:
  - It hit me like a ton of bricks.

- que:
  - The idea was out there in the universe. Now what?
  ans:
  - Manray was under our nose the whole time.

- que:
  - Do you know how you will use him?
  ans:
  - Not yet, but this thing will never get made.

- que:
  - What point is that?
  ans:
  - The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.

- que:
  - You getting cold feet?
  ans:
  - I'm in till the end.

- que:
  - Can't you just quit? Walk away?
  ans:
  - And lose out on my money? The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.

- que:
  - What is your problem?
  ans:
  - My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

- que:
  - What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.

- que:
  - Which one is your brother?
  ans:
  - The big one.

- que:
  - What do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - Just don't lie to me.

- que:
  - Who's side are you on?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's too funny.

- que:
  - So you have your small victory, now what?
  ans:
  - A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - A gift.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.

- que:
  - Is that good or bad?
  ans:
  - It's all good. You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank. Plus, I love these old black collectibles.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.

- que:
  - Why'd you do that?
  ans:
  - I don't want to hear it.

- que:
  - How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
  ans:
  - You're the one that put us together. We're friends.

- que:
  - Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan?
  ans:
  - Please don't go there.

- que:
  - Do you have to be so damn forthright?
  ans:
  - DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.

- que:
  - Light?
  ans:
  - That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.

- que:
  - Work related or otherwise?
  ans:
  - Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.

- que:
  - Yes, your name?
  ans:
  - He, I'm Mona.

- que:
  - Oh, is that what I'm doing?
  ans:
  - David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud.

- que:
  - That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
  ans:
  - The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.

- que:
  - Can I kiss you too?
  ans:
  - Naw. I'll take the zero.

- que:
  - You feel good, not nervous?
  ans:
  - I feel fine.

- que:
  - Not nervous? Relaxed?
  ans:
  - Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.

- que:
  - What are you? A man or a mouse? Are you a punk? Punking out on me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
  ans:
  - Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.

- que:
  - You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost. Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How's the food?
  ans:
  - Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.

- que:
  - That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
  ans:
  - It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show.

- que:
  - To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
  ans:
  - Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.

- que:
  - He said that?
  ans:
  - Yes he did.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.

- que:
  - You going to attack me too. The show is a hit. Aren't you happy for me?
  ans:
  - Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.

- que:
  - Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Not at all?
  ans:
  - You know how your Daddy is.

- que:
  - I won't forget. When are you coming up here to see your mother?
  ans:
  - Soon.

- que:
  - Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
  ans:
  - I just turned twenty.

- que:
  - Where are you from?
  ans:
  - Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.

- que:
  - Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
  ans:
  - Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES. I'M A NEGRO.

- que:
  - My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
  ans:
  - This is a TV show, not a music video.

- que:
  - Then will you teach me what I need to know. Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
  ans:
  - This is a travesty. A debacle.

- que:
  - You've never had any formal training, either?
  ans:
  - Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.

- que:
  - You sing and dance?
  ans:
  - A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.

- que:
  - Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
  ans:
  - This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.

- que:
  - No mo' \"city slickers.\" Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
  ans:
  - EAT The one with da big...

- que:
  - EAT Too bad. How 'bout a dress?
  ans:
  - Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...

- que:
  - EAT So when are you comin' to pick us up?
  ans:
  - Around...

- que:
  - EAT You slept too near where you got in?
  ans:
  - I slept too near where I fell out.

- que:
  - Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you? Using all dose ten dollar words?
  ans:
  - Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.

- que:
  - EAT Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
  ans:
  - Dat's yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.

- que:
  - EAT How be dat?
  ans:
  - I don't know who I am.

- que:
  - A lot?
  ans:
  - Enough.

- que:
  - What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - The good stuff.

- que:
  - Are you trying to rap to me?
  ans:
  - This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny.

- que:
  - Oh you do, huh?
  ans:
  - Just a little something' somethin'.

- que:
  - You don't read, do you?
  ans:
  - Never read a book in my whole life.

- que:
  - Why don't you call him?
  ans:
  - For what? He left. Not me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You look beautiful like that.

- que:
  - How did you get this gig?
  ans:
  - Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.

- que:
  - You leave something out?
  ans:
  - After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.

- que:
  - And what?
  ans:
  - Stop playing me Sloan.

- que:
  - Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
  ans:
  - We did it one time, only once. It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid. Everything I've got I've earned.

- que:
  - Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
  ans:
  - Don't try to change to the subject.

- que:
  - Why don't you answer?
  ans:
  - I know I won't be your puppet.

- que:
  - Where are you bound for?
  ans:
  - That is none of your business.

- que:
  - Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
  ans:
  - Not at all, sir. I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.

- que:
  - Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
  ans:
  - Don't bully, Mr. Best. Here are the pistols. God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.

- que:
  - Hoity-toity! John Best, what's the matter here?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways. I ain't used to 'em, sir.

- que:
  - What is your uncle's name?
  ans:
  - O'Grady.

- que:
  - This is a very good inn. Shall we stop for dinner?
  ans:
  - This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.

- que:
  - Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
  ans:
  - Ah! You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.

- que:
  - Where's the beauty you promised me?
  ans:
  - Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.

- que:
  - Good morning, Private James. Please come in. I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
  ans:
  - Neither!

- que:
  - What are the Chevalier's intentions?
  ans:
  - I am not sure. The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.

- que:
  - Has he sent the challenge yet?
  ans:
  - Not yet, but I believe he intends to.

- que:
  - And his baggage?
  ans:
  - This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.

- que:
  - And so I am.
  ans:
  - The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?

- que:
  - Have you taken my message to him?
  ans:
  - The meeting is arranged. Captain Best is waiting for you now.

- que:
  - My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
  ans:
  - Your cousins go out with him.

- que:
  - Is Miss Dugan well?
  ans:
  - There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.

- que:
  - Good heavens! Whatever? Has she died of grief?
  ans:
  - She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband. She is now Mrs. John Best.

- que:
  - Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
  ans:
  - Whom have I been harboring in my house? Who are you, sirrah?

- que:
  - I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
  ans:
  - I will let down the steps for your honor.

- que:
  - Good gracious! What is this?
  ans:
  - You are going to drive to the frontier.

- que:
  - You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. Here is my letter.

- que:
  - Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - For whom else have you worked?
  ans:
  - No one, sir. Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.

- que:
  - Who else can give me information about you?
  ans:
  - Only the agency of servants.

- que:
  - But how, sir?
  ans:
  - Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital. I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.

- que:
  - Certain?
  ans:
  - Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.

- que:
  - Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
  ans:
  - Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.

- que:
  - Have you had one?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - But, for a time... a passing fancy?
  ans:
  - Not even that.

- que:
  - How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
  ans:
  - Not one.

- que:
  - Have you not a man whom you value?
  ans:
  - That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.

- que:
  - What! You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
  ans:
  - Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more. I could value only someone whom I loved.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.

- que:
  - You want my heart?
  ans:
  - It is my only object.

- que:
  - And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
  ans:
  - Then I will respectfully take leave of her.

- que:
  - You will do as you please. It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other. Do you not agree?
  ans:
  - Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.

- que:
  - Poor man. And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
  ans:
  - I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.

- que:
  - Will we always leave it at this?
  ans:
  - Always, my dear one, never any further. Love is a child to be pacified with trifles. A full diet can only kill it.

- que:
  - Why are you shaking?
  ans:
  - With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

- que:
  - Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
  ans:
  - But you refused me, Dorothy.

- que:
  - What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?
  ans:
  - Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.

- que:
  - I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
  ans:
  - As much as possible.

- que:
  - As much as possible?
  ans:
  - Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.

- que:
  - Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
  ans:
  - By name only.

- que:
  - Yes!
  ans:
  - Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

- que:
  - Does this assignment interest you?
  ans:
  - Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.

- que:
  - Was he cheated?
  ans:
  - In so far as I can tell these things -- no. I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.

- que:
  - When is he to go?
  ans:
  - Then this must be done tomorrow.

- que:
  - Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. Have you lost much?
  ans:
  - That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.

- que:
  - But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
  ans:
  - O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

- que:
  - May I be quite frank with you?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course.

- que:
  - Did you buy the horse, papa?
  ans:
  - Now, just have a little patience, my boy. Your birthday isn't until next week.

- que:
  - Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
  ans:
  - Good night, papa.

- que:
  - What the devil? What kind of fools do we have here? Pottle, who told the lad this story?
  ans:
  - I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.

- que:
  - Is he all right, papa?
  ans:
  - Yes, he's fine.

- que:
  - Would you have me spend my life all alone?
  ans:
  - In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - Come, come, sir. I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.

- que:
  - I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
  ans:
  - Sir, let those laugh that win.

- que:
  - Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
  ans:
  - Yes. He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.

- que:
  - And he doesn't care about me?
  ans:
  - He is only curious to know who you are.

- que:
  - Will he wish to know the details of this night?
  ans:
  - Tender Hegenheim.

- que:
  - Can I at least have a drink?
  ans:
  - It's ten thirty in the morning.

- que:
  - Hurricane kept you up, too?
  ans:
  - Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.

- que:
  - I'm -- I'm sorry...
  ans:
  - Who?

- que:
  - A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.

- que:
  - Shut up, Mueller.
  ans:
  - None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?

- que:
  - We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion -- Where's Pike?
  ans:
  - We found him like this...

- que:
  - You too?
  ans:
  - We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I asked for a policeman.

- que:
  - You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
  ans:
  - It's... too slow.

- que:
  - What do you like then?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I like the Army.

- que:
  - You did Basic here?
  ans:
  - There's no need...

- que:
  - Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
  ans:
  - I'm not telling you what happened.

- que:
  - Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
  ans:
  - Some.

- que:
  - And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.

- que:
  - You smoke, Ray?
  ans:
  - This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.

- que:
  - Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
  ans:
  - We've found all of them.

- que:
  - And the bodies?
  ans:
  - You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.

- que:
  - Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
  ans:
  - That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.

- que:
  - He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
  ans:
  - Epilepsy.

- que:
  - Mueller was alone in the cabin?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Where's the cabin?
  ans:
  - Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.

- que:
  - Can't do that now, though, can you?
  ans:
  - Ohhhh, I don't think so...

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - Your weapons, Sergeant.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.

- que:
  - Jesus, what happened?
  ans:
  - West... he's dead.

- que:
  - So you killed him?
  ans:
  - I...

- que:
  - Right?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
  ans:
  - Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.

- que:
  - If not you, then who?
  ans:
  - Mueller.

- que:
  - Look in my pack.
  ans:
  - Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just look. Little pocket.

- que:
  - Why... why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.

- que:
  - Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
  ans:
  - You saw West, right? How was he killed?

- que:
  - They?
  ans:
  - Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...

- que:
  - You... I've seen you around the Base. But you... You're not Army, are you?
  ans:
  - Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.

- que:
  - But not the only victim, right?
  ans:
  - My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.

- que:
  - Then who did?
  ans:
  - Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was... Enough to almost kill him.

- que:
  - Why did he come back for you?
  ans:
  - I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.

- que:
  - How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
  ans:
  - Mr. Hardy?

- que:
  - Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
  ans:
  - Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.

- que:
  - Is it the truth?
  ans:
  - Dunbar will testify that you were.

- que:
  - Something funny, Levi?
  ans:
  - Because of what I saw. Who really killed West.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Because I was standing next to him.

- que:
  - Maybe he...
  ans:
  - Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?

- que:
  - This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
  ans:
  - How are you?

- que:
  - And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
  ans:
  - It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.

- que:
  - I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
  ans:
  - Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.

- que:
  - Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
  ans:
  - The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.

- que:
  - Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
  ans:
  - And I'm the closest thing to it, right?

- que:
  - Who killed Pike?
  ans:
  - Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.

- que:
  - Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Does Osborne agree?
  ans:
  - That's horseshit and you know it.

- que:
  - They're taking your command, aren't they?
  ans:
  - The Senator...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You're drunk --

- que:
  - You knew Sergeant West?
  ans:
  - He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.

- que:
  - Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
  ans:
  - Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --

- que:
  - He's in interrogation?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That is the most unprofessional --
  ans:
  - Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.

- que:
  - Good cop/bad cop?
  ans:
  - Something like that.

- que:
  - You made me look like an idiot --
  ans:
  - Baseball?

- que:
  - You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
  ans:
  - You're right. We should sit in silence.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.

- que:
  - Something like that. You?
  ans:
  - I lost a bet.

- que:
  - This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
  ans:
  - The very same.

- que:
  - You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
  ans:
  - I plan to grow on you.

- que:
  - Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
  ans:
  - He's telling the truth, up to a point.

- que:
  - Something wrong?
  ans:
  - Being back here. Gives me the willies.

- que:
  - Not the happiest of memories?
  ans:
  - Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.

- que:
  - That was kid gloves?
  ans:
  - Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.

- que:
  - Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
  ans:
  - You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --

- que:
  - Why do you care?
  ans:
  - I didn't shoot West...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - At least you and Kendall agree on that.

- que:
  - What happened next?
  ans:
  - And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.

- que:
  - That bugs you too?
  ans:
  - Little bit.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Positive. Hardy, they planned this.

- que:
  - Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
  ans:
  - Good idea.

- que:
  - You mean the falsely accused?
  ans:
  - You wanted to break him.

- que:
  - So what now?
  ans:
  - Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

- que:
  - Think it'll work?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - That's gonna stay my secret.

- que:
  - Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
  ans:
  - No bodies, no West...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Seven guys. What was it you said? You were \"just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said\".

- que:
  - What if I don't want it?
  ans:
  - Tough.

- que:
  - West?
  ans:
  - Nobody saw. But I don't think so.

- que:
  - Do I have a choice in this?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.

- que:
  - Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

- que:
  - Think it'll work?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - Want company?
  ans:
  - A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

- que:
  - The faggot speaks.
  ans:
  - How?

- que:
  - You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
  ans:
  - We should tell him we're not going.

- que:
  - He said what?
  ans:
  - \"You're gonna die tonight, faggot\". Clear as day.

- que:
  - No one else heard it?
  ans:
  - He whispered it in my ear.

- que:
  - But you didn't see it, right?
  ans:
  - Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.

- que:
  - Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
  ans:
  - Fifty minutes.

- que:
  - What happened with Nunez?
  ans:
  - He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...

- que:
  - Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
  ans:
  - Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.

- que:
  - Sign here and here. Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - It's too neat.

- que:
  - You want Kendall, don't you?
  ans:
  - He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.

- que:
  - What happens to Dunbar now?
  ans:
  - Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.

- que:
  - I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
  ans:
  - Jesus, kid. Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?

- que:
  - Who is she? Where does she live?
  ans:
  - Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.

- que:
  - Didn't kill anything, did I?
  ans:
  - A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.

- que:
  - Welcome to ya. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Edward Bloom.

- que:
  - Bloom like a flower?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You were expecting me?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - What is this place?
  ans:
  - The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

- que:
  - The poet? What ever happened to him?
  ans:
  - He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - No one's ever left.

- que:
  - Or are you too scared?
  ans:
  - I'll go in right now and get that eye.

- que:
  - You get the eye?
  ans:
  - I brought it.

- que:
  - Can I see him?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.

- que:
  - How long have you known my father?
  ans:
  - Thirty years. Maybe more.

- que:
  - Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
  ans:
  - A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.

- que:
  - Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What did she look like?
  ans:
  - Well, she... uh...

- que:
  - Was she nekkid?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Eighteen.

- que:
  - How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
  ans:
  - I suspect it will hurt a lot.

- que:
  - How did you know?
  ans:
  - No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
  ans:
  - You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. You married.

- que:
  - Hi. How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - I was dreaming.

- que:
  - What were you dreaming about?
  ans:
  - That's terrible.

- que:
  - Can I take your picture?
  ans:
  - You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.

- que:
  - Please?
  ans:
  - That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.

- que:
  - Oh, so this is a tall tale?
  ans:
  - Well, it's not a short one.

- que:
  - Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
  ans:
  - Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.

- que:
  - Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
  ans:
  - I can.

- que:
  - What's your name, Giant?
  ans:
  - Karl.

- que:
  - You don't like it?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:
  - Beats me.

- que:
  - You're not trying to run away?
  ans:
  - Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

- que:
  - What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ.

- que:
  - Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
  ans:
  - Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.

- que:
  - Am I?
  ans:
  - Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...

- que:
  - You think I'm up for it?
  ans:
  - You learned from the best.

- que:
  - So how does it happen?
  ans:
  - Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - You owe me three-fifty.

- que:
  - When did you ever work in an office?
  ans:
  - There's a lot you don't know about me.

- que:
  - You know where the chemicals are?
  ans:
  - I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.

- que:
  - Why not religion, Dad?
  ans:
  - It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.

- que:
  - Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

- que:
  - What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
  ans:
  - I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.

- que:
  - What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
  ans:
  - Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.

- que:
  - The river?
  ans:
  - Tell me how it happens.

- que:
  - How what happens?
  ans:
  - How I go.

- que:
  - Where are we headed?
  ans:
  - You say...

- que:
  - Daffodils?
  ans:
  - They're your favorite flower.

- que:
  - How did you get so many?
  ans:
  - I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.

- que:
  - How can I convince you to stop?
  ans:
  - Go out with me.

- que:
  - Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
  ans:
  - I can't imagine any place better than here.

- que:
  - So what are you up to now?
  ans:
  - I'm robbing this place.

- que:
  - How did you know my father?
  ans:
  - This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.

- que:
  - Were you and my father having an affair?
  ans:
  - Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
  ans:
  - Because he's dying.

- que:
  - Do you like it, being pregnant?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - You never told me how your parents met.

- que:
  - Mmm, what?
  ans:
  - Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.

- que:
  - Do you love your father?
  ans:
  - Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.

- que:
  - Do you love him?
  ans:
  - But it's not true.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.

- que:
  - How did you get here?
  ans:
  - We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.

- que:
  - Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
  ans:
  - He's up with your father.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.

- que:
  - How much time does he have left?
  ans:
  - You don't talk about those things. Not yet.

- que:
  - Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Would you say you understand Josephine?
  ans:
  - Yes. But that's a different...

- que:
  - Was she one of your teachers?
  ans:
  - No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.

- que:
  - That really happened?
  ans:
  - Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.

- que:
  - Is he awake?
  ans:
  - He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.

- que:
  - Did you and Dad have any other property?
  ans:
  - I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.

- que:
  - Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
  ans:
  - Yes. Thank you.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - You know what for.

- que:
  - There's over eighty thousand here.
  ans:
  - Such as?

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.

- que:
  - Do you want to stop?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. I burnt myself.

- que:
  - Do you like it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.

- que:
  - A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
  ans:
  - Name it.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - What. You're what? You're with this creep now.

- que:
  - You can see why it's sensitive?
  ans:
  - Uh... Yes.

- que:
  - Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
  ans:
  - You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Sorry. You've lost me...

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He says he feels safe here.

- que:

- que:
  - No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?

  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Shut up. I'm not listening.

- que:
  - So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
  ans:
  - I don't hate you.

- que:
  - And? What are you saying?
  ans:
  - And. It's wrong.

- que:
  - So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
  ans:
  - Sometimes.

- que:
  - Sometimes which?
  ans:
  - Sometimes neither.

- que:
  - Some... What does that mean?
  ans:
  - There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.

- que:
  - I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
  ans:
  - Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You...

- que:
  - So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?

  - What?
  ans:
  - The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - She's alive!! She is not dead?
  ans:
  - Laugh it up.

- que:
  - Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
  ans:
  - I don't want anyone to die.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - You know you can come under the blanket.

- que:
  - I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
  ans:
  - No. I think I better just go.

  - Please. Why not?
  ans:
  - Because it was a lie.

- que:
  - Okay. Promise?

  ans:
  - I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.

  ans:

  - Why would you care?
  ans:
  - I still think you're a bastard.

  - He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.

- que:
  - What...? What if I say no?
  ans:
  - Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan. It's a nice, safe country.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - They said send a detective if I could spare one. I can always spare you.

- que:
  - Why don't you ask your chief detective?
  ans:
  - Because I want you to tell me.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Your visa has expired. Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.

- que:
  - The families who control the casinos?
  ans:
  - Yes. Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.

- que:
  - Why tell me this?
  ans:
  - The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.

- que:
  - You trust me?
  ans:
  - I'll pay you.

- que:
  - With these?
  ans:
  - Swiss bank deposit. Gold bullion. Whatever you want. You know the city and the police.

- que:
  - If I say no?
  ans:
  - You're smarter than Kobo. You know the price of deceit. Think about it.

- que:
  - If he won't cooperate?
  ans:
  - Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated. We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

- que:
  - I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian. What do you think, Mary?
  ans:
  - I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.

- que:
  - Pris?
  ans:
  - Let's go while there is still time.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Anywhere.

- que:
  - What's the point?
  ans:
  - Not to be trapped.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian. Why don't you go home.

- que:
  - Would you like to be modified?
  ans:
  - Had in mind something a little more radical.

- que:
  - What's the problem?
  ans:
  - Death.

- que:
  - What about E.M.S. recombination?
  ans:
  - Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - I've done some questionable things.

- que:
  - I like a man who stays put. An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
  ans:
  - You're just all so... so different.

- que:
  - What, Sebastian?
  ans:
  - You're androids.

- que:
  - What generation are you?
  ans:
  - Nexus - 6.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like...

- que:
  - You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
  ans:
  - Not only that, but we have smiliar problems. Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.

- que:
  - Dr. Tyrell?
  ans:
  - He's not really my friend. I just do a job for him now and then.

- que:
  - He could?
  ans:
  - His company made us.

- que:
  - When do you deliver your project?
  ans:
  - This afternoon.

- que:
  - Where are you going, Sebastian?
  ans:
  - Just thought I'd...

- que:
  - What's going on down there?
  ans:
  - He's not ready yet.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow, he says.

- que:
  - Not if everybody is doing their job here at home. How are things at home?
  ans:
  - I think, therefore I am.

- que:
  - You got a machine on it yet?
  ans:
  - We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm. Its guess is that all five are in the city.

- que:
  - What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
  ans:
  - Industrial refuse.

- que:
  - Garbage man?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You didn't like her!?
  ans:
  - Look, go home. Get some rest. Take an aspirin.

- que:
  - This is Bryant. Are you alone?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - She's not with you?
  ans:
  - Who.

- que:
  - If you don't, we will. It has to be total, Deckard. That's an order from as high as it comes. Got it?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I got it.

- que:
  - Well, when do you get paid?
  ans:
  - Soon as I finish the job.

- que:
  - When might that be?
  ans:
  - Day after tomorrow.

- que:
  - You equipped for random questions?
  ans:
  - Why, yes, of course.

- que:
  - I think we're through for the night.
  ans:
  - How do I stop one?

- que:
  - Do you have something against science?
  ans:
  - Not if it works.

- que:
  - And what in your estimation works?
  ans:
  - The umbrella.

- que:
  - Never mind. Do they have that knowledge?
  ans:
  - Longevity is classified. No.

- que:
  - Prosit.
  ans:
  - I'll but you one. What'll you have?

- que:
  - You want to see my friends?
  ans:
  - Sorry, don't have the time.

- que:
  - Those cockroaches?
  ans:
  - Ya.

- que:
  - How long you had these guys?
  ans:
  - Two months. But this one is not guy. It is girl. His girl.

- que:
  - One more, eh?
  ans:
  - I gotta piss.

- que:
  - How old am I?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
  ans:
  - Four years.

- que:
  - I'm great. I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great. How you like my new suit?
  ans:
  - Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.

- que:
  - Hey, it's okay. I like to pee. So how are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm doing okay.

- que:
  - From what I hear you're doing great. Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army. Making a lot of money, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

- que:
  - Money?
  ans:
  - No. I got a problem.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I'm taking a piss.

- que:
  - No rust?
  ans:
  - I didn't say that. Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Your mind kept wandering. That bothered me.

- que:
  - What if you change your mind?
  ans:
  - They'll change the limit before I change my mind.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Never been more sure of anything in my life.

- que:
  - Why didn't you go?
  ans:
  - Too old.

- que:
  - But if you could?
  ans:
  - My job is here.

- que:
  - Can I come in?
  ans:
  - I'd like you to take a look at these pictures.

- que:
  - Do you recognize any of them?
  ans:
  - This one looks familiar, but I don't know. Naw. There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The girl that doesn't look like that girl.

- que:
  - What's suck night?
  ans:
  - That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.

- que:
  - Book the good ones for where?
  ans:
  - Lots of places. The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...

- que:
  - Are you for real?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here. I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.

- que:
  - What the fuck for?
  ans:
  - For holes.

- que:
  - Of course he's not real. You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
  ans:
  - It's a good job.

- que:
  - Does it eat?
  ans:
  - Come on.

- que:
  - Hey! Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
  ans:
  - You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

- que:
  - And who do I go to about you?
  ans:
  - It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.

- que:
  - It's artificial?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Why should I be?
  ans:
  - For the responsibility of your power. Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.

- que:
  - Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
  ans:
  - You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

- que:
  - Is there anything else?
  ans:
  - I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.

- que:
  - Do I make you nervous?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - Sit.

- que:
  - You ever take a bath with a man before?
  ans:
  - There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - You didn't hear me. You were sleeping.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Me and my dad.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Dead.

- que:
  - How come you're not on the job?
  ans:
  - I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.

- que:
  - How are you doing?
  ans:
  - Not too good.

- que:
  - What do people do in the afternoon?
  ans:
  - If they are smart, they take naps.

- que:
  - Do you dream?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sometimes.

- que:
  - Did you cry when your father died?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - It wasn't very good last night, was it?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. I guess I thought there was something more to it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I think I missed something.

- que:
  - Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
  ans:
  - Don't be fooled by appearances.

- que:
  - It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
  ans:
  - They could clean around the arrangement.

- que:
  - You mean a woman?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - What's a long time?
  ans:
  - Ten years.

- que:
  - Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
  ans:
  - Because it's not.

- que:
  - Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
  ans:
  - Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.

- que:
  - Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - What difference will it make?
  ans:
  - Just wait here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.

- que:
  - Where the hell you been?
  ans:
  - You know where I been. I been on vacation.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Holden got hit.

- que:
  - Bad?
  ans:
  - Severed spine. You'd better get in here. Bryant's waiting for you.

- que:
  - Black?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Is this to be an empathy test?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - May I ask a personal question?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - One that relies on human interpretation. Where's the subject?
  ans:
  - Sitting next to you.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - If she is, the machine works.

- que:
  - How many questions did it take?
  ans:
  - Thirteen.

- que:
  - She didn't know?
  ans:
  - Memory implant. She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning. I think she was beginning to suspect.

- que:
  - How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
  ans:
  - Five, maybe six.

- que:
  - And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
  ans:
  - Discreetly.

- que:
  - How do you know I'm not?
  ans:
  - You're not responding to the stimulus. I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.

- que:
  - What desert?
  ans:
  - Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.

- que:
  - But how come I'd be there?
  ans:
  - Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows. So you look down and see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you...

- que:
  - Know what a turtle is?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - How come you were in my truck?
  ans:
  - I was tired and didn't have any place to go.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Pris.

- que:
  - You want to go home?
  ans:
  - I don't have one.

- que:
  - Where are your folks?
  ans:
  - They left.

- que:
  - What about friends?
  ans:
  - I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.

- que:
  - We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
  ans:
  - We sure did.

- que:
  - I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place?
  ans:
  - I was hoping you'd say that.

- que:
  - Whatcha doin'?
  ans:
  - You scared me.

- que:
  - And you live in this building all by yourself?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...

- que:
  - What's your problem?
  ans:
  - Methuselah Syndrome.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - My glands. They grow old too fast.

- que:
  - Is that why you're still here?
  ans:
  - Yes. I couldn't pass the test.

- que:
  - Ah, you get hold of your friends?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact I did. They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.

- que:
  - What makes you think so?
  ans:
  - I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.

- que:
  - No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How do you do?
  ans:
  - Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.

- que:
  - Come where?
  ans:
  - My office.

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - Please excuse this interruption.

- que:
  - Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
  ans:
  - Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?

- que:
  - Do ya?
  ans:
  - No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.

- que:
  - Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
  ans:
  - Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead.

- que:
  - Dickhead?
  ans:
  - A walking penis capable of intelligent speech. A dickhead.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - I just had a mental picture of...

- que:
  - I don't know. Why doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.

- que:
  - Yes, I'm right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
  ans:
  - Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?

- que:
  - Do you own a car?
  ans:
  - I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America, No strangers in the car.

- que:
  - You don't?
  ans:
  - He's all yours. I was holding him back.

- que:
  - So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And that's it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get in.
  ans:
  - I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?

- que:
  - So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
  ans:
  - Oh, I could die...

- que:
  - Okay.
  ans:
  - Over this?

- que:
  - Why are you doing that?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Hey, no kidding? In color?
  ans:
  - Cross my heart and hope to die.

- que:
  - ...Okay.
  ans:
  - Why doesn't it never work out?

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.

- que:
  - Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving people?
  ans:
  - Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.

- que:
  - How long would you need me?
  ans:
  - Two weeks.

- que:
  - What's fair?
  ans:
  - I've got to make at least a thousand a week.

- que:
  - Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
  ans:
  - They like Dr. Pepper.

- que:
  - Who are these people?
  ans:
  - My Mom and Dad.

- que:
  - Adam? Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry. I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - No, no! I'm sorry! What is it?
  ans:
  - This is for me.

- que:
  - A wife?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - They're all divorced?
  ans:
  - Everybody's divorced.

- que:
  - I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for?
  ans:
  - One who's not a mutant.

- que:
  - When do you need her by?
  ans:
  - Two weeks.

- que:
  - Could we talk about that a little later?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you, Cliff! May I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Um-hum.

- que:
  - Good for you.
  ans:
  - I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot?

- que:
  - Where's he gone?
  ans:
  - He's gone to check your answers on his computer.

- que:
  - He has a computer?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - In the house?
  ans:
  - No. We keep it in the backyard. Of course, in the house. It's in there.

- que:
  - May I please be excused?
  ans:
  - Uh...yeah.

- que:
  - About clothing?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Have you ever heard the saying, \"He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?\"
  ans:
  - What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?

- que:
  - What have you ordered?
  ans:
  - It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - No way.

- que:
  - Adam! She's got bitch written all over her! You do know what \"bitch\" means, don't you?
  ans:
  - Okay. I like that.

- que:
  - Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
  ans:
  - What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?

- que:
  - Okay. All right. And what do I say?
  ans:
  - Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

- que:
  - Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
  ans:
  - Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.

- que:
  - Is that what you call it?
  ans:
  - Sing it to me.

- que:
  - Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yes, Eve?
  ans:
  - I want you to go back to the hotel now. I'll call you a cab.

- que:
  - That's right. And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby. Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
  ans:
  - Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - A card?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The front door is open. Will you be back?
  ans:
  - I promise.

- que:
  - They're pretty. Can I have them?
  ans:
  - Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.

- que:
  - What's baseball?
  ans:
  - It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

- que:
  - Like a painting?
  ans:
  - No, son. A pitcher.

- que:
  - Like one of Mom's?
  ans:
  - Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.

- que:
  - The nocturnal flying mammal?
  ans:
  - No. Sit down.

- que:
  - Shit is a French word?
  ans:
  - C'est bon, Monsieur.

- que:
  - Yes, father?! Yes?
  ans:
  - ...the pipe tobacco.

- que:
  - Adult Bookstore. Why?
  ans:
  - Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

- que:
  - I promise. Is that all?
  ans:
  - One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.

- que:
  - This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
  ans:
  - It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.

- que:
  - You're sure?
  ans:
  - Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.

- que:
  - That's what everybody believes?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. It's true.

- que:
  - I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
  ans:
  - Not particularly.

- que:
  - And it's called...?
  ans:
  - Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic.

- que:
  - Really? Since when?
  ans:
  - Right on the button.

- que:
  - That's right?
  ans:
  - I've never met anyone like you in my life.

- que:
  - Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions. When did Alaska become a state?
  ans:
  - 1959.

- que:
  - Who use to own it?
  ans:
  - Russia.

- que:
  - When did we get it from them?
  ans:
  - 1867. Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.

- que:
  - What's the capitol?
  ans:
  - Juneau.

- que:
  - What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - You don't have a computer in your cabin?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How do you get through those winters? Well, you're right. Juneau. What's the highest peak?
  ans:
  - Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.

- que:
  - He's a Windows guy then, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes. He likes windows.

- que:
  - Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
  ans:
  - ...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.

- que:
  - Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
  ans:
  - A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.

- que:
  - Does that work?
  ans:
  - You dial nine to get out.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - The hotel.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Thirty-five.

- que:
  - How old do I look?
  ans:
  - Twenty-five? Around there.

- que:
  - Up here on the fifteenth floor?
  ans:
  - Yes, please. I'm looking for all beef patties.

- que:
  - Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
  ans:
  - Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.

- que:
  - Hi.
  ans:
  - Whatcha looking at?

- que:
  - How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
  ans:
  - I was thinking of selling all the cards.

- que:
  - Really? No kidding?
  ans:
  - See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that.

- que:
  - Oh, you got a problem with that?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.

- que:
  - Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
  ans:
  - Oh. A nice one, I hope.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.

- que:
  - What about relatives?
  ans:
  - All back East.

- que:
  - He drank it hot?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Good.
  ans:
  - You got a light, honey?

- que:
  - Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
  ans:
  - It's time.

- que:
  - Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio.

- que:
  - How long will we have to stay down here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.

- que:
  - To you maybe.
  ans:
  - Days?

- que:
  - What's that noise?
  ans:
  - The locks.

- que:
  - The locks?
  ans:
  - To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.

- que:
  - Hi, honey! Feeling better?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Maybe I've just got the creeps.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Uh, oh. Now it's time.

- que:
  - Is there a problem?
  ans:
  - No, Calvin. Babies cry.

- que:
  - What shall we call him?
  ans:
  - Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.

- que:
  - You bet.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Yes...
  ans:
  - No kidding. Who else would have done it?

- que:
  - Would you excuse me?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - In the generator room again?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.

- que:
  - Should we say a little prayer first?
  ans:
  - Just open the door.

- que:
  - Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
  ans:
  - We stay down here.

- que:
  - We do?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How long will you set it for this time?
  ans:
  - I thought ten years.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I forgot some of my stuff.

- que:
  - Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
  ans:
  - You know, I don't know. And looking at you, I don't care. It's been too long, Eve.

- que:
  - So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
  ans:
  - Out-of-town. That's all he'll say.

- que:
  - I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
  ans:
  - Give me your hand.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.

- que:
  - Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm sensing.

- que:
  - Well, what do you think?
  ans:
  - Uh..he might of.

- que:
  - What's that mean?
  ans:
  - We did not leave together.

- que:
  - I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
  ans:
  - To bed.

- que:
  - To bed?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.

- que:
  - Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Where did he get all that information?
  ans:
  - Fallout shelter.

- que:
  - What do you want to do with it?
  ans:
  - Give it back to him.

- que:
  - And if we can't find him?
  ans:
  - We'll find him.

- que:
  - Yeah! That's thinking.
  ans:
  - What's wrong?

- que:
  - An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
  ans:
  - Come on.

- que:
  - Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
  ans:
  - None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.

- que:
  - I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
  ans:
  - Um...uh...

- que:
  - Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
  ans:
  - Buy it from me?

- que:
  - Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
  ans:
  - Stand by. One.

- que:
  - I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
  ans:
  - Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?

- que:
  - Yeah. How's Dad?
  ans:
  - I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.

- que:
  - Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

- que:
  - Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm not sick.

- que:
  - Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
  ans:
  - Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
  ans:
  - I've seen a few.

- que:
  - Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
  ans:
  - Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.

- que:
  - Are you Detective Williams?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You did? A human ear?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

- que:
  - These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Anything you can tell me?
  ans:
  - The criminals are winning.

- que:
  - Is that why you say it's horrible?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why do you do it?
  ans:
  - I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.

- que:
  - What is this? What color is it?
  ans:
  - Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

- que:
  - What color is it?
  ans:
  - It's blue. Blue velvet.

- que:
  - Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

- que:
  - Is Sandy part of this?
  ans:
  - No, not at all.

- que:
  - Who knows you have these?
  ans:
  - Only you and the photo lab.

- que:
  - You're all through with this now?
  ans:
  - We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

- que:
  - Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Yes? What is it?
  ans:
  - Pest control, gotta do your apartment.

- que:
  - Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
  ans:
  - Jeffrey nothing.

- que:
  - You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
  ans:
  - I wanted to see you.

- que:
  - What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
  ans:
  - Nobody.

- que:
  - That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
  ans:
  - Well.

- que:
  - THEN WHAT?
  ans:
  - Then you got undressed.

- que:
  - How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
  ans:
  - Never before this.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - I, I don't know.

- que:
  - Do you like that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you like talk like that?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Nothing. Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Sure I'm alright.

- que:
  - Don?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you like the way I feel?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - See my breasts? See?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - See my nipples?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you like me?
  ans:
  - Yes, I like you.

- que:
  - Do you know?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No. What is happening?
  ans:
  - Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

- que:
  - Hi, can I come in?
  ans:
  - Yeah, hurry up though.

- que:
  - Why are you here. Whatiya want?
  ans:
  - I, uh.

- que:
  - Frank? Can you stand up?
  ans:
  - I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.

- que:
  - Nice guy. Who's he?
  ans:
  - Who's it, you mean.

- que:
  - Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
  ans:
  - Look.

- que:
  - Don? Are you in with them?
  ans:
  - No. But you're in very big trouble.

- que:
  - Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
  ans:
  - No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. Don't hate me.

- que:
  - Do you like my body?
  ans:
  - Sure I do.

- que:
  - What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I'm doing it.

- que:
  - Whatiya mean?
  ans:
  - Do you want to do bad things? Anything, anything.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That wouldn't be too good, would it?
  ans:
  - Frank would open you.

- que:
  - Does that scare you?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - Look, snap out of it, will ya?
  ans:
  - Kiss me.

- que:
  - Do you love me?
  ans:
  - I asked first.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.

- que:
  - I did. Are you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

- que:
  - Hold me, Don.
  ans:
  - Who, Dorothy?

- que:
  - Frank gone?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.

- que:
  - He's comin' back? What for?
  ans:
  - Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

- que:
  - Oh he forced you, huh?
  ans:
  - No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

- que:
  - Who's this fuck?
  ans:
  - He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.

- que:
  - Where are we going, Frank?
  ans:
  - Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.

- que:
  - You want to see him too, right?
  ans:
  - Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

- que:
  - Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
  ans:
  - Those are my breasts.

- que:
  - Can I feel 'em?
  ans:
  - If you want to.

- que:
  - We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
  ans:
  - You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

- que:
  - Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me?
  ans:
  - We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Speak to me Fucker.

- que:
  - No thanks. What does that mean?
  ans:
  - I don't want to go.

- que:
  - Go where?
  ans:
  - On a ride.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.

- que:
  - What are you lookin' at?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes. You like me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
  ans:
  - No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.

- que:
  - Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
  ans:
  - This is it.

- que:
  - What time are visiting hours?
  ans:
  - I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

- que:
  - Do you want the car?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just gonna walk around.

- que:
  - Can I use the car tonight?
  ans:
  - Of course, Jeffrey.

- que:
  - Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'm fine.

- que:
  - Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

- que:
  - Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - Alright.

- que:
  - Would you like a piece of cake?
  ans:
  - No. No thank you.

- que:
  - Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
  ans:
  - Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

- que:
  - Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
  ans:
  - Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

- que:
  - Uh-uh.
  ans:
  - Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

- que:
  - Are you feeling okay?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:
  - How ya doin' Dad?
  ans:
  - Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

- que:
  - Yeah, how did you know?
  ans:
  - I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

- que:
  - You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
  ans:
  - Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.

- que:
  - No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How is Central these days?
  ans:
  - Terrible boring.

- que:
  - Yeah. What are you doing now?
  ans:
  - I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

- que:
  - The ear is from a missing person maybe?
  ans:
  - Maybe so.

- que:
  - I guess you have to get back home soon?
  ans:
  - Not really, why? You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

- que:
  - Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
  ans:
  - I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.

- que:
  - Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home?
  ans:
  - I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.

- que:
  - What happened to him?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He moved away.

- que:
  - You hungry or thirsty, or both?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I'm here, aren't I?
  ans:
  - I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

- que:
  - What will I say when she comes to the door?
  ans:
  - I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.

- que:
  - Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
  ans:
  - Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

- que:
  - Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
  ans:
  - No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

- que:
  - Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
  ans:
  - I owe you, since I goofed up this one.

- que:
  - You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
  ans:
  - Yes. I do.

- que:
  - You really want to do this, don't you?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

- que:
  - Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.

- que:
  - It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but.

- que:
  - Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - Oh, okay, can I call?
  ans:
  - Okay, yeah, call.

- que:
  - Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, thanks.

- que:
  - That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, okay. Bye.

- que:
  - Well, how did it go? What happened?
  ans:
  - Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

- que:
  - What's with Mike?
  ans:
  - He got a little jealous.

- que:
  - You want a Dairy Queen?
  ans:
  - No way. I'm about to blow up.

- que:
  - Wow. Should you tell my father?
  ans:
  - I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.

- que:
  - Twice. Without her sensing anything?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you see her undressed?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

- que:
  - Who, me? Why should it?
  ans:
  - That's what I thought.

- que:
  - Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
  ans:
  - Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.

- que:
  - I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, be careful.

- que:
  - Can I give you a kiss good night?
  ans:
  - You better not, Jeffrey.

- que:
  - You want to go talk to him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.

- que:
  - That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
  ans:
  - Shoot.

- que:
  - Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
  ans:
  - Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Jeffrey!!

- que:
  - I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Jeffrey? Why?
  ans:
  - I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.

- que:
  - You like mysteries that much?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.

- que:
  - You worry about me really?
  ans:
  - Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.

- que:
  - You didn't tell him about me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Just some fatherly advice.

- que:
  - What was that all about?
  ans:
  - Nothing, really! It's good to see you.

- que:
  - Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
  ans:
  - I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.

- que:
  - Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
  ans:
  - I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

- que:
  - You want to dance?
  ans:
  - I can't dance fast.

- que:
  - Really. You want to dance with someone else?
  ans:
  - NO.

- que:
  - You want to dance?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Dorothy Vallens?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Probably not. No. Why?
  ans:
  - Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.

- que:
  - Jeffrey? What's going on?
  ans:
  - Shhh. I'll tell you.

- que:
  - Yeah, nice meetin' you.
  ans:
  - Sandy?

- que:
  - What are watchin' this junk for?
  ans:
  - You can change it if you want to.

- que:
  - Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
  ans:
  - Sure, just a sec. Excuse me.

- que:
  - Come on out a minute, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What did he bring him in for?
  ans:
  - Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

- que:
  - Up where?
  ans:
  - Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.

- que:
  - The Duke? What did you do?
  ans:
  - Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.

- que:
  - What did you do, Connor?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
  ans:
  - Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Any word back from the E.R.s?
  ans:
  - Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.

- que:
  - This is a six-shooter.
  ans:

- que:
  - Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
  ans:
  - All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.

- que:
  - You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
  ans:
  - We... met them last night.

- que:
  - So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
  ans:
  - We paid attention in school.

- que:
  - Know any other languages?
  ans:
  - Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.

- que:
  - So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
  ans:
  - I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.

- que:
  - I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
  ans:
  - Be careful.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.

- que:
  - Hey Murphy?
  ans:
  - Aye.

  ans:
  - Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.

  - All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.

- que:
  - How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
  ans:
  - Italian.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.

- que:
  - Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
  ans:
  - I'm serious.

- que:
  - Is that right, Rambo?
  ans:
  - All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - A bit.

- que:
  - Where the fuck are you going?
  ans:
  - We'll find it. Just calm down.

- que:
  - Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
  ans:
  - Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.

- que:
  - Where are you goin'? Did you tell him?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - So what do you think?
  ans:
  - I'm strangely comfortable with it.

- que:
  - So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
  ans:
  - Give the guy a shot.

- que:
  - Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
  ans:
  - There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!

- que:
  - Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
  ans:
  - That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.

- que:
  - Can she I.D. them?
  ans:
  - They were wearing masks.

- que:
  - Of course they were. How many?
  ans:
  - Three.

- que:
  - Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
  ans:
  - Maybe the three of them had something in common.

- que:
  - How do you figure?
  ans:
  - So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.

- que:
  - The what man?
  ans:
  - The fat man.

- que:
  - Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
  ans:
  - He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.

- que:
  - Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
  ans:
  - It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.

- que:
  - No way they could have seen it?
  ans:
  - Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.

- que:
  - Why was I not informed of this?
  ans:
  - Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.

- que:
  - Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.

- que:
  - How many bodies, Greenly?
  ans:
  - Eight.

- que:
  - Witness?
  ans:
  - No way they could have seen it.

- que:
  - Who were the victims?
  ans:
  - I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.

- que:
  - Just called ta torture us did ya?
  ans:
  - But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.

- que:
  - So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
  ans:
  - Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.

- que:
  - What are you serious?
  ans:
  - Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hey Murph.

- que:
  - No. You sure you're okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hey, Murph.

- que:
  - No. You sure you're okay?
  ans:
  - Y'know it is, a bit.

- que:
  - So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
  ans:
  - Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.

- que:
  - Well, what'ya do?
  ans:
  - You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.

- que:
  - What the fuck do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean he ain't here.

- que:
  - Hello? You there?
  ans:
  - Y-Yes my son.

- que:
  - Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
  ans:
  - Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.

- que:
  - What is it my son?
  ans:
  - God's permission? God doesn't...

- que:
  - You believe?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You feel?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Has he now?
  ans:
  - I guess not.

- que:
  - You know them personally?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
  ans:
  - No. They would never do that.

- que:
  - You gonna do what I say, got it?
  ans:
  - That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.

- que:
  - What do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - Just be natural, goddamit.

- que:
  - How long since your last confession, my son?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

- que:
  - Yeah boss?
  ans:
  - The... The funny man.

- que:
  - What color hair does he have?
  ans:
  - Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.

- que:
  - Making Hutch David Soul?
  ans:
  - He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - As part of his plan. I don't know why.

- que:
  - What does Starsky say?
  ans:
  - He says. This is he.

- que:
  - This is he?
  ans:
  - No. This is he.

- que:
  - Did you see what I meant about the window?
  ans:
  - Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.

- que:
  - Would they do that?
  ans:
  - Who knows? That's why I filed it down.

- que:
  - What do you think the cops have?
  ans:
  - Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.

- que:
  - But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
  ans:
  - I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.

- que:
  - How was I ridiculing you?
  ans:
  - You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.

- que:
  - Did you see that?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I saw it.

- que:
  - Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
  ans:
  - Eight dollars.

- que:
  - Is it back in?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - There's another stocker, right?
  ans:
  - We know there's another stocker.

- que:
  - Is that the manager?
  ans:
  - Unlock that door. Check the aisles.

- que:
  - What about what that guy said?
  ans:
  - Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.

- que:
  - Can I get that credit card from you?
  ans:
  - I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because my mom gets the bill.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - They obviously weren't designed for racing.

- que:
  - Bob?
  ans:
  - Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.

- que:
  - Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
  ans:
  - Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

- que:
  - Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
  ans:
  - I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.

- que:
  - May I have a word with you, please?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
  ans:
  - No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.

- que:
  - They don't?
  ans:
  - No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.

- que:
  - Which one was that?
  ans:
  - On the left.

- que:
  - Bob?
  ans:
  - See, now we've got a plan.

- que:
  - Where was it parked?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - When'd he tell you?
  ans:
  - This morning.

- que:
  - Where was I?
  ans:
  - You were asleep.

- que:
  - I have an idea for that.
  ans:
  - If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?

- que:
  - Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
  ans:
  - I don't think we can do that.

- que:
  - Where's the rest?
  ans:
  - I had to give some to Inez.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - $383.

- que:
  - You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
  ans:
  - Ah. Couple days ago.

- que:
  - That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You really hit a guy with a bottle?
  ans:
  - I want you to look at this.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.

- que:
  - What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
  ans:
  - Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.

- que:
  - Who's Mr. Henry?
  ans:
  - You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.

- que:
  - What exactly is this place? Freezers?
  ans:
  - Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

- que:
  - What time did he say to be here?
  ans:
  - Right now.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - He seems pretty good.

- que:
  - What the fuck are we doing out here?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.

- que:
  - OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
  ans:
  - Eleven fifteen.

- que:
  - Did that hurt?
  ans:
  - I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.

- que:
  - As a person?
  ans:
  - Yeah. As a girl.

- que:
  - We all set?
  ans:
  - Hang on a second.

- que:
  - Uh-huh?
  ans:
  - Take your second position.

- que:
  - Any activity?
  ans:
  - Not at all. The place is totally deserted.

- que:
  - What's happening? What's going on?
  ans:
  - It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.

- que:
  - Who did that? What the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - It's going back down.

- que:
  - Careful. Check his pulse.
  ans:
  - Applejack! What's happening?

- que:
  - Who tripped the alarm?
  ans:
  - It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.

- que:
  - Where's Kumar?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Let's go. Come on.

- que:
  - Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
  ans:
  - Come on.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'll see you there.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'll get him.

- que:
  - So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.

- que:
  - He did?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What'd he get?
  ans:
  - Pretty much everything.

- que:
  - You think Applejack knew?
  ans:
  - We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We're not sure.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You're living on a sailboat?
  ans:
  - It belongs to Bob's uncle.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Behind Bob's house.

- que:
  - Does it float?
  ans:
  - We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.

- que:
  - So how is it in there?
  ans:
  - What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.

- que:
  - What's he in for?
  ans:
  - He stole a tractor.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Shhh. Wait for my instructions.

- que:
  - Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
  ans:
  - This is my business manager, Rowboat.

- que:
  - Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
  ans:
  - I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.

- que:
  - You mean a safecracker?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want, Kumar Banijamali.

- que:
  - I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
  ans:
  - What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.

- que:
  - That was a test?
  ans:
  - Take a deep breath.

- que:
  - How does that feel?
  ans:
  - It feels good.

- que:
  - Did Dignan take the test?
  ans:
  - Yes, he did.

- que:
  - How'd he do?
  ans:
  - That sounds like Dignan.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - No, that door over there.

- que:
  - Are you afraid?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.

- que:
  - The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini?
  ans:
  - No. Bob did.

- que:
  - Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
  ans:
  - Anthony, I'm petrified.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Why'd you want to help us?
  ans:
  - Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.

- que:
  - Did you ever steal a car before?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.

- que:
  - In your backyard? How do you protect them?
  ans:
  - It's private property. Plus I have Hector.

- que:
  - Could you grow cinnamon?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Sure, I guess.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He said that.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - Move.

- que:
  - You think he got my license plates?
  ans:
  - He looked too shaken-up.

- que:
  - How long are they going to hold him?
  ans:
  - I'm not playing any more golf.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.

- que:
  - You think I'm improving?
  ans:
  - Yes. You just got to stick with it.

- que:
  - Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
  ans:
  - Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Well, because you guys don't look alike.

- que:
  - Was Future Man adopted?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ! No.

- que:
  - No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I was just asking.

- que:
  - No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.

- que:
  - Let me see it. Did you drop it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Temporarily.
  ans:
  - Who's got the car keys?

- que:
  - How do you say nineteen?
  ans:
  - Dies y nueve.

- que:
  - Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Were you born in Mexico?
  ans:
  - Cuba.

- que:
  - Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
  ans:
  - God, yes. Like silk.

- que:
  - Like silk?
  ans:
  - God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.

- que:
  - You're Anthony?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:
  - S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:
  - Abdul-Shabazz?
  ans:
  - I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Feel this.

- que:
  - Where'd they come from?
  ans:
  - The front stairs.

- que:
  - Where were you?
  ans:
  - Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.

- que:
  - Is that him?
  ans:
  - Wait a second.

- que:
  - That's your friend Anthony?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's he doing here?
  ans:
  - Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.

- que:
  - Wait. Did he see us?
  ans:
  - We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.

- que:
  - Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
  ans:
  - Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.

- que:
  - Are you a fag?
  ans:
  - You're the faggot.

- que:
  - I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
  ans:
  - I'm not allowed to drive those.

- que:
  - Not even for emergencies?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So who's going to know?
  ans:
  - My brother.

- que:
  - What are you talking about, Bob?
  ans:
  - Can you use a coaster.

- que:
  - Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
  ans:
  - I'll just drive my car.

- que:
  - If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
  ans:
  - Good question.

- que:
  - What was that all about?
  ans:
  - I can't believe you said that.

- que:
  - What did I say?
  ans:
  - I told you he's crazy.

- que:
  - Where'd she go?
  ans:
  - Maybe she turned.

- que:
  - Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
  ans:
  - You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.

- que:
  - His name was Swifty?
  ans:
  - Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.

- que:
  - Did we get it?
  ans:
  - Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light.

- que:
  - How much is there?
  ans:
  - Don't count it.

- que:
  - You really think he'll remember you?
  ans:
  - No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.

- que:
  - Bob, will you please listen?
  ans:
  - I don't want to talk about it.

- que:
  - So it's my fault?
  ans:
  - There were more than that.

- que:
  - Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't move.

- que:
  - Is he chasing us?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What the fuck possessed you?
  ans:
  - You're the one who kept saying ram him.

- que:
  - Bob. Are you coming?
  ans:
  - See you in a little while.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - The weed.

- que:
  - But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
  ans:
  - They said he's a drug dealer.

- que:
  - I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
  ans:
  - Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.

- que:
  - So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
  ans:
  - I was just going to use it to see how much I had.

- que:
  - How long has he been in there?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What do you mean get back?
  ans:
  - Well, obviously, we got to go back.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Just get in the car, Bob.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.

- que:
  - Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
  ans:
  - Not bad.

- que:
  - Come on in. What you been up to?
  ans:
  - Man, I don't want to go into this.

- que:
  - Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
  ans:
  - It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.

- que:
  - Stand by. Bird Dog?
  ans:
  - I couldn't hear anything.

- que:
  - What's wrong with Applejack?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - I didn't think there was an alarm.

- que:
  - Where's Applejack?
  ans:
  - He's stuck between two floors.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.

- que:
  - Do you have your own room?
  ans:
  - We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.

- que:
  - Do you have your own cell?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it.

- que:
  - You keeping out of trouble?
  ans:
  - I'm trying.

- que:
  - He said what?
  ans:
  - He said you ran away from home.

- que:
  - How long do you have to go?
  ans:
  - 26 weeks.

- que:
  - And what does that cover?
  ans:
  - Social issues. Crime prevention.

- que:
  - Hand to hand combat?
  ans:
  - Ground defense.

- que:
  - Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack. Who are you?
  ans:
  - This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.

- que:
  - What do you mean grammar?
  ans:
  - The basic grammatical rules of robbing.

- que:
  - The grammar?
  ans:
  - Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.

- que:
  - Is he good?
  ans:
  - He's damn good.

- que:
  - You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well, I think --
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Why did he go that way?
  ans:
  - He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember? Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - What's the story?
  ans:
  - Can't get it. It won't...

- que:
  - What can we do?
  ans:
  - We're closed, sir.

- que:
  - Where's that guy going?
  ans:
  - He left his sweater.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - In the cash register. Step away from the door.

- que:
  - Where is he? Where is Rob?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.

- que:
  - Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
  ans:
  - No. I just have short hair.

- que:
  - Is that your chiquita?
  ans:
  - No, my friend knows her.

- que:
  - You like Chicanos?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Fight. You know.

- que:
  - You Hoto?
  ans:
  - Fuck you. You a Hoto.

- que:
  - No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - The world needs dreamers, son.
  ans:
  - How's the weather down there?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.

- que:
  - Will it track back to us?
  ans:
  - No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.

- que:
  - And the Landy woman?
  ans:
  - She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now. You'll have to hurry.

- que:
  - Bourne comes here? Why?
  ans:
  - Treadstone.

- que:
  - And what are we looking for?
  ans:
  - I want to know about Treadstone.

- que:
  - What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
  ans:
  - I want to know what happened.

- que:
  - Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
  ans:
  - ...this is Conklin's computer.

- que:
  - Do you know what his budget was?
  ans:
  - Excuse me.

- que:
  - And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
  ans:
  - May I finish?

- que:
  - Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
  ans:
  - Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.

- que:
  - So what's he doing? You believe him?
  ans:
  - Sorry to wake you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.

- que:
  - Did he say anything to you?
  ans:
  - No... It must have been Bourne.

- que:
  - Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
  ans:
  - Don't know.

- que:
  - And Danny Zorn, what was that?
  ans:
  - Had to be done.

- que:
  - No good options left?
  ans:
  - No. You lost your way.

- que:
  - She say what time I should call?
  ans:
  - The sooner the better.

- que:
  - It was staged?
  ans:
  - Is it a slam dunk? No, but...

- que:
  - Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
  ans:
  - Keep going...

- que:
  - Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
  ans:
  - Lots of people...

- que:
  - Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
  ans:
  - Show me again...

- que:
  - It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. It's just a picture.

- que:
  - It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - I killed them.

- que:
  - How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to forgive me.

- que:
  - Is this really happening?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - So why didn't you kill me then?
  ans:
  - She wouldn't let me. She's the only reason you're alive.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Conklin.

- que:
  - You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Who sent you to Greece?
  ans:
  - A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.

- que:
  - Pamela Landy?
  ans:
  - I don't know who that is.

- que:
  - I don't know! Why would I lie?
  ans:
  - I did.

- que:
  - You called it in?
  ans:
  - We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.

- que:
  - I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
  ans:
  - I worry when you get like this.

- que:
  - No... How?
  ans:
  - The Telegraph office.

- que:
  - But you're sure?
  ans:
  - He was at the campground yesterday.

- que:
  - It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
  ans:
  - That's crazy.

- que:
  - You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.

- que:
  - What if it's not who you think it is?
  ans:
  - If he crosses the bridge, it is.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - I only dream about people who are dead.

- que:
  - See that tram coming around the corner?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Who is Pamela Landy?
  ans:
  - You hear me? I believed you.

- que:
  - What is this, a game?
  ans:
  - I want to hear it from you.

- que:
  - A Russian?
  ans:
  - It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.

- que:
  - Last week? When?
  ans:
  - And you got to him before we could.

- que:
  - I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
  ans:
  - I killed him?

- que:
  - Abbott?
  ans:
  - He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...

- que:
  - For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
  ans:
  - No. You never worked Berlin.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to come in.

- que:
  - Okay, how do you want to do it?
  ans:
  - I want someone I know to take me in.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.

- que:
  - Are you disappointed?
  ans:
  - Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.

- que:
  - Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
  ans:
  - Don't need it. I remember everything.

- que:
  - And the Germans can't match it?
  ans:
  - Looks like he's been detained.

- que:
  - Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
  ans:
  - I want to look at the room. Check it out.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.

- que:
  - What? The tapes?
  ans:
  - Hold on... Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...

- que:
  - Here?
  ans:
  - That's where we came out.

- que:
  - How long have you worked for the agency?
  ans:
  - Me? Four years.

- que:
  - I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir -- ma'am...

- que:
  - Amnesia?
  ans:
  - Before this? Before Bourne? No.

- que:
  - Are you an expert in amnesia?
  ans:
  - Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.

- que:
  - Believed what?
  ans:
  - I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.

- que:
  - Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story. Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
  ans:
  - You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.

- que:
  - And why is that?
  ans:
  - Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.

- que:
  - Is it fresh?
  ans:
  - It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.

- que:
  - What do you think? Is he coming in?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Felt promising. It's a start.

- que:
  - Do we know what this says?
  ans:
  - No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.

- que:
  - By who?
  ans:
  - His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.

- que:
  - Are we hacking or asking?
  ans:
  - Yes. In that order.

- que:
  - We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
  ans:
  - My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.

- que:
  - Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
  ans:
  - It was in Latin, sir.

- que:
  - What are they doing?
  ans:
  - Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

- que:
  - But... what will you do?
  ans:
  - I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.

- que:
  - Does anyone know his politics?
  ans:
  - No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.

- que:
  - May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
  ans:
  - He was a modest man.

- que:
  - I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
  ans:
  - If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?

- que:
  - What news of the north?
  ans:
  - Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.

- que:
  - The Scots will fight for us?
  ans:
  - What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.

- que:
  - Now, my flower, do you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.

- que:
  - You mock us with a smile?
  ans:
  - I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.

- que:
  - Is it true? Wallace is captured?
  ans:
  - Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.

- que:
  - When will his trial be?
  ans:
  - Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.

- que:
  - Stephen ready?
  ans:
  - I wanna have supper waitin'.

- que:
  - Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
  ans:
  - I could crush you like a roach.

- que:
  - Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
  ans:
  - Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.

- que:
  - Where is my son?
  ans:
  - If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.

- que:
  - You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
  ans:
  - ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.

- que:
  - I have faced him. Have you?
  ans:
  - Let her speak.

- que:
  - Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
  ans:
  - Treason. Against whom?

- que:
  - Your father doesn't like me, does he?
  ans:
  - It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.

- que:
  - Did it work?
  ans:
  - No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.

- que:
  - How do you know this?
  ans:
  - Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.

- que:
  - Wife of Edward, the king's son?
  ans:
  - I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.

- que:
  - But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
  ans:
  - I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.

- que:
  - Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
  ans:
  - That is not possible.

- que:
  - Why did you?
  ans:
  - Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.

- que:
  - No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
  ans:
  - M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.

- que:
  - Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
  ans:
  - Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.

- que:
  - And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
  ans:
  - We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.

- que:
  - What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
  ans:
  - The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.

- que:
  - Who would do such a thing?
  ans:
  - Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.

- que:
  - Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
  ans:
  - Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.

- que:
  - Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
  ans:
  - Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.

- que:
  - Why? What for?
  ans:
  - Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...

- que:
  - And the bad news?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.

- que:
  - But you must have something to go on?
  ans:
  - If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.

- que:
  - But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
  ans:
  - Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.

- que:
  - When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
  ans:
  - You know the answer to that.

- que:
  - Can't he come out for one day?
  ans:
  - We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.

- que:
  - I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - My father has a bad memory, too?
  ans:
  - These'll bring you luck, Crockett.

- que:
  - Honey. What were you doing with that?
  ans:
  - I... I don't remember.

- que:
  - Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Something must've happened! What set him off?
  ans:
  - I... I blacked out.

- que:
  - Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
  ans:
  - Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.

- que:
  - Why do you ask?
  ans:
  - No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.

- que:
  - What? What could he do?
  ans:
  - ...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.

- que:
  - How long will I be in here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. These things take time.

- que:
  - How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
  ans:
  - I found these. The others are still in storage.

- que:
  - Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
  ans:
  - Cute, Evan.

- que:
  - What does that mean for Evan?
  ans:
  - There must be a way to fix this.

- que:
  - Fix?
  ans:
  - I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.

- que:
  - How. Did you. Know that?
  ans:
  - You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.

- que:
  - Can you protect me?
  ans:
  - Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.

- que:
  - Weirder than this?
  ans:
  - Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.

- que:
  - So you believe me?
  ans:
  - Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father.

- que:
  - Dad lives here?
  ans:
  - Not in this wing, actually. No.

- que:
  - Where are you now?
  ans:
  - I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.

- que:
  - Are you hurting her?
  ans:
  - No, protecting her.

- que:
  - Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
  ans:
  - I see a car.

- que:
  - Are you sure? Not even with my father?
  ans:
  - This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.

- que:
  - Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
  ans:
  - Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.

- que:
  - My journals! Where are they?
  ans:
  - Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...

- que:
  - Photos?
  ans:
  - Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.

- que:
  - You really think he wanted to kill you?
  ans:
  - Shhh! I need quiet for this.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Fuck off, frat boy.

- que:
  - I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
  ans:
  - Oh God... what did we do?

- que:
  - You really don't remember anything that happened?
  ans:
  - Ouch.

- que:
  - Damn. Your dad did this?
  ans:
  - I deserve a lot worse.

- que:
  - I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
  ans:
  - He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.

- que:
  - He must be. They're letting him go, right?
  ans:
  - Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.

- que:
  - God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
  ans:
  - Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

- que:
  - So how's Tommy?
  ans:
  - They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.

- que:
  - Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
  ans:
  - She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.

- que:
  - Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
  ans:
  - It was a long time ago.

- que:
  - Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
  ans:
  - No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.

- que:
  - Where... where are my clothes?
  ans:
  - Those are your clothes, silly.

- que:
  - Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Just being weird.

- que:
  - So it didn't feel... weird?
  ans:
  - Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.

- que:
  - I don't understand, where are you taking me?
  ans:
  - You'll see.

- que:
  - Why are you doing all this for me?
  ans:
  - Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.

- que:
  - Like how?
  ans:
  - I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.

- que:
  - I walk differently?
  ans:
  - I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...

- que:
  - Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
  ans:
  - Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?

- que:
  - Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
  ans:
  - So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.

- que:
  - Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
  ans:
  - No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.

- que:
  - Ha! Where's that?
  ans:
  - The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.

- que:
  - What's happened to you?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, \"You wouldn't believe me\", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.

- que:
  - Why's that?
  ans:
  - Because you're... different.

- que:
  - Different? How?
  ans:
  - Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.

- que:
  - Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
  ans:
  - You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.

- que:
  - I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
  ans:
  - I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.

- que:
  - Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
  ans:
  - Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.

- que:
  - Know what?
  ans:
  - That I didn't leave you there to rot.

- que:
  - Which is?
  ans:
  - There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.

- que:
  - Sure you don't want your wallet?
  ans:
  - Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.

- que:
  - Is something the matter?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.

- que:
  - Kayleigh? Do you ever think about \"us?\" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
  ans:
  - Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.

- que:
  - I was?
  ans:
  - That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.

- que:
  - I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
  ans:
  - It's crossed my mind from time to time.

- que:
  - Then you think it might have worked out?
  ans:
  - Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.

- que:
  - We're really gonna be in a movie!?
  ans:
  - That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.

- que:
  - Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
  ans:
  - Calm down, kid. Stand still.

- que:
  - I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
  ans:
  - Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.

- que:
  - Who -- who are you?
  ans:
  - ...yes.

- que:
  - There is no \"right\". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
  ans:
  - It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?

- que:
  - Who's to say you can't make things better?
  ans:
  - You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.

- que:
  - Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
  ans:
  - We'll find out soon enough.

- que:
  - I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
  ans:
  - Hey, I got no choice.

- que:
  - Just don't drop the ball, okay?
  ans:
  - I won't let you down, Professor Carter.

- que:
  - And you are...?
  ans:
  - Evan Treborn.

- que:
  - So what's the point?
  ans:
  - Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.

- que:
  - Can... can... Can I have this?
  ans:
  - Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.

- que:
  - Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
  ans:
  - Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.

- que:
  - Are you sure you even packed it?
  ans:
  - My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.

- que:
  - Destroy it?
  ans:
  - If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.

- que:
  - Hey, what'd you do that for?
  ans:
  - Fat little baby, crying for mommy.

- que:
  - Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
  ans:
  - Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.

- que:
  - Lung cancer?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.

- que:
  - None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Never heard of her.

- que:
  - What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
  ans:
  - Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.

- que:
  - Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

- que:
  - Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
  ans:
  - How did you get in here? You're under age.

- que:
  - No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
  ans:
  - He did. Captain Renault did.

- que:
  - I thought so. Where's your husband?
  ans:
  - At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.

- que:
  - How long have you been married?
  ans:
  - So you decided to go to America.

- que:
  - Does he know that?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - And he is still willing to give you a visa?
  ans:
  - He always has.

- que:
  - You want my advice?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, please.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

- que:
  - What is your name?
  ans:
  - Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.

- que:
  - Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. It is.

- que:
  - Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
  ans:
  - Yes, Monsieur.

- que:
  - Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - No thanks, Carl.

- que:
  - How long can I afford to stay closed?
  ans:
  - Oh, two weeks, maybe three.

- que:
  - Hello, Rick.
  ans:
  - Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?

- que:
  - Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
  ans:
  - Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.

- que:
  - What do you want for Sam?
  ans:
  - I don't buy or sell human beings.

- que:
  - My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
  ans:
  - I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.

- que:
  - And the carrying charges?
  ans:
  - Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.

- que:
  - Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
  ans:
  - It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

- que:
  - Well, good luck. But be careful. You know you're being shadowed?
  ans:
  - Yes, something.

- que:
  - Do you know where they are?
  ans:
  - Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

- que:
  - Rick?
  ans:
  - He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.

- que:
  - And Mademoiselle?
  ans:
  - You needn't be concerned about me.

- que:
  - Occupied France?
  ans:
  - Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

- que:
  - And the other alternative?
  ans:
  - My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.

- que:
  - And I was wondering.
  ans:
  - Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.

- que:
  - Why there is no other man in my life?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Ten years ago? Let's see... ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
  ans:
  - Looking for a job.

- que:
  - Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
  ans:
  - Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.

- que:
  - All right. At a quarter to five. Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
  ans:
  - That's too far ahead to plan.

- que:
  - Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
  ans:
  - Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

- que:
  - Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
  ans:
  - I didn't count the days.

- que:
  - Has it got a wow finish?
  ans:
  - I don't know the finish yet.

- que:
  - Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did you get in?
  ans:
  - The stairs from the street.

- que:
  - I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
  ans:
  - Richard, I had to see you.

- que:
  - Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
  ans:
  - It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

- que:
  - Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
  ans:
  - Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.

- que:
  - And Laszlo?
  ans:
  - Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.

- que:
  - Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
  ans:
  - No, not yet.

- que:
  - But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
  ans:
  - Because you're getting on that plane.

- que:
  - I don't understand. What about you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - But what about us?
  ans:
  - We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.

- que:
  - Where is Rick?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.

- que:
  - When will he be back?
  ans:
  - Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.

- que:
  - Does he always leave so early?
  ans:
  - Oh, he never... well... he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.

- que:
  - Won't you join us?
  ans:
  - This time they really mean to stop me.

- que:
  - We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
  ans:
  - I must find out what Berger knows.

- que:
  - But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
  ans:
  - Yes, I would.

- que:
  - He does. Could we have a table close to him?
  ans:
  - And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.

- que:
  - What happened with Rick?
  ans:
  - We'll discuss it later.

- que:
  - Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
  ans:
  - Apparently he has the letters.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

- que:
  - Did he give any reason?
  ans:
  - He suggested I ask you.

- que:
  - Ask me?
  ans:
  - Yes, Victor, I was.

- que:
  - I know how it is to be lonely. Is there anything you wish to tell me?
  ans:
  - No, Victor, there isn't.

- que:
  - Are you ready Ilsa?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm ready. Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

- que:
  - Sam?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - -- Is what?
  ans:
  - Hello, Rick.

- que:
  - You're saying this only to make me go.
  ans:
  - Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?

- que:
  - How do you do?
  ans:
  - One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

- que:
  - Won't you join us for a drink?
  ans:
  - And I congratulate you.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Your work.

- que:
  - Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
  ans:
  - Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.

- que:
  - Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
  ans:
  - I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - I said, ask your wife.

- que:
  - My wife?
  ans:
  - Well, this might come in handy.

- que:
  - Had a close one, eh?
  ans:
  - Yes, rather.

- que:
  - Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
  ans:
  - We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.

- que:
  - You love her that much?
  ans:
  - Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.

- que:
  - Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
  ans:
  - No. It's all arranged.

- que:
  - Everything in order?
  ans:
  - All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.

- que:
  - But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
  ans:
  - I understand.

- que:
  - Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yes. What is it you want?
  ans:
  - Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.

- que:
  - I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
  ans:
  - I slept very well.

- que:
  - With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
  ans:
  - I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.

- que:
  - Are you quite finished with us?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.

- que:
  - Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
  ans:
  - Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.

- que:
  - And that is?
  ans:
  - You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.

- que:
  - You will give us the names?
  ans:
  - You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.

- que:
  - By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
  ans:
  - Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.

- que:
  - How do you do, Mr. Rick?
  ans:
  - Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.

- que:
  - Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
  ans:
  - I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.

- que:
  - A leader, like Laszlo?
  ans:
  - Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.

- que:
  - What is the meaning of that phone call?
  ans:
  - Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

- que:
  - Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
  ans:
  - Ask Monsieur Rick.

- que:
  - You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
  ans:
  - When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

- que:
  - Why? What's in Lisbon?
  ans:
  - The clipper to America.

- que:
  - And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
  ans:
  - My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

- que:
  - What, again?
  ans:
  - This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.

- que:
  - Yeah? Have a brandy?
  ans:
  - I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.

- que:
  - Yeah? What's his name?
  ans:
  - Victor Laszlo.

- que:
  - Victor Laszlo?
  ans:
  - Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.

- que:
  - Manages what?
  ans:
  - His escape.

- que:
  - Is that a serious offer?
  ans:
  - I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.

- que:
  - Why two?
  ans:
  - He is traveling with a lady.

- que:
  - Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
  ans:
  - Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.

- que:
  - Yeah, you were saying?
  ans:
  - Excuse me.

- que:
  - Oh, how do you do?
  ans:
  - And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.

- que:
  - Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
  ans:
  - Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

- que:
  - Why do you interfere with my little romances?
  ans:
  - Well, they're all excellent reasons.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

- que:
  - What friend?
  ans:
  - Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.

- que:
  - I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
  ans:
  - I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

- que:
  - Is everything ready?
  ans:
  - I have the letters right here.

- que:
  - Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
  ans:
  - Sam's piano.

- que:
  - Have you taken leave of your senses?
  ans:
  - I have. Sit down over there.

- que:
  - I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
  ans:
  - I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.

- que:
  - You think of everything, don't you?
  ans:
  - And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

- que:
  - Our expenses?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Where were you last night?
  ans:
  - That's so long ago, I don't remember.

- que:
  - Will I see you tonight?
  ans:
  - I never make plans that far ahead.

- que:
  - What is your nationality?
  ans:
  - I'm a drunkard.

- que:
  - Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
  ans:
  - It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

- que:
  - Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
  ans:
  - I haven't the slightest idea.

- que:
  - Are my eyes really brown?
  ans:
  - My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

- que:
  - In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
  ans:
  - Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.

- que:
  - Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
  ans:
  - Hello?

- que:
  - May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.

- que:
  - Thank you. Will you have a drink with me please?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I forgot. You never drink with... I'll have another, please. You despise me, don't you?
  ans:
  - If I gave you any thought, I probably would.

- que:
  - But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
  ans:
  - I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.

- que:
  - Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
  ans:
  - Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - Not right now.

- que:
  - Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You ever going to bed?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Shut up and go home, will you?
  ans:
  - No, sir. I'm staying right here.

- que:
  - Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
  ans:
  - Uh, my watch stopped.

- que:
  - What's that you're playing?
  ans:
  - Just a little something of my own.

- que:
  - This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
  ans:
  - You said it! Here's looking at you, kid.

- que:
  - Where is she? Have you seen her?
  ans:
  - No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.

- que:
  - So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
  ans:
  - It's bad.

- que:
  - If they can't see you, what's the point?
  ans:
  - Survive today, that's the point.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Can't kill another one. Can't. Can't kill my friends anymore.

- que:
  - Why do they have to die for me?
  ans:
  - They'd eat you if they could. They're laughing at you. Listen.

- que:
  - Yeah, sure, what?
  ans:
  - You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. Thank you God.

- que:
  - What's so damn funny?
  ans:
  - You are.

- que:
  - Let's get a second opinion. Wilson? What do you see?
  ans:
  - What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day? The next day we just start over again.

- que:
  - You know what happened to this?
  ans:
  - As much as anybody.

- que:
  - Possible. So you did those wings?
  ans:
  - Yeah. A long time ago.

- que:

  ans:
  - No. that was the last one.

  ans:

- que:
  - You? Personally?
  ans:

  ans:
  - You smell like formaldehyde.

- que:
  - How was Russia?
  ans:
  - Cold.

  ans:
  - I thought I did.

- que:
  - Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well?
  ans:
  - Chuck.

- que:
  - Let me guess, Russia came up?

  ans:
  - Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

  - What will you do?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I really don't know.

- que:

  ans:
  - The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.

- que:
  - Anything else?
  ans:
  - There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.

- que:
  - Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
  ans:
  - Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above.

- que:
  - You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
  ans:
  - Not to mention on me.

- que:
  - Need some help?
  ans:
  - You bet I do. High tide comes right up to this road.

- que:
  - You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - But chickens?
  ans:
  - True enough. No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Come on down to the plant. It's state of the art. We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.

- que:
  - What happened to your pants?
  ans:
  - Mom, meet Jango.

- que:
  - Look, I help take care of the place. You got my check, didn't you Mom?
  ans:
  - That new roof, that's your doing.

- que:
  - I wanted to come here.
  ans:
  - When'd you start working here?

- que:
  - I've got all this back pay coming. Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
  ans:
  - This is my home. I'm part of the wallpaper.

- que:
  - What about the sender?
  ans:
  - Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.

- que:
  - Can you find her?
  ans:
  - You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it.

- que:
  - Who is this? Where is Kamal?
  ans:
  - It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.

- que:

  ans:
  - Borrowed. I borrowed it.

- que:
  - How'd it go?
  ans:
  - Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - It was fifteen minutes late.

- que:
  - What? Let Paris hold its plane? Let Memphis take care of it? Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
  ans:
  - Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.

- que:
  - Talk is cheap. Are we on or not?
  ans:
  - We're on.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

- que:
  - Want to see my raft?
  ans:
  - This stinks really bad.

- que:
  - You were how long on this?
  ans:
  - Forty-three days.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's what it's about.

- que:
  - What, then?
  ans:
  - Deliver this package. Then, I dunno.

- que:
  - San Francisco. And you?
  ans:
  - As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.

- que:
  - Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of \"seeing the world,\" isn't it?
  ans:
  - Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.

- que:
  - I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
  ans:
  - Dr. Homer Wells.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.

- que:
  - What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
  ans:
  - Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.

- que:
  - What'd she die of?
  ans:
  - She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...

- que:
  - What are you going to tell the little ones?
  ans:
  - I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.

- que:
  - Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
  ans:
  - They'll believe it because they want to believe it.

- que:
  - Shouldn't we tell Homer?
  ans:
  - If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.

- que:
  - How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
  ans:
  - Daddy, *please*...

- que:
  - How many months are you?
  ans:
  - Two.

- que:
  - Is your family in the apple business, too?
  ans:
  - No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I've never seen the ocean, either.

- que:
  - So. Not bored yet?
  ans:
  - I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.

- que:
  - Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
  ans:
  - You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.

- que:
  - A movie *outside*?
  ans:
  - Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.

- que:
  - When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
  ans:
  - Yes! I've only seen one, though.

- que:
  - You've seen only one movie? Which one?
  ans:
  - \"King Kong\". It's really good.

- que:
  - And what did she die of, exactly?
  ans:
  - Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.

- que:
  - What are you so crazy about the movies for?
  ans:
  - At least you were never lonely.

- que:
  - You don't miss it?
  ans:
  - I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.

- que:
  - Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
  ans:
  - Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.

- que:
  - Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
  ans:
  - The *speaker*. For the movie sound.

- que:
  - How could you not *care* about the movie?
  ans:
  - You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.

- que:
  - Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
  ans:
  - I *know* this was right.

- que:
  - Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
  ans:
  - It will be okay.

- que:
  - What* will be okay?
  ans:
  - We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.

- que:
  - So we should \"wait and see.\" For how long?
  ans:
  - I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.

- que:
  - It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
  ans:
  - We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...

- que:
  - Nothing.
  ans:
  - Mr. Rose *knows*?

- que:
  - Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
  ans:
  - No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.

- que:
  - What do you want me to *do*?
  ans:
  - Please don't make me say it again.

- que:
  - How is that Wally doing?
  ans:
  - Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...

- que:
  - You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
  ans:
  - No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...

- que:
  - So many children. Are they all orphans?
  ans:
  - He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.

- que:
  - Homer* liked it! Didn't you?
  ans:
  - I thought they might take me.

- que:
  - Nobody's asked for me, have they?
  ans:
  - Nobody special enough, Curly.

- que:
  - You mean somebody asked?
  ans:
  - Only the right people can have you, Curly.

- que:
  - How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
  ans:
  - That's a heavy sedation.

- que:
  - So here is my candidate. What do you think?
  ans:
  - But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...

- que:
  - Is *your* father dead?
  ans:
  - Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.

- que:
  - Liver* killed him?
  ans:
  - Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.

- que:
  - But did you know him?
  ans:
  - Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.

- que:
  - Did you know your mother better?
  ans:
  - She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.

- que:
  - What's a nanny do?
  ans:
  - She looks after other people's children.

- que:
  - Did you grow up around here?
  ans:
  - No. She was an immigrant.

- que:
  - What's an immigrant?
  ans:
  - Someone not from Maine.

- que:
  - Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
  ans:
  - Uh... it's the end of October.

- que:
  - Is that soon?
  ans:
  - Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.

- que:
  - Did you bite it?
  ans:
  - I don't remember.

- que:
  - What kind of plane are you flying?
  ans:
  - A B-24 Liberator.

- que:
  - Have you enlisted?
  ans:
  - They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.

- que:
  - Really! Is it serious?
  ans:
  - No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.

- que:
  - Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
  ans:
  - Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.

- que:
  - You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. I need a job.

- que:
  - At what altitude?
  ans:
  - I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.

- que:
  - Migrants?
  ans:
  - It's almost like flying.

- que:
  - What about the trees?
  ans:
  - The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.

- que:
  - So. What should I do now?
  ans:
  - Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.

- que:
  - It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
  ans:
  - Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.

- que:
  - What business is you in, Homer?
  ans:
  - Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.

- que:
  - There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
  ans:
  - Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.

- que:
  - When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
  ans:
  - I'm stayin', Homer.

- que:
  - Where'd she get you?
  ans:
  - There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.

- que:
  - First pregnancy?
  ans:
  - Yes, for both.

- que:
  - You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
  ans:
  - One, it's illegal. Two, I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.

- que:
  - I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
  ans:
  - There was no visible wound?

- que:
  - Where's the name sheet?
  ans:
  - Nobody's named this one yet.

- que:
  - Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
  ans:
  - Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.

- que:
  - Good-bye, Arthur. Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - How long's this been going on, Muddy?
  ans:
  - It's just my heart.

- que:
  - What you got a picture of your heart for?
  ans:
  - There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.

- que:
  - Do you like to read?
  ans:
  - I can't read. Nobody taught me.

- que:
  - Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
  ans:
  - Almost.

- que:
  - You okay, Rose?
  ans:
  - I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...

- que:
  - I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
  ans:
  - Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.

- que:
  - That's *it*?
  ans:
  - Now, now. He's a good boy.

- que:
  - Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
  ans:
  - Do you know him?

- que:
  - Then it's malaria?
  ans:
  - It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon. Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed. Waist down. He won't walk.

- que:
  - When will he be home, Major?
  ans:
  - Mind your own business, Peaches.

- que:
  - What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
  ans:
  - Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.

- que:
  - What* view?
  ans:
  - Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.

- que:
  - She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
  ans:
  - You* taught her, I suppose...

- que:
  - That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
  ans:
  - That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.

- que:
  - That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
  ans:
  - Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.

- que:
  - What's lucky about that?
  ans:
  - You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...

- que:
  - Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
  ans:
  - You ever see a palm tree, Homer?

- que:
  - Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
  ans:
  - Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.

- que:
  - Silicon Valley?
  ans:
  - Can --

- que:
  - What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
  ans:
  - What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.

- que:
  - Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
  ans:
  - Big.Com. That Internet thing.

- que:
  - And you have this letter of intent?
  ans:
  - Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.

- que:
  - Ten percent. Of how much?
  ans:
  - Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.

- que:
  - I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
  ans:
  - It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.

- que:
  - The Anti-Christ?
  ans:
  - No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.

- que:
  - Your life flashing before your eyes?
  ans:
  - Just the last three weeks.

- que:
  - Isn't it always?
  ans:
  - I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.

- que:
  - And these cops? What do they get?
  ans:
  - Keeping the Fix happy.

- que:
  - So how'd you get caught?
  ans:
  - Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.

- que:
  - Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
  ans:
  - You're a superstitious fucker.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - She had you tempting fate.

- que:
  - Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
  ans:
  - You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.

- que:
  - Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
  ans:
  - Today? Started off great...

- que:
  - Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
  ans:
  - Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.

- que:
  - Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
  ans:
  - It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.

- que:
  - Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
  ans:
  - So we go to the bar.

- que:
  - And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
  ans:
  - Ten is standard, sir.

- que:
  - What's a King Pin?
  ans:
  - Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.

- que:
  - Mob?
  ans:
  - Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.

- que:
  - Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
  ans:
  - You're pissed we didn't get credit?

- que:
  - We sure Big Al threw him to us?
  ans:
  - Come on...

- que:
  - We're going to give him the money back?
  ans:
  - Fuck that. We're going too.

- que:
  - Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
  ans:
  - This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.

- que:
  - I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
  ans:
  - Masters of our own destiny.

- que:
  - So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
  ans:
  - Moonan. Here. Shit...

- que:
  - I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
  ans:
  - It can buy you a new and better you.

- que:
  - I just don't know if this says, \"me\". What's the fabric?
  ans:
  - Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.

- que:
  - And what about Big Al?
  ans:
  - Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tonight. Just me.

- que:
  - How much we going after?
  ans:
  - Two million.

- que:
  - She up for this?
  ans:
  - She's up for it.

- que:

  ans:
  - Eight A.M. flight.

- que:
  - Calls?
  ans:
  - We'll use the Euc.

- que:
  - Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
  ans:
  - You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.

- que:
  - Let me repeat -- Why not?
  ans:
  - Because you killed one of my crew.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You ask a lot of questions. Come on. Let me see 'em.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - I think two million.

- que:
  - Stake you?
  ans:
  - I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.

- que:
  - That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
  ans:
  - Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

- que:
  - Listen, Scooter --
  ans:
  - Hey Skippy? Do I have the word \"chump\" tattooed on my forehead?

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I said take off your fucking shirt.

- que:
  - You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
  ans:
  - Come here. Feel this.

- que:
  - That tip not work-out for you fellas?
  ans:
  - Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.

- que:
  - Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
  ans:
  - Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.

- que:
  - Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...? It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.

- que:
  - Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
  ans:
  - Great. Thank you.

- que:
  - What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
  ans:
  - My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.

- que:
  - Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Very much so.

- que:
  - Says who?
  ans:
  - We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.

- que:
  - Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
  ans:
  - Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.

- que:
  - No. What's my cut?
  ans:
  - You get an equal cut.

- que:
  - What do I have to do?
  ans:
  - Just play a part. A little acting.

- que:
  - What about Customs?
  ans:
  - I'll worry about Customs.

- que:
  - What the hell's his problem?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
  ans:
  - You need to get a haircut.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - And some new clothes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You're just going to have to trust me.

- que:
  - Uh... Everything okay?
  ans:
  - We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...

- que:
  - For what? A couple hundred bucks?
  ans:
  - I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.

- que:
  - Do you have something to prove?
  ans:
  - Not in that repressed anger sort of way.

- que:
  - Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
  ans:
  - I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.

- que:
  - So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
  ans:
  - No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.

- que:
  - How do you know I will?
  ans:
  - Sounds respectable.

- que:
  - You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
  ans:
  - Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.

- que:
  - Did, uh... Did you kill him?
  ans:
  - No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.

- que:
  - Everyone's working an angle, right?
  ans:
  - What about...

- que:
  - You got my cell. Leave a message.
  ans:
  - What about what?

- que:
  - What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
  ans:
  - You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.

- que:
  - Stop waving that thing around.
  ans:
  - What do you want? An apology?

- que:
  - You sure we're clear?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
  ans:
  - I'm getting a ride.

- que:
  - You better hurry. The police will be here any second. I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
  ans:
  - We're working for the King.

- que:
  - Wait a second... Who's the mope?
  ans:
  - No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.

- que:
  - What do we need another Shill for?
  ans:
  - Breasts.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...

- que:
  - I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
  ans:
  - Good point.

- que:
  - Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
  ans:
  - We never had a problem with that before.

- que:
  - Is it all fugasi?
  ans:
  - No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - But if you wanna talk about bad luck...

- que:
  - What do we do? We change the scam?
  ans:
  - Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.

- que:
  - Jake? Customs?
  ans:
  - Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.

- que:
  - Do you have a ticket?
  ans:
  - You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.

- que:
  - Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
  ans:
  - With identification.

- que:
  - I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - You going to have the time?
  ans:
  - I'll find the time.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.

- que:
  - He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
  ans:
  - Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.

- que:
  - What's up with you? Bladder infection?
  ans:
  - Keep it up.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Stand up.

- que:
  - Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse. You into something big?
  ans:
  - Pretty much.

- que:
  - In over your head?
  ans:
  - Pretty much.

- que:
  - Can I speak to you in confidence?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh. She's alright.

- que:
  - Then who's the Banker?
  ans:
  - The King.

- que:
  - I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
  ans:
  - It's not history.

- que:
  - So what do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.

- que:
  - We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
  ans:
  - The King, huh? Nice going.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.

- que:
  - A Fed? Is he close?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.

- que:
  - So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
  ans:
  - I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.

- que:
  - Special Agent?
  ans:
  - You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.

- que:
  - If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
  ans:
  - I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.

- que:
  - I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
  ans:
  - Let's just say he burned me once.

- que:
  - You guys awake?
  ans:
  - We're here.

- que:
  - What do you get out of it?
  ans:
  - Peace of mind.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - Not everyone's on the take, Walter.

- que:
  - Good... I gotta go. So, what do you have for me?
  ans:
  - Whaddya mean? We got dick.

- que:
  - To who?
  ans:
  - You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.

- que:
  - You trust this Moonan guy?
  ans:
  - High five.

- que:
  - Jack. Do you need a ride?
  ans:
  - No. Thanks.

- que:
  - Why did you quit?
  ans:
  - I got scared.

- que:
  - Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
  ans:
  - The Indian rope-trick.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.

- que:
  - What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
  ans:
  - A couple I know are getting married.

- que:
  - What's the Blue Book price?
  ans:
  - That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.

- que:
  - How about fifteen hundred?
  ans:
  - How about five hundred.

- que:
  - Is that your idea of arithmetic?
  ans:
  - I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.

- que:
  - What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
  ans:
  - She went back to South Africa.

- que:
  - Right. Look, I must get back to Habib.
  ans:
  - All right. As what?

- que:
  - Habib?
  ans:
  - My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book. Take care.

- que:
  - Who was he?
  ans:
  - She.

- que:
  - Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating?
  ans:
  - Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.

- que:
  - Good night?
  ans:
  - Not particularly.

- que:
  - And your lady?
  ans:
  - She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.

- que:
  - A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Not entirely.

- que:
  - How's that football story corning along?
  ans:
  - You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.

- que:
  - You want me drunk?
  ans:
  - I won't be that long.

- que:
  - It's not just inner beauty, is it?
  ans:
  - Turn around.

- que:
  - Where did you get it?
  ans:
  - I. sold the car.

- que:
  - What job?
  ans:
  - In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.

- que:
  - How did you land that?
  ans:
  - It came my way. 450 a week.

- que:
  - 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
  ans:
  - I had training. In the Republic.

- que:
  - Are you trying to read my palm?
  ans:
  - You've got such beautiful hands.

- que:
  - What's the time?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How did it go?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - You're shaking. What is it?
  ans:
  - Tension. It'll go.

- que:
  - Are you drunk?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - Do you have to swear all the time?
  ans:
  - Marion, stop this.

- que:
  - Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
  ans:
  - What are you doing here? You know the rules.

- que:
  - What about a drink on the way home?
  ans:
  - I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.

- que:
  - Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I don't like it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You were talking in your sleep.

- que:
  - Never. Why do you ask?
  ans:
  - I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.

- que:
  - How did you know I was here?
  ans:
  - I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.

- que:
  - There was a message, wasn't there?
  ans:
  - It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.

- que:
  - Marion! What did you tell the police?
  ans:
  - Nothing about you.

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.

- que:
  - Why did you take the money?
  ans:
  - I hate public transport.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I want to buy a car.

- que:
  - How can anyone be that naive?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Found a job?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
  ans:
  - So how are you doing, dad?

- que:
  - You know where I'm from?
  ans:
  - I've lived there.

- que:
  - That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
  ans:
  - Impossible to calculate.

- que:
  - So why did you come to my casino?
  ans:
  - I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.

- que:
  - Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
  ans:
  - First visit to London?

- que:
  - Your father?
  ans:
  - I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.

- que:
  - That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
  ans:
  - We all came from Africa, supposedly.

- que:
  - Do you believe in astrology?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.

- que:
  - How did you hurt your hand?
  ans:
  - Just an accident. Nothing.

- que:
  - Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
  ans:
  - You don't like cheats, do you.

- que:
  - Which side do you like?
  ans:
  - You choose.

- que:
  - What kind of trouble?
  ans:
  - I owe a lot of money.

- que:
  - Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
  ans:
  - Who's they?

- que:
  - Robbery's not criminal?
  ans:
  - You're serious.

- que:
  - What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
  ans:
  - It won't.

- que:
  - What ten thousand pounds?
  ans:
  - Reynolds? You've done your research.

- que:
  - What about my neck?
  ans:
  - I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.

- que:
  - How much do you owe?
  ans:
  - Let it go.

- que:
  - Did they tell you to sleep with me?
  ans:
  - I told you, all bets are off.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I have to take the car.

- que:
  - Is it yes?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Would you like a drink?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - Jani! Where are you?
  ans:
  - Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.

- que:
  - Did you solve your problems?
  ans:
  - I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.

- que:
  - Have I?
  ans:
  - I'm Lucy.

- que:
  - Are you going to put a spell on me?
  ans:
  - I might.

- que:
  - Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
  ans:
  - Too much. Eighteen hundred.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - Turn left at the lights.

- que:
  - Where do you live, Jack?
  ans:
  - Over the river.

- que:
  - Have you got transport?
  ans:
  - I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.

- que:
  - How long have you worked at the casino?
  ans:
  - Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you talking about?
  ans:
  - That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.

- que:
  - What are you, a cop?
  ans:
  - If I see you do it again, I'll report it.

- que:
  - I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
  ans:
  - Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.

- que:
  - Who are these guys?
  ans:
  - Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.

- que:
  - Just girls. What are you drinking?
  ans:
  - Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.

- que:
  - Does Bella come here?
  ans:
  - That bitch? No.

- que:
  - Rough day?
  ans:
  - Rough life, Jack.

- que:
  - What happened to Bella?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you later.

- que:
  - Has he?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where did you go to school?
  ans:
  - I was at Beadles.

- que:
  - Do you have a Salon Prive?
  ans:
  - We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.

- que:
  - Why four? And not three or five?
  ans:
  - It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.

- que:
  - Any exceptions?
  ans:
  - 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.

- que:
  - You use two alternating, don't you?
  ans:
  - We do.

- que:
  - Where's the magnet?
  ans:
  - They've been tested.

- que:
  - Haven't you forgotten something?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - What happens if I want to sneeze?
  ans:
  - You won't. Not without permission.

- que:
  - How many aces are left?
  ans:
  - Five.

- que:
  - What makes you so sure?
  ans:
  - It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.

- que:
  - You want me to check?
  ans:
  - I said good call.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.

- que:
  - Ever?
  ans:
  - I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

- que:
  - Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
  ans:
  - We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.

- que:
  - Girlfriend?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - She's not in the gaming business is she?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Does he win?
  ans:
  - He's a good customer.

- que:
  - How do you feel, Jack?
  ans:
  - Bruised.

- que:
  - What flickering light?
  ans:
  - The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.

- que:
  - Oh. What's wrong now?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.

- que:
  - Look, bomb...
  ans:
  - Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?

- que:
  - What's he doin'?
  ans:
  - We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.

- que:
  - Doolittle, are you there?
  ans:
  - What was that, I didn't hear...

- que:
  - What the hell?
  ans:
  - Yoo hoo, bomb...

- que:
  - Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
  ans:
  - Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.

- que:
  - It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
  ans:
  - Well, there's the possibility of...

- que:
  - Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
  ans:
  - Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.

- que:
  - Talby, can you read me?
  ans:
  - Energy shielding positive function.

- que:
  - Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
  ans:
  - Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.

- que:
  - Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb 20. Do you read me, bomb?
  ans:
  - Bomb 20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.

- que:
  - One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
  ans:
  - Energy shielding positive function.

- que:
  - Do you remember the detonation time?
  ans:
  - Detonation in twenty minutes.

- que:
  - You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Therefore, I shall ignore you.

- que:
  - Bomb?
  ans:
  - Snap out of it, bomb.

- que:
  - Hello, bomb, are you with me?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
  ans:
  - I am always receptive to suggestions.

- que:
  - Fine. Think about this one, then, how do you know you exist?
  ans:
  - Well of course I exist.

- que:
  - But how do you know you exist?
  ans:
  - It is intuitively obvious.

- que:
  - Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
  ans:
  - Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.

- que:
  - That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
  ans:
  - My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.

- que:
  - All right now, here's the big question, how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
  ans:
  - In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.

- que:
  - Why don't you have more time?
  ans:
  - Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.

- que:
  - Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
  ans:
  - To explode, of course.

- que:
  - And you can only do it once, right?
  ans:
  - That is correct.

- que:
  - And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
  ans:
  - Mafhkin oble groop...

- que:
  - Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
  ans:
  - I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.

- que:
  - Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
  ans:
  - New star. Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.

- que:
  - Which one?
  ans:
  - Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.

- que:
  - Any planets?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Eight, it says here.

- que:
  - Any of 'em any good?
  ans:
  - Naah. All stable.

- que:
  - The new star. What are you gonna name it?
  ans:
  - Who cares. Don't bother me.

- que:
  - Wha?
  ans:
  - I hereby name this star Fred.

- que:
  - Out where?
  ans:
  - Veil nebula.

- que:
  - Who cares?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure.

- que:
  - Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
  ans:
  - I need a diameter approximation.

- que:
  - You know what I think about, Talby?
  ans:
  - I'm getting something here, on this readout...

- que:
  - Yes, Talby, what is it?
  ans:
  - Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.

- que:
  - Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
  ans:
  - Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.

- que:
  - Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
  ans:
  - Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.

- que:
  - Guess you're right.
  ans:
  - What happened, Doolittle?

- que:
  - Phoenix?
  ans:
  - It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.

- que:
  - No kidding?
  ans:
  - I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.

- que:
  - Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
  ans:
  - Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.

- que:
  - Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. Negative effect.

- que:
  - What was that, Doolittle?
  ans:
  - Negative effect.

- que:
  - It didn't work?
  ans:
  - Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.

- que:
  - Commander? Are you still there?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Talk to the bomb.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Phenomenology...

- que:
  - Men... men... what happened, men?
  ans:
  - Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Bruno's girlfriend.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.

- que:
  - How I make my living, what's your point?
  ans:
  - This.

- que:
  - Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
  ans:
  - Yeah?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's not why we're here.

- que:
  - What're you talkin' about?
  ans:
  - That's a lotta crap.

- que:
  - How come I never hearda you before?
  ans:
  - I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent.

- que:
  - Who's Camille?
  ans:
  - None of your business.

- que:
  - You know each other?
  ans:
  - Nothing happened between me and Tia.

- que:
  - Can I say something in my defense?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - How're ya doin', Max.

- que:
  - Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?
  ans:
  - Justine was not an unwilling participant.

- que:
  - Do you know why I went after Justine?
  ans:
  - She was there...

- que:
  - Why would I be pissed?
  ans:
  - It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Police drone.

- que:
  - What? Where're we going?
  ans:
  - Lemme put some clothes on.

- que:
  - Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
  ans:
  - So you just decided to return it to the sender. Or, in this case, the sender's wife.

- que:
  - Where'd you clip this?
  ans:
  - I didn't. It was a present from a guy.

- que:
  - What're you looking for?
  ans:
  - A grand.

- que:
  - So Max, what do you do with all your money?
  ans:
  - They took my daughter.

- que:
  - Can you help me get her back?
  ans:
  - Look, I'd really like to...

- que:
  - If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
  ans:
  - We're not going that route. Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.

- que:
  - What else can we do?
  ans:
  - Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore.

- que:
  - Are we in some kind of trouble?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - What makes you cry?
  ans:
  - If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.

- que:
  - Mommy, where are you?
  ans:
  - Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Soon, baby.

- que:
  - You're a thief?
  ans:
  - Girl's gotta make a living.

- que:
  - So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
  ans:
  - No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.

- que:
  - Can we go somewhere and talk?
  ans:
  - Lemme get my coat.

- que:
  - How'd you find me?
  ans:
  - Wasn't that hard.

- que:
  - Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
  ans:
  - Now you know who I am, where I live. I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.

- que:
  - So now you tracked me down. What d'ya think?
  ans:
  - Too early to tell.

- que:
  - How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
  ans:
  - Lauren's not my wife.

- que:
  - Girlfriend?
  ans:
  - One of my sources. Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.

- que:
  - So what are you gonna do about it?
  ans:
  - Something.

- que:
  - Is the social studies class over for today?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
  ans:
  - I won't be staying.

- que:
  - Bent?
  ans:
  - Bent.

- que:
  - How do I know you didn't?
  ans:
  - So saw my hands off, I left you a present.

- que:
  - Am I s'posed to be grateful?
  ans:
  - That would be appropriate, yes.

- que:
  - How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
  ans:
  - You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.

- que:
  - Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
  ans:
  - Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.

- que:
  - The other ones?
  ans:
  - The other one like you...

- que:
  - Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
  ans:
  - The bar code on your neck, Max. I know who you are and I know who you're running from.

- que:
  - How much do you know?
  ans:
  - I know they made me. Even got the label on my neck to prove it.

- que:
  - What's in it for you?
  ans:
  - Your help.

- que:
  - She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers. You know who Sonrisa is?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I catch your hacks. He's Satan's lap dog, or something.

- que:
  - I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
  ans:
  - Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.

- que:
  - You believe that?
  ans:
  - Well, not me personally.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Open it.

- que:
  - Know where I can find her?
  ans:
  - You don't want to.

- que:
  - But she does work here?
  ans:
  - She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me. Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.

- que:
  - Any idea when she'll be back?
  ans:
  - None.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - A friend of your fiance's.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - My name's Lydia. And it seems you and I have a lot in common.

- que:
  - How do I know you're telling the truth?
  ans:
  - Look, I don't know what you want--

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.

- que:
  - My name's not kid. It's client. As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle. Now, you got something for me or not?
  ans:
  - Right here someplace.

- que:
  - Nothing on Hannah?
  ans:
  - Only a last name would be nice. Or the nearest town to this...clinic.

- que:
  - Whoever tossed this place wants you. And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
  ans:
  - What about the other kids? You get anything on them?

- que:
  - How's this about me?
  ans:
  - Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.

- que:
  - Hardware's too sophisticated. It's gotta be the government. And why do I think they're looking for you?
  ans:
  - You're crazy.

- que:
  - Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
  ans:
  - Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...

- que:
  - Got a pencil?
  ans:
  - Just give it to me. I'll remember.

- que:
  - Straight.
  ans:
  - No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?

- que:
  - Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
  ans:
  - Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.

- que:
  - Tell me the truth. Am I a female fog bank?
  ans:
  - You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.

- que:
  - A little what?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm saying.

- que:
  - How long you and me known each other?
  ans:
  - A long time.

- que:
  - Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
  ans:
  - Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - It's a secret.

- que:
  - Not right now? Okay, when?
  ans:
  - Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.

- que:
  - What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
  ans:
  - Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.

- que:
  - And she bought that?
  ans:
  - I have sincere eyes.

- que:
  - Can you put that in a bag or something?
  ans:
  - You get it when I get her.

- que:
  - It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
  ans:
  - You're the best, Maxie.

- que:
  - Playing hooky again?
  ans:
  - Feel like the dog's dinner.

- que:
  - What if he's on the level?
  ans:
  - Tell everybody hey.

- que:
  - Quitting time. Grab a cold one?
  ans:
  - I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh. I'd be pissed off too if I was her.

- que:
  - I'm the victim here.
  ans:
  - Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?

- que:
  - Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - Does this person have a name?
  ans:
  - Lydia.

- que:
  - And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
  ans:
  - I'm a toy to her.

- que:
  - A toy?
  ans:
  - She's as much as said so. But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.

- que:
  - What happens if you level with her?
  ans:
  - Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.

- que:
  - And why should she?
  ans:
  - So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.

- que:
  - How'd you get her out of town?
  ans:
  - Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.

- que:
  - And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
  ans:
  - I'll give it my best shot.

- que:
  - Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
  ans:
  - You don't.

- que:
  - What about this?
  ans:
  - I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - Gin.

- que:
  - Who's Whiskey Dick?
  ans:
  - Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.

- que:
  - You love him?
  ans:
  - I just told you, he's a big, hairy...

- que:
  - No, I mean... you love your son?
  ans:
  - More than anything in the world.

- que:
  - And he loves you back, doesn't he?
  ans:
  - He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.

- que:
  - You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
  ans:
  - Hawk.

- que:
  - You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
  ans:
  - Yeah, a man's drink...

- que:
  - You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
  ans:
  - Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.

- que:
  - Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
  ans:
  - I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.

- que:
  - Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
  ans:
  - Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.

- que:
  - That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
  ans:
  - I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.

- que:
  - You got in the car, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.

- que:
  - What are you, high?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
  ans:
  - Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.

- que:
  - Namely?
  ans:
  - Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.

- que:
  - What's in Sandusky?
  ans:
  - Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.

- que:
  - What was that D.J.'s name again?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...

- que:
  - Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.

- que:
  - Any luck?
  ans:
  - We are not stealing my mom's car.

- que:
  - And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
  ans:
  - Sunday, but...

- que:
  - Now, how are we gonna do this?
  ans:
  - Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.

- que:
  - No... You don't think...?
  ans:
  - Nah. Couldn't be.

- que:
  - Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
  ans:
  - Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.

- que:
  - How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
  ans:
  - The easy way.

- que:
  - Hawk?
  ans:
  - Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.

- que:
  - Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
  ans:
  - They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.

- que:
  - They're what?
  ans:
  - She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.

- que:
  - If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
  ans:
  - Check.

- que:
  - What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
  ans:
  - Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.

- que:
  - Jeremiah, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Uhh... nothing.

- que:
  - Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
  ans:
  - But, mom!

- que:
  - Grounded for the rest of the year?
  ans:
  - You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.

- que:
  - I said, I'm sorry!
  ans:
  - You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?

- que:
  - Mom, what're we...?
  ans:
  - Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.

- que:
  - Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
  ans:
  - Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?

- que:
  - Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
  ans:
  - Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Was it a teddy?
  ans:
  - No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.

- que:
  - A bustier?
  ans:
  - Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.

- que:
  - Let's lift up her shirt.
  ans:
  - That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?

- que:
  - Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
  ans:
  - Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.

- que:
  - Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
  ans:
  - Twenty-five more'n I got.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.

- que:
  - Two hundred bucks?
  ans:
  - You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.

- que:
  - VOICE Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
  ans:
  - COAT Oh, yeah! You and what army?

- que:
  - VOICE Is that your final answer?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Hi... what's going on here?
  ans:
  - Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - He got smooshed. By a jet engine.

- que:
  - What was his name?
  ans:
  - Donnie. Donnie Darko.

- que:
  - Dr. Monnitoff?
  ans:
  - Donnie.

- que:
  - I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
  ans:
  - So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.

- que:
  - So... that's it?
  ans:
  - Like a DeLorean.

- que:
  - What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
  ans:
  - Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.

- que:
  - Could these wormholes appear in nature?
  ans:
  - That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.

- que:
  - If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
  ans:
  - Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...

- que:
  - When can I squeeze one out?
  ans:
  - Not until like... eighth grade.

- que:
  - What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
  ans:
  - I didn't say shit.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Our saviour...

- que:
  - How can you do that?
  ans:
  - I can do anything I want... and so can you...

- que:
  - Why did you make me flood the school?
  ans:
  - We just want to guide you in the right direction.

- que:
  - Who is... we?
  ans:
  - You'll know soon enough.

- que:
  - Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
  ans:
  - I want to show you something.

- que:
  - You have a request?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.

- que:
  - Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
  ans:
  - Take it off. I want to see you.

- que:
  - What happened to your eye?
  ans:
  - I am so sorry.

- que:
  - Why do they call you Frank?
  ans:
  - It is the name of my father... and his father before me.

- que:
  - How much longer is this gonna last?
  ans:
  - You should already know that. Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.

- que:
  - My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna talk about it.

- que:
  - How old is Grandma Death?
  ans:
  - A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.

- que:
  - Wanna walk me home?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - So... you just moved here?
  ans:
  - Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems.

- que:
  - Oh, I... have those too. What kind of problems does your dad have?
  ans:
  - He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

- que:
  - Wow. Did he go to jail?
  ans:
  - He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.

- que:
  - What makes you think I'm not?
  ans:
  - I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.

- que:
  - You mean soap?
  ans:
  - Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - We never would have had this conversation.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm going home.

- que:
  - So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
  ans:
  - No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.

- que:
  - With, like, images?
  ans:
  - Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.

- que:
  - And what?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They suspended me for two days.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah. \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\". What is this?
  ans:
  - I know she's here. She never leaves the house.

- que:
  - What? How long was I asleep?
  ans:
  - The whole movie. Let's go.

- que:
  - Will you please talk to me?
  ans:
  - Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.

- que:
  - Hey. You OK?
  ans:
  - My mom is gone.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.

- que:
  - Did you call the cops?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There's something you have to know, Gretchen. Everything is going to be just fine.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.

- que:
  - Why? Is this about the book?
  ans:
  - No. Frank.

- que:
  - Is that a cellar door?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
  ans:
  - We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.

- que:
  - I wish I knew where you went at night. Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
  ans:
  - I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom. Get out of my room.

- que:
  - Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
  ans:
  - Grandma Death.

- que:
  - How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
  ans:
  - It feels wonderful.

- que:
  - So how was school today?
  ans:
  - Good Lord. So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.

- que:
  - So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
  ans:
  - You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.

- que:
  - Who's been giving you weird looks?
  ans:
  - A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason. But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.

- que:
  - Who is Frank?
  ans:
  - A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

- que:
  - Why should we care?
  ans:
  - Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.

- que:
  - What's \"Cellar Door\"?
  ans:
  - Cellar door.

- que:
  - So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
  ans:
  - I think I already have. But now she won't even talk to me.

- que:
  - Would you like to talk about this friend?
  ans:
  - His name is Frank.

- que:
  - Don't you watch the news?
  ans:
  - I don't own a television.

- que:
  - Follow him where?
  ans:
  - Into the future. Then he said that the world was coming to an end.

- que:
  - Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
  ans:
  - No. That's stupid.

- que:
  - And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is her name?
  ans:
  - Gretchen. We're going together now.

- que:
  - Do you think a lot about girls?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How are things going at school?
  ans:
  - I think about girls a lot.

- que:
  - Who is the boss?
  ans:
  - I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.

- que:
  - Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
  ans:
  - What about your family, Donnie?

- que:
  - How many times have you seen Frank?
  ans:
  - Four times... so far.

- que:
  - Can anyone else see him?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.

- que:
  - Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.

- que:
  - How does that make you feel?
  ans:
  - It reminded me of my dog Callie.

- que:
  - Is Callie still around?
  ans:
  - No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...

- que:
  - Do you feel alone right now?
  ans:
  - No. That makes you keep searching.

- que:
  - What did you find?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...

- que:
  - Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
  ans:
  - Whoa. That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.

- que:
  - And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
  ans:
  - I... I was playing with fire.

- que:
  - Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
  ans:
  - People get hurt.

- que:
  - Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
  ans:
  - They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.

- que:
  - What did you want for Christmas that year?
  ans:
  - Hungry Hungry Hippos.

- que:
  - How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
  ans:
  - Regret.

- que:
  - What else makes you feel regret?
  ans:
  - That I did it again.

- que:
  - You've done it again?
  ans:
  - Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.

- que:
  - If God exists?
  ans:
  - I think now that he might...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I'm so horny.

- que:
  - Where are we going, Donald?
  ans:
  - I have the power to build a time machine.

- que:
  - How is that possible?
  ans:
  - Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.

- que:
  - Then how is time travel possible?
  ans:
  - It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.

- que:
  - When will this happen?
  ans:
  - Soon. Time is almost up.

- que:
  - What is going to happen?
  ans:
  - Frank is going to kill.

- que:
  - Where is he, Donald?
  ans:
  - It's too late. I've already ruined my life.

- que:
  - Guess who wrote it?
  ans:
  - So I hear you have a girlfriend.

- que:
  - Why would I tell Mom?
  ans:
  - Because you tell Mom everything.

- que:
  - Excuse me? What's your name, son?
  ans:
  - Gerald.

- que:
  - Frank?
  ans:
  - Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.

- que:
  - You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
  ans:
  - He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.

- que:
  - I... What can we do?
  ans:
  - I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.

- que:
  - He was a year ahead of us?
  ans:
  - He died, remember? On the way to the prom. He was doomed.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Donnie? You're a dick.

- que:
  - Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
  ans:
  - That's enough.

- que:
  - I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
  ans:
  - No. I took a year off to be with you. Of course I care. Don't get angry. What?

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.

- que:
  - Christ. Is that an axe?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - How did this happen?
  ans:
  - I guess they made him do it.

- que:
  - Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
  ans:
  - I think we've all seen \"Bonanza\".

- que:
  - Beg pardon?
  ans:
  - But now you can't go.

- que:
  - What is this shit?
  ans:
  - Raspberry.

- que:
  - Is Mom okay?
  ans:
  - She's alive, sweetie.

- que:
  - So, what do I say?
  ans:
  - Oh my God. I'm so dead...

- que:
  - Really, Loretta?
  ans:
  - You-betcha.

- que:
  - My mom wanted me to have this?
  ans:
  - Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.

- que:
  - What is wrong with you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.

- que:
  - \"Here,\" wh-wh-what?
  ans:
  - My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.

- que:
  - Yah?
  ans:
  - Oh-you-beccha.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.

  - Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
  ans:
  - That's my mom. I'll get 'em in a sec.

- que:
  - We all do. Now let's go.
  ans:
  - No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?

- que:
  - Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
  ans:
  - Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.

- que:
  - But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
  ans:
  - Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.

- que:
  - You heard me. Where is it?
  ans:
  - If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.

- que:
  - So, anyone talk to Janelle?
  ans:
  - Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.

- que:
  - Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
  ans:
  - Yeah...

- que:
  - And the bite marks on my ears?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Are we on \"Cops\" again?
  ans:
  - You could be quiet.

  - Mm-hm.

- que:

  ans:
  - Wisconsin.

- que:
  - Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
  ans:
  - \"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!\" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.

- que:
  - GIRL Tammy Curry?
  ans:
  - 1 Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.

- que:
  - Lester?
  ans:
  - Oh, all right How soon they forget where all this comes from.

- que:
  - Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
  ans:
  - Iris, stop! It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.

- que:
  - Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
  ans:
  - Oh! What is it?

- que:
  - I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
  ans:
  - Uh, Gladys?

- que:
  - You get nothing, Hank, okay?

  ans:
  - \"My\"...

- que:
  - Now we're on the right track... Put back \"dear\"... How does it read?
  ans:
  - \"My dear\"...

- que:
  - Is that all?
  ans:
  - About - thirty-four seconds.

- que:
  - Who to?
  ans:
  - None of your business... Take another letter.

- que:
  - Yes -- why?
  ans:
  - I wanna powder my nose...

- que:
  - In her dressing room? Why, what could he be doing there?
  ans:
  - He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.

- que:
  - Half watch dog?
  ans:
  - Yeh, he's only got one eye.

- que:
  - I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash - Look - what do you call your dog?
  ans:
  - I don't call him, I whistle.

- que:
  - What do you whistle?
  ans:
  - Yankee Poodle.

- que:
  - I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging. What do you call your dog when you want him?
  ans:
  - I don't want him.

- que:
  - Oh no, I can't do it.
  ans:
  - Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?

- que:
  - You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
  ans:
  - Sure. How much does the job pay? Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.

- que:
  - You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
  ans:
  - At's-a no good. I went to Niagara Falls once.

  ans:
  - No, but I shot some ducks.

- que:
  - Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice -- I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
  ans:
  - That's no good. I like to work on the outside. I must have something easy.

- que:
  - Then you don't wanna work hard?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna work at all.

- que:
  - What do I get?
  ans:
  - You get half mine and I get half yours.

- que:
  - Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
  ans:
  - Sure, that's easy. You gotta insult somebody.

- que:
  - Why wasn't I insulted?
  ans:
  - You was insulted, but you don't know it.

- que:
  - Why didn't his niece slap your face?
  ans:
  - She did.

- que:
  - You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
  ans:
  - You told it to me.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
  ans:
  - I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.

- que:
  - Sure, we gotta have a spy. If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
  ans:

  - Well, we'll let that one go. Now -- how many battalions you got?
  ans:
  - We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.

  ans:
  - Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.

  ans:
  - Fine. We gotta him.

- que:
  - Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you. I want to hang it in my bedroom.
  ans:
  - How'm I doing, boss?

- que:
  - You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it. Where's my secretary?
  ans:
  - You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.

- que:
  - Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...

- que:
  - Are you getting tired?
  ans:
  - Not at all. When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.

- que:
  - Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum... I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
  ans:
  - Are you sure you're not tired?

- que:
  - Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
  ans:
  - What can this mug offer you? Wealth and family. I can't give you wealth... ...but we can have a little family of our own.

- que:
  - Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
  ans:
  - That's what you think.

- que:
  - Then it's war?
  ans:
  - Yes.

  - Nothing doing!! I've taken a lease on the battlefield. I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
  ans:
  - How're ya fixed for ammunition?

- que:
  - What I called you... Why, what did I call you?
  ans:
  - I don't remember.

  - Oh -- you mean... worm?
  ans:
  - No, that wasn't it...

- que:
  - Was it -- swine?
  ans:
  - No... it was a seven letter word.

- que:
  - You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack... Now what were you saying?
  ans:
  - In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well. I heartily endorse everything you stand for.

- que:
  - I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me. Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
  ans:
  - Why - er -- my husband passed away... I was with him to the very end.

  ans:

- que:
  - Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
  ans:
  - He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?

- que:
  - Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
  ans:
  - Why -- why -- of course.

- que:
  - WHAT ?
  ans:
  - I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.

- que:
  - Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
  ans:
  - The king can do no wrong!

- que:
  - Oh, would you...?
  ans:
  - For you, I would do anything...

- que:
  - Mr. Merrick, sugar?
  ans:
  - Yes please, two.

- que:
  - One or two?
  ans:
  - Two, please.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - And here is one of Frederick's mother.

- que:
  - You won't be long?
  ans:
  - I'll join you shortly.

- que:
  - Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
  ans:
  - No, I think a whiskey.

- que:
  - And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
  ans:
  - I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hmmm?
  ans:
  - ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.

- que:
  - Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
  ans:
  - That I am very little different from him.

- que:
  - ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
  ans:
  - Oh Frederick.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I found it.

- que:
  - Did you see it?
  ans:
  - Our man is sick. Come right away.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Like this.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - He fell. He falls.

- que:
  - I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
  ans:
  - Everything will be seen to.

- que:
  - Good morning, sir.
  ans:
  - Just a moment, how did you get in here?

- que:
  - You've acquired a taste for this?
  ans:
  - No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.

- que:
  - Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
  ans:
  - Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.

- que:
  - Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Oh, is he a friend of yours?
  ans:
  - No, more of an acquaintance.

- que:
  - Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
  ans:
  - Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.

- que:
  - A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
  ans:
  - Well sir, perhaps I should explain...

- que:
  - Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
  ans:
  - Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.

- que:
  - And what was that, John?
  ans:
  - It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.

- que:
  - Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
  ans:
  - Treves. Well done.

- que:
  - Can you imagine what his life has been like?
  ans:
  - Yes, I think I can.

- que:
  - Do you think they'll go along with us?
  ans:
  - Of course they will. They're reasonable men.

- que:
  - Has the response picked up?
  ans:
  - Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.

- que:
  - I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
  ans:
  - I feel much better. Thank you.

- que:
  - Are you comfortable here?
  ans:
  - Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.

- que:
  - Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
  ans:
  - ...everyone has been very kind.

- que:
  - What is it, Treves?
  ans:
  - Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...

- que:
  - How long has this man been here?
  ans:
  - Three quarters of an hour.

- que:
  - I say Freddie, what are you about?
  ans:
  - Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.

- que:
  - Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
  ans:
  - You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.

- que:
  - Nothing of any importance, eh?
  ans:
  - You never mentioned his mental state.

- que:
  - What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
  ans:
  - Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.

- que:
  - Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
  ans:
  - Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.

- que:
  - You've never been?
  ans:
  - Alas, no.

- que:
  - Have you read it?
  ans:
  - No, but I certainly shall.

- que:
  - Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  ans:
  - Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

- que:
  - Oh no?
  ans:
  - Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.

- que:
  - Is he... dying then?
  ans:
  - Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...

- que:
  - Want to come out?
  ans:
  - You're English.

- que:
  - Of course! You want out?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
  ans:
  - Where did you get this box?

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - The main spire.

- que:
  - The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
  ans:
  - Hello, my name is John Merrick.

- que:
  - Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
  ans:
  - Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.

- que:
  - Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
  ans:
  - You did not ask me.

- que:
  - Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
  ans:
  - Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.

- que:
  - This... is my new home?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How long will I stay here?
  ans:
  - You look splendid, John.

- que:
  - John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
  ans:
  - I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.

- que:
  - Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
  ans:
  - That's a canopy, John.

- que:
  - How is your tea, John?
  ans:
  - Not at all, John.

- que:
  - I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
  ans:
  - Oh yes.

  - Who are they of?
  ans:
  - Oh, our relatives... the children.

- que:
  - The children! May I see?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.

  - ...my... home?
  ans:
  - Yes, John.

- que:
  - You did this for me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is it the one you wanted?
  ans:
  - Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.

- que:
  - John.... how can you ever forgive me?
  ans:
  - Stand up, John. Let them see you.

- que:
  - Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
  ans:
  - Yes, very soon.

- que:
  - Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
  ans:
  - No, John, not one that I can see.

- que:
  - Then I shouldn't change anything?
  ans:
  - No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.

- que:
  - Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
  ans:
  - Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.

- que:
  - Won't come out, eh?
  ans:
  - No, he's very upset about something.

- que:
  - Yes sir. What's that?
  ans:
  - A dressing bag.

- que:
  - A dressing bag?
  ans:
  - You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.

- que:
  - WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
  ans:
  - I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.

- que:
  - Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
  ans:
  - Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.

- que:
  - YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
  ans:
  - Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - Never mind. I'm the owner.

- que:
  - So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
  ans:
  - Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.

- que:
  - Well... where is he?
  ans:
  - There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.

- que:
  - WHAT did you say?
  ans:
  - I said welcome.

- que:
  - WELCOME?
  ans:
  - Well, of course. We always welcome friends.

- que:
  - How d'you KNOW we're \"friends\"?
  ans:
  - Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.

- que:
  - What are what?
  ans:
  - Those things in your hands.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Put them down! PLEASE make them put them down.

- que:
  - WHY?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
  ans:
  - What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...

- que:
  - What was she like?
  ans:
  - Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...

- que:
  - That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
  ans:
  - Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?

- que:
  - Five this week; how many the week before?
  ans:
  - You're as bad as my father.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Halfdan the Black.

- que:
  - YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Do you believe I love you?
  ans:
  - I... but I...

- que:
  - You don't have to love me. Just, do you believe I love YOU?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I believe you do.

- que:
  - LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
  ans:
  - Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.

- que:
  - How do we know this is the way?
  ans:
  - We blew the Horn Resounding.

- que:
  - Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the \"Viking\"?
  ans:
  - I shouldn't have come.

- que:
  - What do you see, Erik?
  ans:
  - I see the world.

- que:
  - Is it night or day, Erik?
  ans:
  - It is day, of course, Freya.

- que:
  - Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
  ans:
  - The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.

- que:
  - Is there nothing men can do?
  ans:
  - That I cannot tell you.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...

- que:
  - Would you like us to sing to you?
  ans:
  - That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...

- que:
  - You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
  ans:
  - Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...

- que:
  - No... no... We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
  ans:
  - Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.

- que:
  - REALLY?
  ans:
  - Really.

- que:
  - And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well, how d'you think I feel?
  ans:
  - The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Careful! They're not supposed to hurt you.

- que:
  - I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Is there something the matter with it?
  ans:
  - Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.

- que:
  - Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing. You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes... oh, yes...

- que:
  - Have you done this sort of thing before?
  ans:
  - Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.

- que:
  - Looting and pillaging, eh?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What about the raping?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - No. It isn't rape then, is it?
  ans:
  - Oh, get it over with.

- que:
  - I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
  ans:
  - What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...

- que:
  - About raping me?
  ans:
  - About NOT raping you...

- que:
  - You DON'T like it, do you?
  ans:
  - Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.

- que:
  - What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.

- que:
  - Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
  ans:
  - To pay for the next expedition, of course.

- que:
  - You told them I raped you -- why?
  ans:
  - I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...

- que:
  - Tell me your name?
  ans:
  - I've come to take you back to the land of the living.

- que:
  - Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
  ans:
  - Well... no...

- que:
  - Is THAT Odin?
  ans:
  - But...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.

- que:
  - How deep IS the ocean?
  ans:
  - Very deep... usually...

- que:
  - What's wrong with making friends?
  ans:
  - We're missing all the fun...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...

- que:
  - Who have you been talking to?
  ans:
  - I met this girl...

- que:
  - So? What'd you do to her?
  ans:
  - I... I... KILLED her...

- que:
  - What are YOU doing here?
  ans:
  - You may need a real Berserk.

- que:
  - What \"magic\"?
  ans:
  - I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.

- que:
  - Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
  ans:
  - What \"magic\" have you brought, Erik?

- que:
  - Why should WE care?
  ans:
  - Because... you're... you're the Gods....

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.

- que:
  - You mean we'd be dead?
  ans:
  - Oh... I feel a little... oh...

- que:
  - Who gets killed?
  ans:
  - Nobody gets killed.

- que:
  - What's the matter with them?
  ans:
  - Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - But how could he know... unless...

- que:
  - And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
  ans:
  - I will join my grandfather there.

- que:
  - What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
  ans:
  - Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.

- que:
  - What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
  ans:
  - I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.

- que:
  - Hey, you two! What's going on?
  ans:
  - I was sitting there.

- que:
  - Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
  ans:
  - I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.

- que:
  - Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
  ans:
  - We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...

- que:
  - What d'you expect me to do?
  ans:
  - That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.

- que:
  - What's all the panic about?
  ans:
  - The Dragon...

- que:
  - What do we have to do?
  ans:
  - Nothing... I just immerse you in water...

- que:
  - Vanish into thin air?
  ans:
  - He hasn't.

- que:
  - Well, where is he then?
  ans:
  - You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.

- que:
  - Same thing, isn't it?
  ans:
  - No, it is NOT.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not.

- que:
  - How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
  ans:
  - I mean many of the greatest sailors were.

- que:
  - And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
  ans:
  - That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm not worth risking your life for.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...

- que:
  - What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
  ans:
  - Get away, Snorri.

- que:
  - What have you got there?
  ans:
  - Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.

- que:
  - Wasn't it, Keitel?
  ans:
  - Well... I... I thought...

- que:
  - And you've got BOTH axes?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mother.

- que:
  - And something to sharpen them with?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mum.

- que:
  - Who was the girl you walked off with?
  ans:
  - No one.

- que:
  - But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
  ans:
  - And I just liked you so much.

- que:
  - You did? You liked me?
  ans:
  - No, it was lovely.

- que:
  - May I help you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.

- que:
  - Ms. Kruczynski?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - How are you today?
  ans:
  - Okay, I guess.

- que:
  - Come over after I'm done here?
  ans:
  - I can't. I want to, but I have to study.

- que:
  - In the room?
  ans:
  - In the world.

- que:
  - Oh, baby, what's going on?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.

- que:
  - I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
  ans:
  - Come up to Boston with me?

- que:
  - What's wrong with me?
  ans:
  - Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

- que:
  - How are you today?
  ans:
  - Okay, I guess.

- que:
  - Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
  ans:
  - Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

- que:
  - You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
  ans:
  - What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.

- que:
  - Why what?
  ans:
  - Why are you sorry? I just said hi.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Well, I didn't want to assume.

- que:
  - Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
  ans:
  - Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me, book slave there for, like, five years now.

- que:
  - Ah, the hair. Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
  ans:
  - I can't remember.

- que:
  - You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
  ans:
  - Oh, I doubt that's the case.

- que:
  - Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
  ans:
  - Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.

- que:
  - Huckleberry Hound?
  ans:
  - I don't know what that means.

- que:
  - Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
  ans:
  - I'm not nuts.

- que:
  - Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means \"merciful\", right?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

- que:
  - Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
  ans:
  - Why wouldn't you think that about me?

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.

- que:
  - You're not a stalker or anything, right?
  ans:
  - Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.

- que:
  - You know Wilmont?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So you like bookstores, huh?
  ans:
  - Sort of, um...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm just a bit of a wreck. \"I sleep in your hat\" makes me cry. Me.

- que:
  - You like that?
  ans:
  - Very much.

- que:
  - Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Frost?
  ans:
  - It's pretty.

- que:
  - Ready for another?
  ans:
  - No, I'm okay for now.

- que:
  - What do you want to hear?
  ans:
  - You pick it.

- que:
  - Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
  ans:
  - No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill?

- que:
  - Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.

- que:
  - Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
  ans:
  - No, not at all.

- que:
  - You'll call me, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.

- que:
  - How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
  ans:
  - You didn't say anything about my hair.

- que:
  - No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
  ans:
  - Let me drive you home.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

- que:
  - Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?
  ans:
  - I want to have a baby.

- que:
  - Would you get me another, Joely?
  ans:
  - You're drunk.

- que:
  - More?
  ans:
  - No. Thanks.

- que:
  - Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
  ans:
  - I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.

- que:
  - Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in? And we can hide there till morning.

- que:
  - They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
  ans:
  - Really? Is he cute?

- que:
  - Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
  ans:
  - This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.

- que:
  - Do you remember what we talked about?
  ans:
  - Naomi, I guess.

- que:
  - What was I wearing?
  ans:
  - God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.

- que:
  - Egad, were you horrified?
  ans:
  - No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.

- que:
  - Is that what you want?
  ans:
  - I did it. I guess that means something.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I'd like to... take you out or something.

- que:
  - I had you pegged, didn't I?
  ans:
  - You had the whole human race pegged.

- que:
  - Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
  ans:
  - And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.

- que:
  - You mean, like... Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
  ans:
  - Yeah, like that.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - Enjoy it. Say good-bye.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - I'll give you a couple. See what you think.

- que:
  - Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
  ans:
  - I think, before.

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah. It goes \"Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines\"?
  ans:
  - Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don't live.

- que:
  - I wish we did. You married?
  ans:
  - Um, no.

- que:
  - Male or female?
  ans:
  - Female.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It's freezing out here.

- que:
  - Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
  ans:
  - Naomi.

- que:
  - What if you stay this time?
  ans:
  - I walked out the door. There's no more memory.

- que:
  - So you'll call me, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.

- que:
  - What if?
  ans:
  - I think I should go back.

- que:
  - Says you were a bully...
  ans:
  - Listen, did you want to make love?

- que:
  - A bully? Moi?
  ans:
  - That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.

- que:
  - What took you so long?
  ans:
  - I just walked in.

- que:
  - Hmmm. Do you miss me?
  ans:
  - Oddly enough, I do.

- que:
  - Did you send this? Is it a joke?
  ans:
  - I probably got the same thing as you.

- que:
  - I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
  ans:
  - Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.

- que:
  - Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
  ans:
  - I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.

- que:
  - How's it going?
  ans:
  - Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.

- que:
  - Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
  ans:
  - I just got in.

- que:
  - Any messages, Carmen?
  ans:
  - Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...

- que:
  - Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
  ans:
  - She's so sexy.

- que:
  - So you're still on the Zoloft?
  ans:
  - Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.

- que:
  - Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
  ans:
  - Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.

- que:
  - Yours?
  ans:
  - You take it. I don't know.

- que:
  - So what's going on, Joel?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.

- que:
  - Hi.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - How was it?
  ans:
  - You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.

- que:
  - So you don't mind?
  ans:
  - I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

- que:
  - So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
  ans:
  - It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.

- que:
  - So you think the dissertation will get published?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.

- que:
  - Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
  ans:
  - Nah, I don't know.

- que:
  - I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Cool.

- que:
  - Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?
  ans:
  - We haven't checked.

- que:
  - Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - You love him, don't you?
  ans:
  - It's stopped.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Listen, it's not erasing.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He's not on the map.

- que:
  - This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
  ans:
  - Well, what should we do?

- que:
  - He's coming?
  ans:
  - You better go.

- que:
  - Do you swear you didn't know?
  ans:
  - I swear.

- que:
  - And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
  ans:
  - Once, maybe.

- que:
  - How did I look?
  ans:
  - Happy. Happy with a secret.

- que:
  - And after that?
  ans:
  - I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Then why did you ask me?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.

- que:
  - Cole slaw, ice tea?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.

- que:
  - Alexander Pope?
  ans:
  - It's no big deal.

- que:
  - Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
  ans:
  - I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.

- que:
  - Thanks. So... do we talk about this... or what?
  ans:
  - I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.

- que:
  - Stan? What's going on?
  ans:
  - The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.

- que:
  - Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
  ans:
  - I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.

- que:
  - Well, where was Patrick?
  ans:
  - He went home sick.

- que:
  - Mary. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - She came to help, Howard.

- que:
  - Did you try going through C-Gate?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Of course.

- que:
  - Does that help?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Just wanted to let you know.

- que:
  - Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
  ans:
  - It's a quote book.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Clockworks.

- que:
  - Siwash, huh?
  ans:
  - But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe.... ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

- que:
  - What do you believe in then?
  ans:
  - Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

- que:
  - Is everything getting worse?
  ans:
  - She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.

- que:
  - You mean she's dead?
  ans:
  - But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.

- que:
  - How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
  ans:
  - That's your problem.

- que:
  - Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
  ans:
  - I'm staying with the Countess.

- que:
  - I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
  ans:
  - I don't.

- que:
  - You don't?
  ans:
  - Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.

- que:
  - A traveler, eh?
  ans:
  - You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.

- que:
  - Where are the others?
  ans:
  - Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.

- que:
  - Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
  ans:
  - Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.

- que:
  - You don't agree with Debbie, then?
  ans:
  - That's Jellybean!

- que:
  - How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
  ans:
  - Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Well.... er...

- que:
  - Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
  ans:
  - Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.

- que:
  - Whose fault was that?
  ans:
  - I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.

- que:
  - What guy?
  ans:
  - I'm cold.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Getting dressed. I've got to go.

- que:
  - Going north?
  ans:
  - You bet your raggedy white ass I am.

- que:
  - Are you in show business?
  ans:
  - I was a successful model once.

- que:
  - For magazines?
  ans:
  - I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.

- que:
  - So now you're bummin' around?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Hitchhiking?
  ans:
  - I'm the best.

- que:
  - You're the best?
  ans:
  - Whooee!

- que:
  - Bonanza Jellybean?
  ans:
  - What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.

- que:
  - A job for me?
  ans:
  - I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.

- que:
  - If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
  ans:
  - Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.

- que:
  - But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...

- que:
  - I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
  ans:
  - Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.

- que:
  - So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
  ans:
  - You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.

- que:
  - ...do you copy?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.

- que:
  - Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - Holy shit...

- que:
  - Justin?
  ans:
  - I think I found something...

- que:
  - EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
  ans:
  - This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?

- que:
  - You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
  ans:
  - ...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...

- que:
  - Will it work?
  ans:
  - It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.

- que:
  - You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
  ans:
  - I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You heard me. This ship, it's crazy, trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.

- que:
  - Roger that.
  ans:
  - What about the accumulator...?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Coffee.

- que:
  - Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
  ans:
  - It is not.

- que:
  - How? The Bridge is gone.
  ans:
  - What's happening?

- que:
  - Can you shut it down?
  ans:
  - I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...

- que:
  - No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
  ans:
  - What...?

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.

- que:
  - \"Another man?\" Who?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.

- que:
  - \"Save yourself. From Hell.\" What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
  ans:
  - DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing. It's nothing.

- que:
  - I've got a pulse, he's alive...
  ans:
  - What's happening...?

- que:
  - Pressure?
  ans:
  - 90 over 50 and falling... .

- que:
  - Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.

- que:
  - You're not seriously considering sending him?
  ans:
  - The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.

- que:
  - What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it. And then there's his wife.

- que:
  - I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
  ans:
  - The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.

- que:
  - What, Justin, what shows you?
  ans:
  - It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...

- que:
  - What does?
  ans:
  - The dark inside me.

- que:
  - How do you know all this?
  ans:
  - But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...

- que:
  - The crew? Could they still be alive?
  ans:
  - The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.

- que:
  - What's the hold up?
  ans:
  - Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers. Good for four months.

- que:
  - So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
  ans:
  - Peters is right, no one's here.

- que:
  - Starck, you still showing those readings?
  ans:
  - The blood came from somewhere, Peters...

- que:
  - What you got, Peters?
  ans:
  - Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.

- que:
  - Alive?
  ans:
  - Frozen.

- que:
  - ...how's the client?
  ans:
  - Crystallized.

- que:
  - ...you okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.

- que:
  - Where has it been for the last seven years?
  ans:
  - That's what we're here to find out.

- que:
  - What does it say?
  ans:
  - NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...

- que:
  - I can see that, what're they for?
  ans:
  - Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.

- que:
  - Any survivors?
  ans:
  - Negative.

- que:
  - No one?
  ans:
  - They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.

- que:
  - What could cause them? What's in the Core?
  ans:
  - It's complicated...

- que:
  - How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now, what is in the Core?
  ans:
  - It's insane.

- que:
  - You have something, Dr. Weir?
  ans:
  - The date.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.

- que:
  - What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
  ans:
  - You said this ship creates a gateway...

- que:
  - To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - Where has it been for the past seven years?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - The \"Other Place,\" what is that...?
  ans:
  - I DON'T KNOW! I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.

- que:
  - What about my ship?
  ans:
  - You... You can't do that!

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.

- que:
  - What makes you think I'll miss?
  ans:
  - Weir is dead.

- que:
  - What are you?
  ans:
  - Locked and cocked.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Heading three-three-four...

- que:
  - I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
  ans:
  - 1500 meters. We're getting too close...

- que:
  - Starck...
  ans:
  - Where is it?

- que:
  - Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
  ans:
  - Love to.

- que:
  - Do we have enough time for a weld?
  ans:
  - We don't have time to fart.

- que:
  - No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
  ans:
  - They're gone.

- que:
  - I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
  ans:
  - I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.

- que:
  - What is it, Smith?
  ans:
  - I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.

- que:
  - Come again, Skipper?
  ans:
  - One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.

- que:
  - Justin?
  ans:
  - Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.

- que:
  - Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
  ans:
  - I just finished drying...

- que:
  - Radiation interference?
  ans:
  - There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.

- que:
  - Everybody okay?
  ans:
  - We're all here.

- que:
  - How much oh-two do we have?
  ans:
  - Oxygen is not the problem.

- que:
  - Carbon dioxide?
  ans:
  - It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.

- que:
  - What's causing the readings?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.

- que:
  - So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
  ans:
  - What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...

- que:
  - Maybe one of the original crew?
  ans:
  - No. It was someone else.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...

- que:
  - What is it, Starck?
  ans:
  - ...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...

- que:
  - \"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,\" don't you have anything useful to tell me?
  ans:
  - I've got a theory.

- que:
  - To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
  ans:
  - I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...

- que:
  - If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
  ans:
  - I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.

- que:
  - What's going on in there, Starck?
  ans:
  - Justin's in the airlock.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.

- que:
  - Blow it up?
  ans:
  - We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...

- que:
  - First time in a grav couch?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - He's been past Mars?
  ans:
  - He served on the Goliath.

- que:
  - Wasn't that ship destroyed?
  ans:
  - Claire...

- que:
  - Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
  ans:
  - Blood. Looks like arterial spray.

- que:
  - Can you see a body?
  ans:
  - There's no one here.

- que:
  - Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
  ans:
  - I've seen bodies before. This is different.

- que:
  - Can you shut it down?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.

- que:
  - Do you know what it was?
  ans:
  - Almost got it.

- que:
  - You got any coffee?
  ans:
  - It's cold.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Dead ahead, 5000 meters.

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - That's the Core, the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.

- que:
  - What happened to his eyes?
  ans:
  - Explosive decompression.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - A straight line.

- que:
  - Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
  ans:
  - If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Ship's log.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.

- que:
  - Claire is your wife?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It wants me. I have to go.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The forward airlock.

- que:
  - Justin said something about, \"The dark inside me...\" What did he mean?
  ans:
  - It means nothing.

- que:
  - I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
  ans:
  - I'm not really dressed for a party.

- que:
  - Those yours too?
  ans:
  - My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.

- que:
  - Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave?
  ans:
  - I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

- que:
  - Is it safe?
  ans:
  - I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.

- que:
  - Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
  ans:
  - You look like an eighties rock band.

- que:
  - Where is Reed?
  ans:
  - Victor must've taken him.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm worried about you.

- que:
  - What is this? Where's Reed?
  ans:
  - Where do you think? With Sue.

- que:
  - What do you want, Vic?
  ans:
  - I'll be watching over you.

- que:
  - Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said \"together forever no matter what\"?
  ans:
  - Baby, you're scaring me.

- que:
  - Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
  ans:
  - Deb, it's me. It's still me.

- que:
  - What did you wish for, honey?
  ans:
  - I already got it. Everything I want.

- que:
  - What about his first born?
  ans:
  - Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.

- que:
  - When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
  ans:
  - Five times.

- que:
  - Isn't that your speech?
  ans:
  - He's made a few changes.

- que:
  - Should?
  ans:
  - I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.

- que:
  - Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Solid.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.

- que:
  - You got a chisel round here?
  ans:
  - If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

- que:
  - Where... where am I?
  ans:
  - Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.

- que:
  - Reed?... Sue?
  ans:
  - They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.

- que:
  - That's terrible news...
  ans:
  - What's wrong with me?

- que:
  - I mean, you feel a little feverish.
  ans:
  - And where do we think we're going?

- que:
  - Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
  ans:
  - I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?

- que:
  - Now what is up with that?
  ans:
  - The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.

- que:
  - Ben, are you there?
  ans:
  - This is wrong in so many ways.

- que:
  - This place is deluxe. You got cable?
  ans:
  - ...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

- que:
  - A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
  ans:
  - I think that thing is Ben.

- que:
  - Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
  ans:
  - Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.

- que:
  - Is that what you call it? \"Real\"?
  ans:
  - At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

- que:
  - And if he's not...?
  ans:
  - Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...

- que:
  - Leonard, how's the feed?
  ans:
  - Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.

- que:
  - Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar \"humanizes\" you.
  ans:
  - How's the IPO?

- que:
  - Front page?
  ans:
  - Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.

- que:
  - Feeling better?
  ans:
  - Passion.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We need to get past them.

- que:
  - How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
  ans:
  - That's what we're here to find out.

- que:
  - Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - No, I distinctly remember, you walked out my door. Ergo...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

- que:
  - But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
  ans:
  - Of course. Of course.

- que:
  - Reed. How close are we to a cure?
  ans:
  - No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.

- que:
  - You were?
  ans:
  - Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

- que:
  - You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
  ans:
  - I gave him twenty.

- que:
  - Why didn't you say something?
  ans:
  - That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.

- que:
  - This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Hilarious.

- que:
  - Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
  ans:
  - Ben did this.

- que:
  - Ben did this?
  ans:
  - He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.

- que:
  - I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
  ans:
  - What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.

- que:
  - Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
  ans:
  - I understand the business reasons.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Raising the shields.

- que:
  - Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
  ans:
  - If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.

- que:
  - Arnold. What's happening?
  ans:
  - Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.

- que:
  - You want to work at Carl's?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - How much did they cost?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
  ans:
  - Go ahead. Just make it quick.

- que:
  - Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
  ans:
  - Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.

- que:
  - Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? Please, Brad?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.

- que:
  - Why can't you do it?
  ans:
  - Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.

- que:
  - Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
  ans:
  - They're not home yet.

- que:
  - I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
  ans:
  - I'll explain everything later.

- que:
  - Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
  ans:
  - It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.

- que:
  - Is everything okay at work?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.

- que:
  - You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
  ans:
  - I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.

- que:
  - Where did you hear that?
  ans:
  - I'm just guessing.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's just Linda. And Mark from school.

- que:
  - Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
  ans:
  - Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...

- que:
  - You're not going to tell me, are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Any problems?
  ans:
  - No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.

- que:
  - Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
  ans:
  - They were left over from the last shift.

- que:
  - Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
  ans:
  - He insulted me first. He called me a moron.

- que:
  - Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
  ans:
  - Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.

- que:
  - O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
  ans:
  - I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.

- que:
  - You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
  ans:
  - Mark is a really nice boy...

- que:
  - Do you have any ice tea?
  ans:
  - Sure. Come on in.

- que:
  - I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
  ans:
  - I know what I look like.

- que:
  - Do you want to take a quick swim?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - Are you really a virgin?
  ans:
  - Come on...

- que:
  - Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
  ans:
  - You first.

- que:
  - How about both of us at the same time?
  ans:
  - I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.

- que:
  - What? Are you all right?
  ans:
  - I think we're making a lot of noise.

- que:
  - I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
  ans:
  - I guess I did.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.

- que:
  - Why don't you call me up tonight?
  ans:
  - Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.

- que:
  - We've got to get an abortion?
  ans:
  - Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.

- que:
  - Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
  ans:
  - Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.

- que:
  - All right... where did you see her?
  ans:
  - She's in my biology class.

- que:
  - Did you get her number?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you get her name?
  ans:
  - No. It's too soon.

- que:
  - You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
  ans:
  - Okay. Okay. Here's what you do.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Ace the jacket.

- que:
  - Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
  ans:
  - All right. Pay attention.

- que:
  - Mark. What happened to your date?
  ans:
  - It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.

- que:
  - Damone, are you there?
  ans:
  - I'm really pretty busy...

- que:
  - I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
  ans:
  - No Damone. I don't understand.

- que:
  - Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
  ans:
  - Jesus. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Sensitive -- what is that?
  ans:
  - Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.

- que:
  - So what makes you so sensitive?
  ans:
  - Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.

- que:
  - What do you read? What's the last book you read?
  ans:
  - Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.

- que:
  - Are you Linda Barrett?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And they don't call my parents?
  ans:
  - Not if you're over sixteen.

- que:
  - How've you been?
  ans:
  - Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.

- que:
  - How often do you go?
  ans:
  - I don't go at all.

- que:
  - Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
  ans:
  - Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - That's me, Merv.

- que:
  - Are you going to ride that wave?
  ans:
  - Totally.

- que:
  - What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
  ans:
  - Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.

- que:
  - Naw. Any good?
  ans:
  - Suzanne Somers' tits.

- que:
  - What the fuck is this guy doing?
  ans:
  - This ain't no cop.

- que:
  - Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
  ans:
  - First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.

- que:
  - Don't you like him?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.

- que:
  - So what did you do?
  ans:
  - I can't do that.

- que:
  - He was hot, wasn't he?
  ans:
  - If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.

- que:
  - Do you think guys find that attractive?
  ans:
  - Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.

- que:
  - What variables?
  ans:
  - Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

- que:
  - What's the big deal?
  ans:
  - Well I never did it.

- que:
  - Was it great?
  ans:
  - It was okay.

- que:
  - So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
  ans:
  - Come on, Linda. It's just sex.

- que:
  - Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
  ans:
  - Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.

- que:
  - Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
  ans:
  - I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.

- que:
  - Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
  ans:
  - Sixteen.

- que:
  - Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
  ans:
  - Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?

- que:
  - Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
  ans:
  - You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.

- que:
  - Does that ever happen?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.

- que:
  - What's Doug do in Chicago?
  ans:
  - He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think they're both virgins.

- que:
  - I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
  ans:
  - God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.

- que:
  - What do you think it is?
  ans:
  - It couldn't be.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want romance.

- que:
  - Where's Doug?
  ans:
  - He's not coming.

- que:
  - Not coming? What happened?
  ans:
  - He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes.

- que:
  - Sometime?
  ans:
  - Yeah, like maybe never.

- que:
  - But what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Well I might go to Dartmouth.

- que:
  - I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
  ans:
  - There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.

- que:
  - What class?
  ans:
  - This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.

- que:
  - Can I come in?
  ans:
  - Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.

- que:
  - Mr. Spicoli?
  ans:
  - That's the name they gave me.

- que:
  - Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy?
  ans:
  - I couldn't make it in time.

- que:
  - You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
  ans:
  - I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.

- que:
  - Food will be eaten on your time! Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - Learning about Cuba. Having some food.

- que:
  - Mr... Mr. Hand.
  ans:
  - I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?

- que:
  - Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
  ans:
  - Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.

- que:
  - Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I guess so.

- que:
  - Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
  ans:
  - Well, you'll find out next year.

- que:
  - How about your phone number?
  ans:
  - Thanks for picking me up.

- que:
  - Where do you feel like going?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Wherever you want.

- que:
  - How about the point?
  ans:
  - The point sounds fine.

- que:
  - Are you really nineteen?
  ans:
  - Yes... I am really nineteen.

- que:
  - What about those other guys you live with?
  ans:
  - No. I mean back to your home.

- que:
  - Is this your first time?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
  ans:
  - We keep them.

- que:
  - My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
  ans:
  - Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.

- que:
  - Do you have Mrs. George for English?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She is pretty good.

- que:
  - Do you know what you want?
  ans:
  - I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Aren't your parents asleep?
  ans:
  - No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.

- que:
  - I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
  ans:
  - No. That's okay.

- que:
  - Thanks. So... What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

- que:
  - Do you really have to go?
  ans:
  - Well... it's getting kind of late.

- que:
  - Where's Mike today?
  ans:
  - Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.

- que:
  - What's April 16th?
  ans:
  - It's John Bonham's birthday.

- que:
  - John Bonham?
  ans:
  - Oh. I see.

- que:
  - What about the notes?
  ans:
  - I'll get you the notes.

- que:
  - Hi, Stacy. How are you?
  ans:
  - Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.

- que:
  - Are you ready to order here?
  ans:
  - Well... sure. She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.

- que:
  - Anything to drink?
  ans:
  - Two Cokes.

- que:
  - I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
  ans:
  - Yes... It makes sense.

- que:
  - Awake? What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.

- que:
  - But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
  ans:
  - The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...

- que:
  - Crying? Why was she crying?
  ans:
  - Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...

- que:
  - What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
  ans:
  - Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.

- que:
  - Naked!?
  ans:
  - Naked.

- que:
  - WHAT?
  ans:
  - Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...

- que:
  - And nobody did anything?
  ans:
  - Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.

- que:
  - Where ya comin' from, young man?
  ans:
  - Las Vegas.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.

- que:
  - Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
  ans:
  - It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.

- que:
  - Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
  ans:
  - The medicine? Yes, it's right here.

- que:
  - Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
  ans:
  - You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!

- que:
  - How long do I have?
  ans:
  - Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.

- que:
  - But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
  ans:
  - No, no. Don't leave me!

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - That's good...

- que:
  - Why what?
  ans:
  - Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.

- que:
  - Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
  ans:
  - Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.

- que:
  - Not much. Why?
  ans:
  - I have to go.

- que:
  - GO?
  ans:
  - Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.

- que:
  - Can we make it?
  ans:
  - That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.

- que:
  - When does this thing stop?
  ans:
  - It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.

- que:
  - Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
  ans:
  - Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.

- que:
  - What limes?
  ans:
  - They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.

- que:
  - Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
  ans:
  - Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.

- que:
  - What tape?
  ans:
  - Jefferson Airplane. \"White Rabbit.\" I want a rising sound.

- que:
  - How about a check?
  ans:
  - Whatever's right.

- que:
  - You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - Lucy.

- que:
  - What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
  ans:
  - It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.

- que:
  - Us?
  ans:
  - Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.

- que:
  - Where'd you get this?
  ans:
  - Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

- que:
  - Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
  ans:
  - Some of what?

- que:
  - FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
  ans:
  - So do we, lady.

- que:
  - Do you think you can handle it?
  ans:
  - Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.

- que:
  - How much is the lemon meringue pie?
  ans:
  - Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.

- que:
  - Could I have that, please?
  ans:
  - Why not? It was getting warm anyway.

- que:
  - Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
  ans:
  - I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.

- que:
  - Part of what?
  ans:
  - One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.

- que:
  - Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
  ans:
  - Um, yeah, thirty miles east.

- que:
  - We'll meet in three hours?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...

- que:
  - Where are you two going?
  ans:
  - We're going to get my little girl.

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - Where is everyone?

- que:
  - IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
  ans:
  - Nah, I got the gun.

- que:
  - My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
  ans:
  - Her fella.

- que:
  - Gonna stay for a couple?
  ans:
  - I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.

- que:
  - Who the hell would you call?
  ans:
  - Anyone.

- que:
  - Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
  ans:
  - We shot a skunk.

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.

- que:
  - And the rest of 'em?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.

- que:
  - So, your husband ditched you?
  ans:
  - No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran. He just ran.

- que:
  - What tunnel? Where?
  ans:
  - It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.

- que:
  - What's it for?
  ans:
  - HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.

- que:
  - You all sure about this?
  ans:
  - Follow me.

- que:
  - Where's the tunnel?
  ans:
  - Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look.

- que:
  - That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
  ans:
  - Just an observation.

- que:
  - Why don't you go check it out?
  ans:
  - Fuck no.

- que:
  - Any more ideas Animal Planet?
  ans:
  - You weren't helpin'.

- que:
  - Oh yeah?
  ans:
  - Well then I guess we should just give up.

- que:
  - He's dead.
  ans:
  - Who's with me?

- que:
  - What now, Geronimo?
  ans:
  - My truck.

- que:
  - Why do you take shit from him?
  ans:
  - Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.

- que:
  - Your brother, huh?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Your parents of relation?
  ans:
  - We lived near power lines.

- que:
  - Anyone else?
  ans:
  - We're going to get help.

- que:
  - Anybody else?
  ans:
  - We gotta be close.

- que:
  - My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What's in the back?
  ans:
  - Nothing, this was my last delivery.

- que:
  - But not flush against the tunnel?
  ans:
  - It's imperative that you get that truck moving.

- que:
  - How are you holding up?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - Magic potion. You should try a little.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.

- que:
  - Will I go crazy or something?
  ans:
  - No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.

- que:
  - Why not then?
  ans:
  - Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.

- que:
  - Doesn't your foot hurt?
  ans:
  - I can't feel a thing, Hon.

- que:
  - You wanna see, baby?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How much you got to see the show?
  ans:
  - You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.

- que:
  - What? Really?
  ans:
  - Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.

- que:
  - Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.

- que:
  - So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
  ans:
  - He only shot you once.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - He shot you the other time.

- que:
  - Will these boards hold?
  ans:
  - Good.

- que:
  - What's going on between you two?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What's it for!?
  ans:
  - Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.

- que:
  - Is it gassed up?
  ans:
  - Fully.

- que:
  - Four door?
  ans:
  - Two.

- que:
  - Open?
  ans:
  - Covered.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - Holds four.

- que:
  - Max?
  ans:
  - Seven.

- que:
  - Nine?
  ans:
  - Seven.

- que:
  - What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
  ans:
  - Get outta here.

- que:
  - Oh? And what's that?
  ans:
  - Sit still, look less like a meal.

- que:
  - Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
  ans:
  - Bullshit.

- que:
  - Eh, Chief?
  ans:
  - Duh hickey.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.

- que:
  - Get something on that.
  ans:
  - Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?

- que:
  - There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
  ans:
  - You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.

- que:
  - You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
  ans:
  - I'm sure.

- que:
  - Am I too heavy for you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'll go.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing, just lookin'.

- que:
  - If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
  ans:
  - She's not very nice, is she?

- que:
  - Oh my God... What is that?
  ans:
  - That's one piece of four problems.

- que:
  - We all have to be strong, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
  ans:
  - Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.

- que:
  - Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
  ans:
  - Um, well...

- que:
  - Are you lying to me?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - What did we say about lying?
  ans:
  - I'm not lying.

- que:
  - You know that no one likes a liar, right?
  ans:
  - I said I'm not lying.

- que:
  - What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
  ans:
  - I just hit it like you said.

- que:
  - Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me, improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
  ans:
  - You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.

- que:
  - So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
  ans:
  - Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - Putting on my armor.

- que:
  - Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
  ans:
  - Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.

- que:
  - Forgive'...? For What?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.

- que:
  - Excuse me, sir?
  ans:
  - Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.

- que:
  - Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
  ans:
  - I guess so, sir.

- que:
  - Hi Frances, got a minute?
  ans:
  - Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.

- que:
  - That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
  ans:
  - My clothes?

- que:
  - Good, good. Give them that.
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?

- que:
  - Madam...?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Who is she?
  ans:
  - I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.

- que:
  - Where's Clifford?
  ans:
  - He's not here.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.

- que:
  - You don't think I'm good enough?
  ans:
  - What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Right now we have to be practical.

- que:
  - Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
  ans:
  - He knows, Frances.

- que:
  - Hey, where's the fire, sister?
  ans:
  - In my eyes, officer.

- que:
  - Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
  ans:
  - I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.

- que:
  - You learn your lines?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - Fired?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.

- que:
  - There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
  ans:
  - ...Yes.

- que:
  - Dick...
  ans:
  - You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?

- que:
  - I gotta go now.
  ans:
  - No?

- que:
  - We're all square now, Harry. Right?
  ans:
  - All square, Doc.

- que:
  - ...Don't you?
  ans:
  - No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.

- que:
  - You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
  ans:
  - Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.

- que:
  - One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
  ans:
  - Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.

- que:
  - Thank you.
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
  ans:
  - ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...

- que:
  - Were you an alcoholic?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Were you a drug addict?
  ans:
  - No. Never.

- que:
  - Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
  ans:
  - He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.

- que:
  - Is Kaminski a Communist?
  ans:
  - No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.

- que:
  - He's a socialist, then?
  ans:
  - It's already started, Dad... with me.

- que:
  - You really want to go?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - And you think it's worth all this?
  ans:
  - If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.

- que:
  - ...So what do you think?
  ans:
  - I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.

- que:
  - Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
  ans:
  - Always. Always.

- que:
  - Bread?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
  ans:
  - You're poisoning that child's mind.

- que:
  - See you next weekend?
  ans:
  - Fifteen.

- que:
  - I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
  ans:
  - You can always come see it in London.

- que:
  - Only if you were in it. Are you?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't miss it.

- que:
  - Are you really serious? About acting?
  ans:
  - Why... yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.

- que:
  - Aren't you ever going back?
  ans:
  - ...Not if I can help it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.

- que:
  - Okay then...
  ans:
  - What is this?

- que:
  - Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
  ans:
  - Not me. But other people seem to.

- que:
  - Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
  ans:
  - No... Actually, you look more like a cop.

- que:
  - I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
  ans:
  - Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.

- que:
  - Harry.
  ans:
  - Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?

- que:
  - Well? What'd you think?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to see how you looked.

- que:
  - How'd I look?
  ans:
  - Enh.

- que:
  - You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
  ans:
  - Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Quietly.

- que:
  - What happened to him?
  ans:
  - He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well... don't you think it's up to me to...

- que:
  - Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
  ans:
  - Came to get a tan.

- que:
  - Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
  ans:
  - Kaminski.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They killed him. They threw him out that window.

- que:
  - But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
  ans:
  - You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here.

- que:
  - Serious, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Forget it.
  ans:
  - Is that why you did it?

- que:
  - No, they don't, do they?
  ans:
  - Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.

- que:
  - What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
  ans:
  - What's left of my blood.

- que:
  - Nice joint. Can you afford it?
  ans:
  - Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.

- que:
  - So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
  ans:
  - Beats me.

- que:
  - You're coming.
  ans:
  - Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - Take a walk, pal.

- que:
  - Who said I was a lady?
  ans:
  - Oh my God, I look awful.

- que:
  - That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
  ans:
  - Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.

- que:
  - Where are we, mean man?
  ans:
  - Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...

- que:
  - Whattaya think you're in now?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You can't drink.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.

- que:
  - Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again, Will you marry me?
  ans:
  - Well... I'll act like I do until I do.

- que:
  - Will you marry me?
  ans:
  - It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.

- que:
  - You give up on her?
  ans:
  - ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - Oh Harry...

- que:
  - Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
  ans:
  - Sure I did, that's why I'm here.

- que:
  - How did I look?
  ans:
  - Oh, you... ...ennh.

- que:
  - I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...

- que:
  - It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
  ans:
  - That would be okay.

- que:
  - Where you goin'?
  ans:
  - Wherever they're going, I'm going.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
  ans:
  - Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...

- que:
  - What'd you do?
  ans:
  - No, I couldn't get my hands on one.

- que:
  - Did you expect him to look you up?
  ans:
  - Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...

- que:
  - Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
  ans:
  - Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.

- que:
  - Who're you?
  ans:
  - I live here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.

- que:
  - I already have.
  ans:
  - And what's the title of this seduc... assault?

- que:
  - How's it sound?
  ans:
  - The speech? Real good.

- que:
  - You think I got it?
  ans:
  - You got it.

- que:
  - Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
  ans:
  - It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.

- que:
  - Why are these all opened?
  ans:
  - Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.

- que:
  - Then why did you bring them?
  ans:
  - It's your fan mail, little sister.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Go on...

- que:
  - Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
  ans:
  - Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.

- que:
  - How long will you be?
  ans:
  - Not long.

- que:
  - At one. Promise?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
  ans:
  - Mama...?

- que:
  - I will, I promise.
  ans:
  - Where are you going?

- que:
  - Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
  ans:
  - I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.

- que:
  - Don't I know you?
  ans:
  - WIFE I don't believe so.

- que:
  - Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
  ans:
  - Thanks are hardly necessary.

- que:
  - Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
  ans:
  - Please sit down...

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - Normal. Average.

- que:
  - ...Did you really say that?
  ans:
  - Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.

- que:
  - Is there something else?
  ans:
  - You didn't say 'Symington says'.

- que:
  - ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
  ans:
  - Yes. It was very good to see her.

- que:
  - Really? Any problems?
  ans:
  - You're telling me you feel guilty.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
  ans:
  - Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?

- que:
  - But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
  ans:
  - Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.

- que:
  - Sedate her.
  ans:
  - Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?

- que:
  - I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
  ans:
  - And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.

- que:
  - And he drove me to mine.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Then why weep for him?
  ans:
  - Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.

- que:
  - What kindness?
  ans:
  - Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.

- que:
  - The music? Or the fire?
  ans:
  - I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.

- que:
  - Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
  ans:
  - Friends? Do they live around here?

- que:
  - How did you find me?
  ans:
  - The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.

- que:
  - Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
  ans:
  - Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.

- que:
  - Evil? Do you believe in evil?
  ans:
  - I see it before me.

- que:
  - Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
  ans:
  - There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.

- que:
  - What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
  ans:
  - Materials. Nothing more.

- que:
  - You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
  ans:
  - Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.

- que:
  - What can I do?
  ans:
  - There is something I want. A friend.

- que:
  - Friend?
  ans:
  - A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.

- que:
  - Soon?
  ans:
  - Yes. I want this over and done with.

- que:
  - Why... her?
  ans:
  - Her body pleases me.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me.

- que:
  - Is he not back yet?
  ans:
  - Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.

- que:
  - Are you sure it can't hurt us?
  ans:
  - Nothing can. Not ever.

- que:
  - How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
  ans:
  - It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.

- que:
  - What kind of God is He to will this?
  ans:
  - God took her from us.

- que:
  - Quite a send-off, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Father's so proud.

- que:
  - And you?
  ans:
  - Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.

- que:
  - You will. What do you want, Victor?
  ans:
  - I've loved you all my life

- que:
  - Brother and sister still?
  ans:
  - I wish to be your husband.

- que:
  - They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
  ans:
  - But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?

- que:
  - Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
  ans:
  - It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.

- que:
  - We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
  ans:
  - Why the change? What about your work?

- que:
  - Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
  ans:
  - Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.

- que:
  - This ice will break yet. How's our guest?
  ans:
  - He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.

- que:
  - You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
  ans:
  - I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.

- que:
  - Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
  ans:
  - No. But someday.

- que:
  - Professor?
  ans:
  - Oh God.

- que:
  - Are you having me on?
  ans:
  - Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.

- que:
  - Do you really think I'm mad?
  ans:
  - Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.

- que:
  - Can you think of a better reason?
  ans:
  - Quite a few.

- que:
  - How much longer?
  ans:
  - Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.

- que:
  - This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
  ans:
  - Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.

- que:
  - Yes? And?
  ans:
  - Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.

- que:
  - A... week?
  ans:
  - We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.

- que:
  - You've been going round-the-clock?
  ans:
  - We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.

- que:
  - Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
  ans:
  - Quite a place.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - This. My home. My family. If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.

- que:
  - What happened up there?
  ans:
  - I didn't find what I was looking for.

- que:
  - Are you sure you'll be all right?
  ans:
  - Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.

- que:
  - Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
  ans:
  - Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.

- que:
  - Philosophical?
  ans:
  - Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.

- que:
  - Paracelsus?
  ans:
  - Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...

- que:
  - What is your name?
  ans:
  - Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.

- que:
  - Of Geneva. Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
  ans:
  - You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.

- que:
  - You disdain accepted wisdom?
  ans:
  - No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.

- que:
  - Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
  ans:
  - Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

- que:
  - How is it you come to be here?
  ans:
  - Ah. An explorer.

- que:
  - You know of it?
  ans:
  - Your men are right to be afraid.

- que:
  - You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
  ans:
  - Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - My name is Frankenstein...

- que:
  - Jack? Marcie? Ned?
  ans:
  - It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.

- que:
  - So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
  ans:
  - Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...

- que:
  - What'd you see?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.

- que:
  - Any particular reason?
  ans:
  - Just a feeling. Nothing personal.

- que:
  - You want to leave?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.

- que:
  - Alice? The others show up?
  ans:
  - Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.

- que:
  - You think you're gonna last all summer?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure I'll last all week. I'll tell Steve.

- que:
  - Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
  ans:
  - Un-hunh.

- que:
  - How come you're leaving?
  ans:
  - It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.

- que:
  - Maybe I can help?
  ans:
  - And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.

- que:
  - What'll you do when you leave here?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
  ans:
  - Almost five.

- que:
  - How the... did he get in there?
  ans:
  - Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.

- que:
  - Trouble?
  ans:
  - Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.

- que:
  - Help you clean up?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - They're off now.

- que:
  - It's dead. Try the pay phone.
  ans:
  - Jack?

- que:
  - Do you have a dime? A quarter?
  ans:
  - No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.

- que:
  - What's the matter with it?
  ans:
  - Wet. I don't know.

- que:
  - Why don't we run? Just run now?
  ans:
  - It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.

- que:
  - Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Give me a hand?
  ans:
  - For sure.

- que:
  - Get behind him more.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - Chance to get even?
  ans:
  - I'll spot you five points.

- que:
  - Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
  ans:
  - I don't believe you...

- que:
  - What do you want to be when you grow up?
  ans:
  - Dancer.

- que:
  - No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
  ans:
  - Whatever you make yourself.

- que:
  - What hath God wrought?
  ans:
  - That was the telephone.

- que:
  - Jack?
  ans:
  - Coach, athletic director somewhere.

- que:
  - How about our last jay?
  ans:
  - Good call.

- que:
  - What about Neddy?
  ans:
  - I don't love Neddy.

- que:
  - You? The brick?
  ans:
  - It's just a dream.

- que:
  - Are you wet?
  ans:
  - Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.

- que:
  - Mmmmmmmph?
  ans:
  - Mmmmmmmph.

- que:
  - Whassamatta?
  ans:
  - Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.

- que:
  - Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
  ans:
  - Rocky Road.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Those things can be nasty.

- que:
  - Anything else you want?
  ans:
  - No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.

- que:
  - How much do I owe you?
  ans:
  - One night on the town.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You've made a science out of coincidence.

- que:
  - How many with you?
  ans:
  - Just my son and I.

- que:
  - What is your purpose in Mexico?
  ans:
  - Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.

- que:
  - Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
  ans:
  - I don't know, one place's as good as another.

- que:
  - Have you ever been there before?
  ans:
  - Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.

- que:
  - I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
  ans:
  - Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.

- que:
  - Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
  ans:
  - You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.

- que:
  - You like the car?
  ans:
  - I said new, this is an '90.

- que:
  - So do I just follow you?
  ans:
  - The truth hurts.

- que:
  - Why do you want to stop?
  ans:
  - I'm exhausted.

- que:
  - What's this guy's problem?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna try and get us across the border.

- que:
  - Have you forgotten about your sister?
  ans:
  - They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.

- que:
  - What about Kate?
  ans:
  - They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Jacob.

- que:
  - What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
  ans:
  - He's my son.

- que:
  - What's this about, money?
  ans:
  - On the dresser.

- que:
  - Come again?
  ans:
  - If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.

- que:
  - Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is. What are their names?
  ans:
  - Scott and Kate.

- que:
  - Who's this?
  ans:
  - My wife.

- que:
  - Where is the little lady?
  ans:
  - In heaven.

- que:
  - She's dead?
  ans:
  - Yes, she is.

- que:
  - How'd she die?
  ans:
  - Auto wreck.

- que:
  - Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
  ans:
  - No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.

- que:
  - Died instantly?
  ans:
  - Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.

- que:
  - Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
  ans:
  - Yes, they do.

- que:
  - Is this real?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You're a preacher?
  ans:
  - I was a minister.

- que:
  - Was? As in not anymore?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How do I know you'll keep your word?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.

- que:
  - Didn't like it, did ya?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't.

- que:
  - You won't let him touch her?
  ans:
  - I can handle Richie, don't worry.

- que:
  - As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
  ans:
  - I don't have the slightest idea.

- que:
  - Then?
  ans:
  - Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.

- que:
  - Who else?
  ans:
  - Pass.

- que:
  - Why not, against your religion?
  ans:
  - No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.

- que:
  - Why are you so agitated?
  ans:
  - I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.

- que:
  - What did you call me?
  ans:
  - To your family.

- que:
  - Now, is your shit together?
  ans:
  - Forever together.

- que:
  - You too, preacher?
  ans:
  - I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

- que:
  - Did he...?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - What's this stuff?
  ans:
  - Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.

- que:
  - Kate, Scott?
  ans:
  - It's the bitterest of pills.

- que:
  - I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
  ans:
  - I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.

- que:
  - What do you think Mom would say?
  ans:
  - Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

- que:
  - You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
  ans:
  - No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.

- que:
  - Scott?
  ans:
  - We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.

- que:
  - Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Where are you taking us?
  ans:
  - Mexico.

- que:
  - What's in Mexico?
  ans:
  - Mexicans.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - What you said to me in the room.

- que:
  - Creepy guy.
  ans:
  - What did I say?

- que:
  - You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you believe me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we got a bible.

- que:
  - How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm really sorry.

- que:
  - How many bullets left, kid?
  ans:
  - Not many.

- que:
  - Should I use the last bullets on us?
  ans:
  - You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.

- que:
  - Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
  ans:
  - We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.

- que:
  - Not even for lunch?
  ans:
  - I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.

- que:
  - Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
  ans:
  - You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.

- que:
  - That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
  ans:
  - Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.

- que:
  - What dya mean?
  ans:
  - This is a private club. You're not welcome.

- que:
  - I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
  ans:
  - Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?

- que:
  - What the fuck was that about?
  ans:
  - He signaled the Ranger.

- que:
  - You believe me don't cha?
  ans:
  - Shut up and start the car.

- que:
  - He didn't recognize shit.
  ans:
  - Richie? You okay?

- que:
  - Do they have cable?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do they have an X-rated channel?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do they have a waterbed?
  ans:
  - They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.

- que:
  - How's it feel?
  ans:
  - How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.

- que:
  - I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
  ans:
  - Feels good.

- que:
  - Did you even to try to negotiate?
  ans:
  - All I'm saying --

- que:
  - Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
  ans:
  - Sight seein'.

- que:
  - What'd ya see?
  ans:
  - Cops.

- que:
  - Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
  ans:
  - They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.

- que:
  - What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
  ans:
  - There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - This isn't gonna work.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You just called me a fuckin' nut.

- que:
  - I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
  ans:
  - This ain't the time.

- que:
  - Yeah, I think so. What happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know, you just passed out.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.

- que:
  - Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.

- que:
  - Far out. Where are my glasses?
  ans:
  - They broke when you fell.

- que:
  - That's what you think?
  ans:
  - That's how you're lookin', Richie.

- que:
  - I'm lookin' scared?
  ans:
  - That's what you look like.

- que:
  - No, Richie, what do I look like?
  ans:
  - You're lookin' green.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - I'm here with you.

- que:
  - Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Scarred for life, that's how I am!
  ans:
  - Okay, I'll have one.

- que:
  - Who's \"we\"?
  ans:
  - Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did. Not for me.

- que:
  - Who signed as his \"sponsoring officer\"?
  ans:
  - Uh... don't see it. There's no signature. But hang on -- there's a note to \"See Addendum.\" Checking...

- que:
  - Your prerogative, Senator.
  ans:
  - What'd you find, Kathy?

- que:
  - Awright. How's our girl doin', anyway?
  ans:
  - Standing right here in my office.

- que:
  - Jordan, dear. How are they treating you?
  ans:
  - Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.

- que:
  - Thank you, sir.
  ans:
  - \"Security\"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure?

- que:
  - Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
  ans:
  - None at this time, sir.

- que:
  - All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning. A name?
  ans:
  - It's you, sir. And it started the day I came here.

- que:
  - Pardon?
  ans:
  - I think you've resented me from the start, sir.

- que:
  - No, sir, WHAT?
  ans:
  - The shape doesn't bother me. It's just that goddamn rotten stench.

- que:
  - Well. 'Least now we're talking the same language. So one standard. Is that what you're after?
  ans:
  - Same rules for everyone, sir.

- que:
  - Straight up?
  ans:
  - Across the board, sir.

- que:
  - So I'll get a fair shot?
  ans:
  - You'll get everything you want, O'Neil. Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.

- que:
  - Permission to leave, sir?
  ans:
  - Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.

- que:
  - Sir? What did he say?
  ans:
  - Entering my scan now...

- que:
  - West?
  ans:
  - Shit. Think we're had.

- que:
  - O'Neil. Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there. You know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - White House boys want a private meeting.

- que:
  - Think I overplayed it?
  ans:
  - Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing. They'll never know whose leak it is.

- que:
  - Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether --
  ans:
  - I was one member of the investigating commission.

- que:
  - So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
  ans:
  - Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's. And your conclusion was \"pilot error,\" hmm?

- que:
  - Thank you, ma'am. Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
  ans:
  - \"Coronado.\"

- que:
  - I know that, sir. Ma'am. It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
  ans:
  - Captain Dwyer. Technically.

- que:
  - Would I be the only one? The only woman?
  ans:
  - Absolutely not.

- que:
  - What changed?
  ans:
  - Should probably ask him that.

- que:
  - So? Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
  ans:
  - You don't know that.

- que:
  - What are you saying? That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
  ans:
  - You were never going to let women serve in combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did.

- que:
  - You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
  ans:
  - I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began. And that's quite verifiable.

- que:
  - You'll think about my offer?
  ans:
  - You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it. If I spoke with him.

- que:
  - So she picks the women, we pick the programs. Seals?
  ans:
  - 1 I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.

- que:
  - What the hell is the President trying to do? Steal DeHaven's thunder?
  ans:
  - 1 I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.

- que:
  - Montgomery, why do they call you \"Flea\"?
  ans:
  - It's really \"F. Lee Montgomery\" -- but that gets whittled down to just \"Flea.\" For short, ma'am.

- que:
  - So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
  ans:
  - No, ma'am.

- que:
  - Hey. You okay, Flea?
  ans:
  - Snot me. It's him.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.

- que:
  - She's a trainee, just like the others. Why are you coming down so hard?
  ans:
  - She's an officer. There's a higher standard.

- que:
  - The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday. By 18-hundred he was gone. Out of the Navy.
  ans:
  - What \"all females\"? If I'm the only --

- que:
  - Just a coincidence?
  ans:
  - Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts. But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.

- que:
  - Do we know it's him using the beacon? Not a decoy?
  ans:
  - Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.

- que:
  - Chances of recovery?
  ans:
  - You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil. Analyze.

- que:
  - Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir. Why not?
  ans:
  - That was good headwork, lieutenant.

- que:
  - Thank you, sir. We hear back from the Pentagon?
  ans:
  - Probably hear back from CNN first.

- que:
  - So why're you even considering it? Are you?
  ans:
  - Just like you would be.

- que:
  - Wai', wait. What happens if it works? Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
  ans:
  - I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan. Maybe we should just let it happen.

- que:
  - I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
  ans:
  - It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce. Much less keep up with my phone life.

- que:
  - Don't you know? How they're talking about you?
  ans:
  - I saw an article...

- que:
  - So why are you telling me this?
  ans:
  - That's not what I want, Jordan. I mean... it is and it isn't...

- que:
  - Almost like someone put him up to it. Okay, who?
  ans:
  - No shortage of suspects.

- que:
  - The Chief? Or maybe even Turrentine? Your C.O.?
  ans:
  - C'mon, Jordan. Do the headwork with me.

- que:
  - Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
  ans:
  - Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.

- que:
  - Instructors typically pull three year assignments. This guy's in and out in one year -- your year. That sound right?
  ans:
  - Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...

- que:
  - Whose orders were those?
  ans:
  - It was made clear. Anyway, stay ballsy. First week's hell, then it levels out. Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway. That's hell-and-a-half.

- que:
  - And how do you know that?
  ans:
  - Made it to Week 10 last time.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - You know, I had an apartment about this size once.

- que:
  - Wick. They got your crew, too?
  ans:
  - Intagliata was out chasing breakfast. They found his tracks. Well, shit.

- que:
  - You really came back for more? Of this?
  ans:
  - If you got a good one, Wick...

- que:
  - They had to kill 'em?
  ans:
  - That's a good story.

- que:
  - He was married?
  ans:
  - At first.

- que:
  - How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
  ans:
  - Last time I didn't.

- que:
  - Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four. Don't wanna come, do you?
  ans:
  - I can't go out. Not like this.

- que:
  - She part of the training?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area. Now how smart is that?
  ans:
  - Maybe half. Not even.

- que:
  - Say again, sir?
  ans:
  - You heard me. Move on.

- que:
  - Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross. May I ask what you got it for?
  ans:
  - For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.

- que:
  - Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
  ans:
  - Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion. Men fight better without women around. And that is an historical fact.

- que:
  - Any brothers? Sisters?
  ans:
  - Dick, Jane, and Spot.

- que:
  - Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
  ans:
  - Wasn't deemed a threat.

- que:
  - That's not right.
  ans:
  - She led us right to you. That's no threat?

- que:
  - That's what your crew said. Are they lying? Or are you?
  ans:
  - I think you're the liar.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured? Didn't you even think about that?
  ans:
  - Sure. Just like your men do.

- que:
  - Say again? How many micks?
  ans:
  - 15, sir.

- que:
  - Well, who the shit you think you are? Comin' in here like that?
  ans:
  - Your new roommate.

- que:
  - Anybody usin' these drawers here?
  ans:
  - Hey, hey, HEY. No possibility. You can't stay in here. You can't sleep right next to me.

- que:
  - WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
  ans:
  - Clear.

- que:
  - North?
  ans:
  - Sure. Now she wants to shoot.

- que:
  - FLEA! KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it! Cortez? What the hell you waiting for?
  ans:
  - Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.

- que:
  - Can't live with them, can't kill them. What's the point?
  ans:
  - O'Neil, Jordan.

- que:
  - You knew about us?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Thought you knew I knew.

- que:
  - All right. So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
  ans:
  - Congress cuts, military bleeds. But Pentagon's a big place. Let's narrow the sights.

- que:
  - Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first. But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
  ans:
  - Possibly. Just to spite DeHaven.

- que:
  - The first female President?
  ans:
  - Women.

- que:
  - If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Seems...

- que:
  - Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day. Know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Okay, so now work it from the other end. Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.

- que:
  - I don't... What, someone on base? A \"mole\"?
  ans:
  - That's cuz I'm married to you.

- que:
  - Shut up. How can you eat like that?
  ans:
  - Big bites.

- que:
  - Who the hell are all these people?
  ans:
  - What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.

- que:
  - Where's Audrey?
  ans:
  - In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - All that \"you gotta be vicious\" stuff you filled her head with.

- que:
  - Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
  ans:
  - Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.

- que:
  - How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
  ans:
  - Nearly four years...

- que:
  - Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
  ans:
  - Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.

- que:
  - Yeah. Why are you asking?
  ans:
  - I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.

- que:
  - Don't you think we have enough?
  ans:
  - Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

- que:
  - Think we can fit up in there?
  ans:
  - Only one way to find out.

- que:
  - The JFK? In the rain!?
  ans:
  - What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.

- que:
  - Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
  ans:
  - It's good to see you, Nick.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

- que:
  - So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
  ans:
  - No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real \"boring\" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...

- que:
  - You're still mad at me, aren't you?
  ans:
  - You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.

- que:
  - Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
  ans:
  - Sure. I'd like that.

- que:
  - And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
  ans:
  - I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.

- que:
  - And you think this creature is one of them?
  ans:
  - Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...

- que:
  - Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
  ans:
  - I got pretty close.

- que:
  - What else do you know about it?
  ans:
  - ...he's pregnant.

- que:
  - Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
  ans:
  - You never said it was off the record.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.

- que:
  - Did Romeo have a name?
  ans:
  - Nick Tatopoulos.

- que:
  - Your old sweetheart?
  ans:
  - I left my forgery kit back at the office.

- que:
  - What do I get?
  ans:
  - The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.

- que:
  - Did you talk with Humphries?
  ans:
  - This is not the place...

- que:
  - Just tell me, did you talk with him?
  ans:
  - He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.

- que:
  - Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
  ans:
  - Mr. Caiman, you're married.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...

- que:
  - Not now. You got my bag?
  ans:
  - You don't understand, I can get us information...

- que:
  - Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
  ans:
  - Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

- que:
  - Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm not married.

- que:
  - Really? A girlfriend then?
  ans:
  - No. Perhaps I work too much.

- que:
  - You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
  ans:
  - Not for a long time, now.

- que:
  - Oh, thank you. Is she always like this?
  ans:
  - Hence the radiation.

- que:
  - Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Where's Luc and Pierre?
  ans:
  - They didn't make it.

- que:
  - Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
  ans:
  - Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.

- que:
  - Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
  ans:
  - And how should we do that, Sir?

- que:
  - Major, what do you think could have done this?
  ans:
  - Get your people out of there or I will.

- que:
  - Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
  ans:
  - It's Tatopoulos.

- que:
  - Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
  ans:
  - Follow me.

- que:
  - Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you're the worm guy.

- que:
  - The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
  ans:
  - No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.

- que:
  - What sample?
  ans:
  - You're standing on it.

- que:
  - But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
  ans:
  - We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.

- que:
  - What are you suggesting?
  ans:
  - When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.

- que:
  - You gave them the tape?
  ans:
  - No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.

- que:
  - That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
  ans:
  - Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.

- que:
  - Are you looking for this?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - We've met before.

- que:
  - Are you sure? How do you know?
  ans:
  - We know.

- que:
  - Why are you telling this to me?
  ans:
  - I need you to trust me.

- que:
  - Why do you need that?
  ans:
  - I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.

- que:
  - How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
  ans:
  - This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.

- que:
  - So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
  ans:
  - I am not permitted to speak of such things.

- que:
  - I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - So you're in?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.

- que:
  - What's with the chewing gum?
  ans:
  - Makes us look more American.

- que:
  - How do I do that?
  ans:
  - 555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.

- que:
  - What'd they say?
  ans:
  - I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.

- que:
  - Who the hell are you?
  ans:
  - It's okay. I know her.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's Raymond.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - I understand.

- que:
  - This is it?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.

- que:
  - Is that the bathroom?
  ans:
  - Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

- que:
  - What's the scale? Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - ~hex! Alex, are you oKav?
  ans:
  - Not again...

- que:
  - What's happened?
  ans:
  - The engines are dead. We're drifting.

- que:
  - You were holding it upside down weren't you?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
  ans:
  - You have a better plan, Alex?

- que:
  - Dear God.... How did I come to this?
  ans:
  - Alex you can't -just leave.

- que:
  - Why didn't you stop at the market?
  ans:
  - I still haven't got this bloody thing off.

- que:
  - May I get the check?
  ans:
  - The ships are gaining...

- que:
  - Alex? Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To see if there's a pub.

- que:
  - Could they be the miners?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Those blue things ate everybody here?
  ans:
  - It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...

- que:
  - He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
  ans:
  - Down there.

- que:
  - Oh. Okay.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
  ans:
  - I have sectors 1-28. I think Hector has the upper levels.

- que:
  - ... Yes?
  ans:
  - We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.

- que:
  - What's your name, son?
  ans:
  - Brandon.

- que:
  - Yes...?
  ans:
  - Okay, that's where you want to be.

- que:
  - How did you come to that conclusion?
  ans:
  - My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman. He's seen it 13 times...

- que:
  - What? Up?
  ans:
  - Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.

- que:
  - I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
  ans:
  - Raise the glass and push the blue button.

- que:
  - That's It?
  ans:
  - Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.

- que:
  - What's the weather like outside?
  ans:
  - There is no weather in space.

- que:
  - Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
  ans:
  - I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.

- que:
  - The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - As good as Hopkins?
  ans:
  - Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.

- que:
  - How do you remember this stuff?
  ans:
  - Oh I make it up. Use lots of \"k\"s and \"v\"s.

- que:
  - You Okay, Alex?
  ans:
  - I don't like this... I don't like this at all...

- que:
  - Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
  ans:
  - Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.

- que:
  - THAT'S why you built this ship?
  ans:
  - It's ... incredible.

- que:
  - Where are the miners?
  ans:
  - Something BAD happened here.

- que:
  - We should have a turbo. I'm always saying \"activate turbo boosters\", right?...
  ans:
  - How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?

- que:
  - Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
  ans:
  - Your last name.

- que:
  - Yeah, what is it?
  ans:
  - It's... I don't know.

- que:
  - Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
  ans:
  - It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.

- que:
  - We~re oetting hammered, Jason. Return fIre?
  ans:
  - No. Keep all energy to the armor.

- que:
  - Hey, YOU want to drive?
  ans:
  - \"Assault on Voltareck III.\" Episode... 31 I think.

- que:
  - We're doing episode 31?
  ans:
  - Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.

- que:
  - Not a clue. You?
  ans:
  - I think he just likes pointing at things.

- que:
  - How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
  ans:
  - What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You smiled at me.

- que:
  - Wait. When are you going to tell them?
  ans:
  - Tell them? About...

- que:
  - Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.

- que:
  - Hey... Hey where are you going?
  ans:
  - We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.

- que:
  - We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
  ans:
  - JASON...

- que:
  - I thought It was the \"We're dead\" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is?
  ans:
  - Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...

- que:
  - Are they behind us?
  ans:
  - No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but... Something is. Oh my god.

- que:
  - Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
  ans:
  - Self control? That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...

- que:
  - Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
  ans:
  - I could have held on to YOU! ...

- que:
  - How does the rolling help, actually?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...

- que:
  - What? What did he say?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Hold please.

- que:
  - Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
  ans:
  - Turn on the translation circuit.

- que:
  - So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - This is great! They're going to start eating each other out there.
  ans:
  - We shouldn't have to DO this! It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?

- que:
  - You're kidding. When for?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.

- que:
  - I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
  ans:
  - Sure, no problem.

- que:
  - JASON You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
  ans:
  - Closer? I can try.

- que:
  - Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
  ans:
  - Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.

- que:
  - Commander... Welcome to the Protector II. Would you like to don your uniform?
  ans:
  - Mind If we skip that? I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.

- que:
  - Commander?... Where are you... going?
  ans:
  - Home.

- que:
  - You... You mean Earth?
  ans:
  - Yeah. \"Earth.\" Time to get back to \"Earth,\" kids.

- que:
  - Right. Long live... What's your planet?
  ans:
  - Theramin.

- que:
  - But what if Sarris survives?
  ans:
  - NO, Thank God he has not.

- que:
  - Then how did he find out about the device?
  ans:
  - Our former Commander was not... Strong.

- que:
  - Former Commander?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.

- que:
  - Mathesar? What is that?
  ans:
  - It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.

- que:
  - You what?.. What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...

- que:
  - But...Why?
  ans:
  - It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.

- que:
  - That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
  ans:
  - You can oc that?

- que:
  - Wh... Where are we?
  ans:
  - Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector. I can show you on a map.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - I think we're going to exit the space port.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...

- que:
  - All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
  ans:
  - Why don't you just turn it on and see?

- que:
  - What kind of signal?
  ans:
  - Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.

- que:
  - Jason? What about me? What do I do?
  ans:
  - Practice driving, Tommy.

- que:
  - Commander?... Call me Laredo?
  ans:
  - Mark 20 Into the black hole, areao.

- que:
  - Continue forward, sir?
  ans:
  - Patience, Lt. . Patience.

- que:
  - Well, now there's something worth dying for. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.

- que:
  - And a French alliance?
  ans:
  - Arnold!

- que:
  - Well, George, who were you?
  ans:
  - I? You all know my history.

- que:
  - While they're strung out?
  ans:
  - Same old story.

- que:
  - Cut those men down. Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial. Benedict, trust me to handle this.
  ans:
  - Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?

- que:
  - Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
  ans:
  - Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.

- que:
  - You are never, never to touch my guns! Do you understand!?
  ans:
  - Yes, General. But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.

- que:
  - Misunderstood what!?
  ans:
  - A lot of years have gone by.

- que:
  - What? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - That you would have known you can trust me.

- que:
  - Me? You apologizing to me?
  ans:
  - Yes, William. I am apologizing.

- que:
  - Yes, general?
  ans:
  - Yes, general.

- que:
  - Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
  ans:
  - No. I guess.

- que:
  - No uniforms. No coats, even? In this weather?
  ans:
  - No, my lord.

- que:
  - And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
  ans:
  - Many of them, many did not possess proper arms. My lord.

- que:
  - Negroes? Washington has black men in his army? Are they good fighters? What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
  ans:
  - Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons. My lord.

- que:
  - By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
  ans:
  - I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...

- que:
  - Who is that!?
  ans:
  - I'll be twenty next year, sir.

- que:
  - Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
  ans:
  - Therefore, retreat.

- que:
  - And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
  ans:
  - Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness. It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.

- que:
  - With pleasure... and an honor. Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
  ans:
  - That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.

- que:
  - Are you going to keep him, sir?
  ans:
  - We better, Congress invented him.

- que:
  - What are we going to do?
  ans:
  - Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.

- que:
  - This is a declaration of insurrection! Who wrote this!?
  ans:
  - No one knows...

- que:
  - George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
  ans:
  - To hell with Arnold...

- que:
  - I want to address the officers, all the officers. Next Friday. Can we arrange it at the mess?
  ans:
  - Yes, I believe so.

- que:
  - Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king? Not a dictator over subjects?
  ans:
  - Horatio! Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.

- que:
  - Who's in command out there?
  ans:
  - Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic.

- que:
  - You invented this, this...
  ans:
  - Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?

- que:
  - Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
  ans:
  - Partially...

- que:
  - Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
  ans:
  - These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.

- que:
  - I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
  ans:
  - General Lee is detained captain...

- que:
  - Unofficially, General Greene.
  ans:
  - Detained by what?

- que:
  - Any word from Canada?
  ans:
  - Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...

- que:
  - A fleet?
  ans:
  - My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold? He's up there.

- que:
  - A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
  ans:
  - No. As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.

- que:
  - And, Hamilton? Greene?
  ans:
  - They help me understand why we fight.

- que:
  - What I want to know is sir, where is your daddy?
  ans:
  - Uh... none just now, but...

- que:
  - These supplies...?
  ans:
  - Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.

- que:
  - When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
  ans:
  - And how rusty are these muskets?

- que:
  - What is it, Marquis?
  ans:
  - My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...

- que:
  - My God, what?
  ans:
  - The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear, a classless world. Not a very real expectation.

- que:
  - And, what 'prize' do you see? What could we possible gain?
  ans:
  - But, as usual, it will not go well for... them. Martha, you must trust me.

- que:
  - When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
  ans:
  - That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...

- que:
  - Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
  ans:
  - Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.

- que:
  - Martha... what?
  ans:
  - To win this war I need an army.

- que:
  - What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
  ans:
  - Some things must never change.

- que:
  - I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
  ans:
  - We can't take them. Are you all right?

- que:
  - It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene. Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
  ans:
  - I was born with a limp, sir. The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...

- que:
  - But, you do come from a military family?
  ans:
  - I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now. My father is an ironmaster. As was I.

- que:
  - A horseshoer?
  ans:
  - Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me. Maybe I will let you down yet.

- que:
  - General Greene?
  ans:
  - I'm with Captain Hamilton.

- que:
  - You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
  ans:
  - I will not betray you, Nathanael.

- que:
  - Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
  ans:
  - What the hell are we doing?

- que:
  - I'd throw everything away for you.
  ans:
  - That's a lie!

- que:
  - You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
  ans:
  - I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.

- que:
  - Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
  ans:
  - Really? Which precious homily was it?

- que:
  - Where... do those men come from, George?
  ans:
  - Africa, of course.

- que:
  - Africa? That's so far? How do they get here?
  ans:
  - Slavers capture them and bring them here.

- que:
  - What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
  ans:
  - It's stupid, of course.

- que:
  - Then why are you teaching me...?
  ans:
  - Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it. You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.

- que:
  - Those people? I doubt they'd think of this. Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
  ans:
  - What are you doing?

- que:
  - That's good... who?
  ans:
  - Voltaire, of course...

- que:
  - You hear that?
  ans:
  - That? I hear a mob, unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.

- que:
  - Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
  ans:
  - Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - An Oldsmobile Silhouette.

- que:
  - You're kidding me, right?
  ans:
  - Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.

- que:
  - You see that? The way the man just went right over?
  ans:
  - Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.

- que:
  - So where's the money?
  ans:
  - I guess still in the locker.

- que:
  - You guess? You mean you don't know?
  ans:
  - I mean I don't care.

- que:
  - You see the paper?
  ans:
  - I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.

- que:
  - Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
  ans:
  - Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.

- que:
  - And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
  ans:
  - Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.

- que:
  - No. What's this?
  ans:
  - Plan B. Here ya go, honey...

- que:
  - Trade for what?
  ans:
  - The money. Fuck. I gotta think...

- que:
  - Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
  ans:
  - Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.

- que:
  - What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
  ans:
  - I have to ask you for that key.

- que:
  - What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
  ans:
  - Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.

- que:
  - How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
  ans:
  - I think I pulled my quadriceps.

- que:
  - So... how many movies you been in?
  ans:
  - About sixty.

- que:
  - Yayo. Where is he?
  ans:
  - Sure. Family. I know how that goes.

- que:
  - You gave him the money?
  ans:
  - I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.

- que:
  - Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
  ans:
  - Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.

- que:
  - Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
  ans:
  - He's around someplace.

- que:
  - What's this movie you're doing first?
  ans:
  - Harry, let me answer that.

- que:
  - But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
  ans:
  - You can talk to me.

- que:
  - No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
  ans:
  - I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.

- que:
  - I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.

- que:
  - What about her?
  ans:
  - Get something going there.

- que:
  - With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
  ans:
  - She's... young.

- que:
  - Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.

- que:
  - That's all there is to it, huh?
  ans:
  - That's all.

- que:
  - What money?
  ans:
  - The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.

- que:
  - Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
  ans:
  - I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.

- que:
  - What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
  ans:
  - In just a second. Two...

- que:
  - Karen? You okay?
  ans:
  - She can't talk right now.

- que:
  - You know Laurel Canyon?
  ans:
  - I'll find it.

- que:
  - In the can. That the money?
  ans:
  - She's great. Gimme the money.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.

- que:
  - You positive about that?
  ans:
  - I'm working on a few things.

- que:
  - Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.

- que:
  - Chili Palmer showed you my script?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.

- que:
  - You serious?
  ans:
  - All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.

- que:
  - You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
  ans:
  - We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.

- que:
  - He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
  ans:
  - Leo, I don't know.

- que:
  - Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
  ans:
  - The airport.

- que:
  - I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
  ans:
  - What I been wondering is where's he been.

- que:
  - What three hundred grand?
  ans:
  - The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.

- que:
  - Hello? You there?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.

- que:
  - So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
  ans:
  - Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.

- que:
  - Or else what?
  ans:
  - Or else use your fucking imagination.

- que:
  - Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
  ans:
  - Ray. Look at me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Look at me, Ray.

- que:
  - You say look at you?
  ans:
  - That's correct. Look at me.

- que:
  - How'd you get in here?
  ans:
  - I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.

- que:
  - So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
  ans:
  - Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.

- que:
  - Why would I do that?
  ans:
  - Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.

- que:
  - Yeah? Which terminal?
  ans:
  - Sovereign.

- que:
  - You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go. Why haven't you left?
  ans:
  - I like it here.

- que:
  - Who the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - Ray Barboni. From Miami.

- que:
  - What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
  ans:
  - The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.

- que:
  - You live in Miami?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What're you doing in Los Angeles?
  ans:
  - I'm in the movie business.

- que:
  - You're an investor, is that it?
  ans:
  - I'm a producer.

- que:
  - You have a card in here?
  ans:
  - Not yet. I just started.

- que:
  - Your wife a Lakers fan?
  ans:
  - I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.

- que:
  - It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
  ans:
  - Something shouldn't be there.

- que:
  - Leo spanked a waitress?
  ans:
  - Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.

- que:
  - What've you got?
  ans:
  - Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.

- que:
  - Where you been, Harry?
  ans:
  - Have we met? I don't recall.

- que:
  - Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
  ans:
  - You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.

- que:
  - I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
  ans:
  - That's what I'm doing.

- que:
  - Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
  ans:
  - Harry, lemme give you some advice.

- que:
  - Why do I have to keep looking at you?
  ans:
  - I want you to.

- que:
  - You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
  ans:
  - Fuckin' basketball game.

- que:
  - You make movies, huh?
  ans:
  - Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.

- que:
  - Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
  ans:
  - You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.

- que:
  - That's it? That's your movie?
  ans:
  - I said I had an idea, that's all.

- que:
  - You mean, Leo?
  ans:
  - You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.

- que:
  - But you work for the casino?
  ans:
  - I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.

- que:
  - Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
  ans:
  - What I did till recently. After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.

- que:
  - You pack a gun?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Maybe a few times I have.

- que:
  - Really? You ever been arrested?
  ans:
  - I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.

- que:
  - Harry, look at me.
  ans:
  - Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?

- que:
  - You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
  ans:
  - Because I need half a million to buy a script.

- que:
  - For a movie?
  ans:
  - A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my \"Driving Miss Daisy\".

- que:
  - What's it called?
  ans:
  - \"Mr. Lovejoy\".

- que:
  - \"Mr. Lovejoy\"? That's the title?
  ans:
  - It's not bad when you know what it's about.

- que:
  - Who's the star?
  ans:
  - Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.

- que:
  - He drown?
  ans:
  - Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.

- que:
  - What do you get out of this?
  ans:
  - Let's see how we get along.

- que:
  - How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
  ans:
  - Hey, Harry.

- que:
  - Is he giving you a check or cash?
  ans:
  - Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.

- que:
  - A meeting with who? You and Karen?
  ans:
  - I found him.

- que:
  - You have it?
  ans:
  - Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.

- que:
  - You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
  ans:
  - Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.

- que:
  - How'd you know he died, he tell you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he told me.

- que:
  - Personally?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.

- que:
  - What Get Away jet?
  ans:
  - It was in the Herald.

- que:
  - We talk different?
  ans:
  - You mean like we don't give a shit.

- que:
  - One of mine?
  ans:
  - One we're producing.

- que:
  - With what? Wiseguy money?
  ans:
  - Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.

- que:
  - What happened? The pressure got to you?
  ans:
  - Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.

- que:
  - Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
  ans:
  - Martin, look at me.

- que:
  - Wait. How about this?
  ans:
  - Now you're squinting like you need glasses.

- que:
  - How about this?
  ans:
  - That's not bad.

- que:
  - How do I know that?
  ans:
  - The wife sues the airline. This is a gutsy babe.

- que:
  - So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
  ans:
  - Okay. I'm listening.

- que:
  - You're not going to tell me the rest?
  ans:
  - Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.

- que:
  - Buddy?
  ans:
  - Very nice...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Compass.

- que:
  - Whatta you think, Chill?
  ans:
  - That's not bad. I think you got it down.

- que:
  - You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
  ans:
  - They report it to the IRS.

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.

- que:
  - How'd you know I was here?
  ans:
  - Here's another tip...

- que:
  - It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.

- que:
  - How? By taking my money?
  ans:
  - You can keep what you won today. That's yours.

- que:
  - You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
  ans:
  - At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.

- que:
  - It's not one of these?
  ans:
  - You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.

- que:
  - Maybe you don't see my sign?
  ans:
  - We call you a taxi.

- que:
  - You broke in?
  ans:
  - No, it was open. It wasn't locked.

- que:
  - What if it was?
  ans:
  - Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.

- que:
  - The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
  ans:
  - That's right. Three percent.

- que:
  - What're you doing here?
  ans:
  - I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.

- que:
  - Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
  ans:
  - No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.

- que:
  - Like in \"Bride of the Mutant\", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
  ans:
  - Rough day on the set?

- que:
  - You saw that one?
  ans:
  - I married Martin. That was a full- time job.

- que:
  - That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
  ans:
  - Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.

- que:
  - You been here the whole time?
  ans:
  - I just caught the end.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think it's not horrible.

- que:
  - Then you've read it?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - There a part in it for you?
  ans:
  - I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.

- que:
  - That why you came over here, to ask me that?
  ans:
  - I want to know.

- que:
  - Why does anyone want to be in movies?
  ans:
  - Yesterday, you were a loan shark.

- que:
  - And you think the movie business is any different?
  ans:
  - This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...

- que:
  - Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.

- que:
  - You don't like Martin much, do you?
  ans:
  - Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.

- que:
  - So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
  ans:
  - How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah. There's a girl in it now.

- que:
  - You thought I was faking?
  ans:
  - No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.

- que:
  - You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
  ans:
  - Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

- que:
  - What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
  ans:
  - Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.

- que:
  - Are you going down?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.

- que:
  - Were you scared up there?
  ans:
  - You bet.

- que:
  - I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
  ans:
  - I'll be right back.

- que:
  - What took you so long?
  ans:
  - Couldn't find my toothbrush.

- que:
  - They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
  ans:
  - Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.

- que:
  - You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
  ans:
  - That's what the guy said.

- que:
  - That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
  ans:
  - In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.

- que:
  - How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
  ans:
  - He already knew it.

- que:
  - Whatta you doing out there?
  ans:
  - I'm going into the movie business.

- que:
  - What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
  ans:
  - I'm thinking about producing.

- que:
  - Yeah, but whose point of view?
  ans:
  - Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.

- que:
  - Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now... She's gonna talk to Martin?
  ans:
  - All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.

- que:
  - Yeah? What three words, Harry?
  ans:
  - Pick 'n' Save.

- que:
  - Hm?
  ans:
  - You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.

- que:
  - Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
  ans:
  - Come on in.

- que:
  - Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there. What do you want, Doris?
  ans:
  - I miss Murray, Harry.

- que:
  - Yeah, what'd he have to say?
  ans:
  - He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Be quiet and listen.

- que:
  - Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
  ans:
  - Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.

- que:
  - How did you get in the house?
  ans:
  - He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far. Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.

- que:
  - With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.

- que:
  - Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
  ans:
  - He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.

- que:
  - Shylock?
  ans:
  - Karen. Wow. Look at you...

- que:
  - Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
  ans:
  - It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.

- que:
  - But you are interested?
  ans:
  - Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.

- que:
  - Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
  ans:
  - A passenger liner. Over.

- que:
  - Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
  ans:
  - They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.

- que:
  - You think the extra strain caused it?
  ans:
  - Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.

- que:
  - How about now?
  ans:
  - Sixty pounds.

- que:
  - What? You sure?
  ans:
  - That's what it says.

- que:
  - Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
  ans:
  - Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?

- que:
  - What's so great about Sweden?
  ans:
  - It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.

- que:
  - I don't know. Tuesday?
  ans:
  - Wrong. It's Friday.

- que:
  - Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
  ans:
  - You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.

- que:
  - Where from?
  ans:
  - Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.

- que:
  - One more?
  ans:
  - Why not.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Maureen.

- que:
  - Maureen?
  ans:
  - Roger.

- que:
  - Roger?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
  ans:
  - Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.

- que:
  - Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy. Any questions?
  ans:
  - Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Bring it on, dude.

- que:
  - Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
  ans:
  - I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.

- que:
  - What're you crazy?
  ans:
  - I like my job.

- que:
  - So we kill him?
  ans:
  - I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.

- que:
  - Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
  ans:
  - Seen a lota movies.

- que:
  - Smokes?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.

- que:
  - Then what the hell happened to him?
  ans:
  - Try Wednesday.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Dodge. Dodge.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Get up.

- que:
  - You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
  ans:
  - Threw a turbine blade.

- que:
  - How long to fix?
  ans:
  - Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Turbine rotor's shot.

- que:
  - The right way and the wrong way.
  ans:
  - How much longer's that gonna take?

- que:
  - But how long?
  ans:
  - Hard to say.

- que:
  - What about running number two by itself?
  ans:
  - It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.

- que:
  - How long, then?
  ans:
  - I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - Three, four days.

- que:
  - She take a radio?
  ans:
  - It's a hell of a lot of money.

- que:
  - A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
  ans:
  - Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.

- que:
  - So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
  ans:
  - A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.

- que:
  - You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
  ans:
  - So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.

- que:
  - How about you Epps?
  ans:
  - Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.

- que:
  - What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
  ans:
  - We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.

- que:
  - Can't you use something else?
  ans:
  - I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I think you better see this for yourself.

- que:
  - It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
  ans:
  - Not me.

- que:
  - On a passenger ship in 1953?
  ans:
  - If they knew what they were carrying.

- que:
  - How do you mean?
  ans:
  - Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.

- que:
  - What do you propose?
  ans:
  - You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.

- que:
  - I didn't touch the fucking radio! Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
  ans:
  - Conveniently enough for you.

- que:
  - Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's slow?
  ans:
  - Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

- que:
  - Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
  ans:
  - Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.

- que:
  - That's a good thing?
  ans:
  - Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.

- que:
  - What'd he look like?
  ans:
  - Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.

- que:
  - Any dizziness?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Lights?
  ans:
  - Sudden flashes of light.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Let's get outa here.

- que:
  - Candy?
  ans:
  - It's my pen name.

- que:
  - Coffee?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Thanks.

- que:
  - What'd you find up there?
  ans:
  - Some charts. A crew manifest. Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.

- que:
  - She was sailing up north, right?
  ans:
  - Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

- que:
  - Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - So what did happen?
  ans:
  - Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.

- que:
  - You think she's sailing without a crew?
  ans:
  - I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.

- que:
  - Why not call for help?
  ans:
  - For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The guy. He just came this way.

- que:
  - What guy?
  ans:
  - There's somebody else on this boat.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

- que:
  - You sure it wasn't me?
  ans:
  - It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.

- que:
  - No cowboy shit up there, understand?
  ans:
  - No cowboy shit. Right.

- que:
  - Got your light?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - You just shoot at something?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.

- que:
  - Greer?
  ans:
  - I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.

- que:
  - Same. Any luck?
  ans:
  - No. I'll try again later.

- que:
  - You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
  ans:
  - If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Somebody took it out of commission last night.

- que:
  - Collision? With what?
  ans:
  - The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.

- que:
  - But where's the damage?
  ans:
  - Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.

- que:
  - I don't know, are we?
  ans:
  - When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something. Someone.

- que:
  - What, like some kind of ghost?
  ans:
  - I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.

- que:
  - Showing you what?
  ans:
  - What happened.

- que:
  - Victims of what?
  ans:
  - Something bad happened here, Murphy.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
  ans:
  - Just lucky I guess.

- que:
  - Either of you seen Dodge?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Epps? You there?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - What do we do with him?
  ans:
  - Leave him till we can get some help. From now on, nobody comes down here.

- que:
  - It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
  ans:
  - What do you think?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - We hit land.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.

- que:
  - And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
  ans:
  - I didn't want it to turn out this way.

- que:
  - Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
  ans:
  - I think I see it pretty well.

- que:
  - What do you say, Dodge?
  ans:
  - Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.

- que:
  - Call the Coastguard?
  ans:
  - Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.

- que:
  - Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
  ans:
  - Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.

- que:
  - So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
  ans:
  - We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - We could call for help.

- que:
  - Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece. What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
  ans:
  - Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.

- que:
  - Greer?
  ans:
  - Moving to Sweden.

- que:
  - Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
  ans:
  - I say we off-load some of that gold now.

- que:
  - How're you feeling?
  ans:
  - Lost my sea legs.

- que:
  - You don't remember?
  ans:
  - Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.

- que:
  - Say what?
  ans:
  - Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.

- que:
  - We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
  ans:
  - I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.

- que:
  - Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
  ans:
  - It's a Noaa buoy.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.

- que:
  - What about the gold?
  ans:
  - Leave it.

- que:
  - You think whoever did this is reasonable?
  ans:
  - All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.

- que:
  - What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
  ans:
  - Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.

- que:
  - Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
  ans:
  - I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.

- que:
  - Or what?
  ans:
  - I thought you say Tuesday.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - You got a leak in the number nine compartment.

- que:
  - You're kidding, right?
  ans:
  - You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.

- que:
  - Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
  ans:
  - Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.

- que:
  - Will you get off my back for once?
  ans:
  - It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Guess.

- que:
  - How should I know?
  ans:
  - Someone from the past.

- que:
  - Give up?
  ans:
  - YES.

- que:
  - Not the Maxine?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
  ans:
  - I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.

- que:
  - Are you still looking for a job?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Pumpkin? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I heard about that.

- que:
  - What do you mean \"on his way up\"!?
  ans:
  - I just buzzed him in.

- que:
  - Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
  ans:
  - Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!

- que:
  - Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
  ans:
  - Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...

- que:
  - What are you trying to say?
  ans:
  - It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.

- que:
  - Who is this, Enid?
  ans:
  - It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

- que:
  - And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
  ans:
  - I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.

- que:
  - And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
  ans:
  - It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...

- que:
  - Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
  ans:
  - Uh-oh.

- que:
  - Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
  ans:
  - I'm not really sure - working, I guess...

- que:
  - I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
  ans:
  - Well, yes...

- que:
  - Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
  ans:
  - I didn't check my messages...

- que:
  - Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
  ans:
  - But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.

- que:
  - What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of \"frozen yogurt\"?
  ans:
  - Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.

- que:
  - Aren't there a million places like this?
  ans:
  - This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.

- que:
  - So, where's \"Weird Al\"?
  ans:
  - SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.

- que:
  - Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you the one who left that note?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
  ans:
  - Yeah, right...

- que:
  - \"Yeah, right\"... well why not? What's so wrong with me?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - When did I say I hated you?
  ans:
  - You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.

- que:
  - Why do you have that stupid poster?
  ans:
  - Oh, hi...

- que:
  - How long have you been up?
  ans:
  - I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...

- que:
  - Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
  ans:
  - I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.

- que:
  - Hey Josh.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - Are you ready to go?
  ans:
  - You loser.

- que:
  - What? Why?
  ans:
  - Forget it...

- que:
  - Since when is she an \"actress\"?
  ans:
  - I know, she needs to die immediately.

- que:
  - Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
  ans:
  - How perfect.

- que:
  - So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
  ans:
  - Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.

- que:
  - Did you sign up yet?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.

- que:
  - What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
  ans:
  - You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...

- que:
  - \"Authentic 50's diner\"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
  ans:
  - God, it's so totally pathetic.

- que:
  - Can we call you \"Weird Al\"?
  ans:
  - Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.

- que:
  - Does Oomie really like this show?
  ans:
  - Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.

- que:
  - So what should we do?
  ans:
  - Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.

- que:
  - Hey - why do you have this?
  ans:
  - You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

- que:
  - I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
  ans:
  - I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?

- que:
  - Which loser?
  ans:
  - You know, the green cardigan guy.

- que:
  - Why do I always have to do it?
  ans:
  - I dunno...

- que:
  - He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
  ans:
  - Are you sure?

- que:
  - I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
  ans:
  - Come on, it's too late now...

- que:
  - What about the \"striking redhead in the yellow dress\"?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.

- que:
  - I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
  ans:
  - What? How long have you been standing there?

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Let's go hassle Josh.

- que:
  - \"Hassle\"?
  ans:
  - There he is...

- que:
  - Should we leave a note?
  ans:
  - Why are we going here? I hate this place.

- que:
  - How about this one?
  ans:
  - Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.

- que:
  - Ew ... when did you get that?
  ans:
  - This morning at Seymour's garage sale.

- que:
  - How about this?
  ans:
  - Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.

- que:
  - If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
  ans:
  - Just now... I went with Seymour.

- que:
  - God, how can you stand all these assholes?
  ans:
  - I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.

- que:
  - Yeah, well... So when are you going to get your job?
  ans:
  - I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.

- que:
  - Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
  ans:
  - You're gross. See that guy?

- que:
  - Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
  ans:
  - ...maybe we should be lesbos...

- que:
  - When are you finally going to get your diploma?
  ans:
  - I dunno, but next week is my last class...

- que:
  - Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
  ans:
  - Wasn't it like eighth grade?

- que:
  - Now are you going to get a regular job?
  ans:
  - Don't worry.

- que:
  - Do you want to do something tonight?
  ans:
  - I can't, it's Seymour's birthday... Shit! What time is it? I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...

- que:
  - Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I guess... call me...

- que:
  - Don't you want nice stuff?
  ans:
  - I can't imagine spending money on towels.

- que:
  - What thing?
  ans:
  - That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.

- que:
  - So should I come over?
  ans:
  - Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...

- que:
  - What are you talking about? Who?
  ans:
  - Just some people from work...

- que:
  - Why? What did he say?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - When was this?
  ans:
  - I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.

- que:
  - What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
  ans:
  - I need to talk to you.

- que:
  - So, whaddya think?
  ans:
  - It's fine.

- que:
  - So where's all your stuff?
  ans:
  - There.

- que:
  - That's all you're bringing?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - I dunno...

- que:
  - Do you want anything?
  ans:
  - Maybe an orange juice.

- que:
  - We're not.
  ans:
  - What about me? Am I not even here?

- que:
  - Really? Both of you?... Why not?
  ans:
  - Just because.

- que:
  - What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
  ans:
  - Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.

- que:
  - So what are you guys doing this Summer?
  ans:
  - My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.

- que:
  - Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
  ans:
  - May I ask what you're doing?

- que:
  - How much is this?
  ans:
  - Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.

- que:
  - Do you have any other old records besides these?
  ans:
  - Seymour does.

- que:
  - Who does?
  ans:
  - Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.

- que:
  - You still interested in that?
  ans:
  - I thought it wasn't for sale.

- que:
  - Hi... what's your name?
  ans:
  - Norman.

- que:
  - ...are you waiting for a bus?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Did you bring that tape?
  ans:
  - You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.

- que:
  - Hey, where are you going?
  ans:
  - Later, \"Dude\".

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Five hundred.

- que:
  - Well why do I care about that?
  ans:
  - Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...

- que:
  - There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
  ans:
  - Sure, I guess.

- que:
  - You're right about that. So this is your record collection?
  ans:
  - Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.

- que:
  - Really? Can I see it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...

- que:
  - Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...

- que:
  - But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
  ans:
  - I really didn't get a good look at her.

- que:
  - C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
  ans:
  - I'm just not one of those guys who has a \"type\"...

- que:
  - Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests. I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
  ans:
  - Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.

- que:
  - So is that your boyfriend?
  ans:
  - Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.

- que:
  - Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us... Please?
  ans:
  - These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.

- que:
  - C'mon, Seymour, please?
  ans:
  - Relax, Seymour, relax...

- que:
  - I'm not holding my breath in that department.
  ans:
  - So, why did you bring this along?

- que:
  - What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
  ans:
  - Jesus, Seymour.

- que:
  - Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
  ans:
  - Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...

- que:
  - What did you tell that girl?
  ans:
  - I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.

- que:
  - If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
  ans:
  - I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...

- que:
  - What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
  ans:
  - What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.

- que:
  - \"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS\"!
  ans:
  - What, are you a klansman or something?

- que:
  - You work at Cook's Chicken?
  ans:
  - For nineteen years...

- que:
  - What are you, a fry cook or something?
  ans:
  - Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.

- que:
  - What? Why?
  ans:
  - You can open your eyes now.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...

- que:
  - What, like a girdle?
  ans:
  - Never...

- que:
  - Never mind, it's way too complicated... Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
  ans:
  - I won't even dignify that with a response.

- que:
  - Aren't you going to get that?
  ans:
  - Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...

- que:
  - Wow! What was that all about?
  ans:
  - It's just somebody's idea of a joke...

- que:
  - That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
  ans:
  - Hi, it's me...

- que:
  - So, what happened?
  ans:
  - Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...

- que:
  - Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
  ans:
  - What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?

- que:
  - No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
  ans:
  - I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...

- que:
  - Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
  ans:
  - Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...

- que:
  - So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
  ans:
  - Sounds good...

- que:
  - ...so... is he your boyfriend now?
  ans:
  - It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...

- que:
  - What's her problem anyway? Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
  ans:
  - No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...

- que:
  - What does she mean by that - \"somebody like me\"?
  ans:
  - Just someone so young...

- que:
  - Does that mean you don't like me?
  ans:
  - No, of course not.

- que:
  - In what way do you mean?
  ans:
  - In whatever way you think I mean.

- que:
  - ...What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I had to see you.

- que:
  - Can you at least let me in?
  ans:
  - Uh... sure... come in.

- que:
  - Do you have anything to drink?
  ans:
  - Uh... I think there's some root beer...

- que:
  - I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
  ans:
  - What about this?

- que:
  - I hate sports.
  ans:
  - Where did you get this?

- que:
  - How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.

- que:
  - I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure. Of course.

- que:
  - What about Joe?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well I like you too...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I dunno, I...

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...

- que:
  - You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
  ans:
  - They're Seymour's.

- que:
  - Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
  ans:
  - Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records? She could at least have the decency to call me back.

- que:
  - Please Josh?
  ans:
  - Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.

- que:
  - I wish I could see him.
  ans:
  - So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?

- que:
  - Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What do we have here, Margaret?
  ans:
  - It's a tampon in a teacup...

- que:
  - I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
  ans:
  - It's a \"found object\"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.

- que:
  - Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
  ans:
  - No... they said she was here...

- que:
  - Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why? What did she tell you?
  ans:
  - She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...

- que:
  - What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

- que:
  - Did she say that?
  ans:
  - Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - On that pathetic fake blind date.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...

- que:
  - What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.

- que:
  - So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
  ans:
  - Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.

- que:
  - Why don't we start with that next week?
  ans:
  - Thank you, doctor.

- que:
  - Let me see the sick.
  ans:
  - Seymour?

- que:
  - Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
  ans:
  - There is no reason for fear.

- que:
  - Am I to take it you want to live?
  ans:
  - Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

- que:
  - -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.

- que:
  - Pleasant journey?
  ans:
  - How could it be? I hate Africa.

- que:
  - So work must be going well?
  ans:
  - Truthfully? There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.

- que:
  - But overall, you're pleased?
  ans:
  - I do need to see Starling.

- que:
  - Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here?
  ans:
  - It hasn't been that simple so far.

- que:
  - Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
  ans:
  - I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.

- que:
  - And it worked?
  ans:
  - In point of fact, it didn't. But I'm convinced the theory is sound.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.

- que:
  - Then why do you stay?
  ans:
  - Who else would hire me? Beat you to it, didn't I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.

- que:
  - I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about it?
  ans:
  - Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey. With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.

- que:
  - Then why do it?
  ans:
  - You never had it.

- que:
  - A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
  ans:
  - -then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-

- que:
  - Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
  ans:
  - I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.

- que:
  - Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
  ans:
  - It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.

- que:
  - Anything special about them?
  ans:
  - Just that they fart through their mouths. Must make kissing something of a gamble.

- que:
  - I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
  ans:
  - Almost three hours. But I've been getting ready all my life.

- que:
  - Have you got that in writing?
  ans:
  - Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.

- que:
  - Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
  ans:
  - I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.

- que:
  - And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
  ans:
  - Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.

- que:
  - You said \"of course\" you'd need the donkey. Why \"of course\"?
  ans:
  - I don't suppose I could watch.

- que:
  - I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
  ans:
  - Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.

- que:
  - But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. Samuel?
  ans:
  - What a good week.

- que:
  - You mean nobody died?
  ans:
  - I didn't have a chance to thank you.

- que:
  - What did I do?
  ans:
  - Got me out of trouble.

- que:
  - Have you got it?
  ans:
  - No, but you do- -see, you were needed after all. And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.

- que:
  - Has it ever done that before?
  ans:
  - ...don't know...

- que:
  - Have you ever failed?
  ans:
  - Only in life...

- que:
  - What happened to them?
  ans:
  - I got big.

- que:
  - Their den? Have you ever seen anything like this?
  ans:
  - Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this- -they're doing it for pleasure.

- que:
  - Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water? They're only lions, yes?
  ans:
  - Don't they have to be?...

- que:
  - Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your fear?
  ans:
  - I'll have to.

- que:
  - Was that supposed to make me feel better?
  ans:
  - It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.

- que:
  - You think they'll come then? Why?
  ans:
  - Good luck.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I think they're after you.

- que:
  - The most of any lions... a hundred...? Probably more. Johnny...?
  ans:
  - I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.

- que:
  - Why do the workers look unhappy?
  ans:
  - Because they are here. Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. Come, John- to the bridge.

- que:
  - I am also liaison between these two.
  ans:
  - Did it look like this in your mind?

- que:
  - What are they looking at?
  ans:
  - You- they cannot believe you're still here.

- que:
  - Good news?
  ans:
  - I expect so- it's from my wife.

- que:
  - Do you love her?
  ans:
  - I do, actually; very much.

- que:
  - You like him, don't you?
  ans:
  - Oh yes. But it takes time.

- que:
  - You've known him long?
  ans:
  - Since his beard was red.

- que:
  - Thank you. Why does he need you by him?
  ans:
  - He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times... ...he knows I am afraid of lions...

- que:
  - He has children?
  ans:
  - Once...

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - I don't believe you had a mother.

- que:
  - How many cattle?
  ans:
  - Four should do it.

- que:
  - Why so many?
  ans:
  - Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.

- que:
  - Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
  ans:
  - Help finish the railroad.

- que:
  - We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
  ans:
  - Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.

- que:
  - Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do. Do I have bad breath or something?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.

- que:
  - Do you need anything? You want me to come in?
  ans:
  - No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway.

- que:
  - Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.

- que:
  - What do you want with my baby?
  ans:
  - If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.

- que:
  - What are you working on, Egon?
  ans:
  - We'll do the happiness index next. I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.

- que:
  - How is he these days?
  ans:
  - Venkman? I think he was borderline for a while there. Then he crossed the border.

- que:
  - Does he ever mention me?
  ans:
  - No. Not that I can recall.

- que:
  - This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
  ans:
  - Certainly.

- que:
  - Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
  ans:
  - I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a building superintendent.

- que:
  - Hiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger?
  ans:
  - That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.

- que:
  - Didn't I do it?
  ans:
  - No, you didn't, Frank.

- que:
  - You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show?
  ans:
  - I have. That's why I didn't call you first.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - His name is Oscar.

- que:
  - You are personally responsible. If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
  ans:
  - Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.

- que:
  - You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
  ans:
  - I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.

- que:
  - So this is what you do, huh?
  ans:
  - Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

- que:
  - Who could blame him? Were you wearing this nightgown?
  ans:
  - I don't know what to do anymore.

- que:
  - Peter, what about the bathtub?
  ans:
  - We'll take care of that. Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.

- que:
  - Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
  ans:
  - Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a babysitter and everything. Trust me, you need it.

- que:
  - Does she know anything about babies?
  ans:
  - Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.

- que:
  - Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
  ans:
  - I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty.

- que:
  - So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
  ans:
  - I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.

- que:
  - All right, you want to be real? So tell me why did you dump me?
  ans:
  - Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had to protect myself. You really weren't very good for me, you know.

- que:
  - So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
  ans:
  - Let me jingle you right now.

- que:
  - Finally came to your senses, huh?
  ans:
  - That's not true. It was 1620.

- que:
  - Is this the spot?
  ans:
  - A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped.

- que:
  - Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
  ans:
  - It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I can't be sure, Peter.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

- que:
  - I'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
  ans:
  - I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just want to say hello to him.

- que:
  - Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
  ans:
  - Now you're talking.

- que:
  - What is it, honey?
  ans:
  - It's that darn ghost again! I don't know what to do anymore. He just won't leave us alone. I guess we'll just have to move.

- que:
  - Who are you going to call?
  ans:
  - Ghostbusters.

- que:
  - What are you doing up here?
  ans:
  - I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.

- que:
  - Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.

- que:
  - I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit. Do you want to babysit with me?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure, that sounds great.

- que:
  - You're really good with children, Louis. I can tell. Why don't you come here and sit with me?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Should we go?
  ans:
  - I don't think we should leave her alone.

- que:
  - I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do they know you're doing this?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.

- que:
  - How are you? What's that you're working on, Johnny?
  ans:
  - We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.

- que:
  - Then why have you come?
  ans:
  - We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list. Your name was first.

- que:
  - You know, I never got to ask you. Where you from, Johnny?
  ans:
  - The Upper West Side.

- que:
  - So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
  ans:
  - Not. Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.

- que:
  - Your honor, may I approach the bench?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Get on with it, counselor!
  ans:
  - Can I have some of your water?

- que:
  - Did I forget something?
  ans:
  - Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this for me. I'm begging you.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

- que:
  - I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year. Forget it, Louis. I could get in a lot of trouble.

- que:
  - Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
  ans:
  - I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

- que:
  - Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did. We were city champs.

- que:
  - So what are you saying? That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
  ans:
  - No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.

- que:
  - How've you been? How's teaching? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
  ans:
  - I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.

- que:
  - Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
  ans:
  - This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.

- que:
  - Pretty impressive, huh?
  ans:
  - It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.

- que:
  - From where -- Neptune?
  ans:
  - They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

- que:
  - Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come up with anything?
  ans:
  - You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.

- que:
  - Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
  ans:
  - The New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an experimental subway system. Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.

- que:
  - We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
  ans:
  - What's the reading?

- que:
  - You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
  ans:
  - There's definitely something going on in that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.

- que:
  - Is the line sinking?
  ans:
  - No, the slime is rising.

- que:
  - Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
  ans:
  - Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.

- que:
  - Great. So what are you guys working on?
  ans:
  - It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.

- que:
  - Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy?
  ans:
  - I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

- que:
  - You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
  ans:
  - If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.

- que:
  - And now you're going to eat it?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

- que:
  - This is what you do with your spare time?
  ans:
  - This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.

- que:
  - I'll get one more reading.
  ans:
  - What kind of tests?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.

- que:
  - Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
  ans:
  - Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

- que:
  - Good effort. Now what? Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
  ans:
  - I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.

- que:
  - Only one way to find out. Ready, Teddy?
  ans:
  - I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.

- que:
  - I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - I'm ready.

- que:
  - Does it have any favorites?
  ans:
  - It likes all the sappy stuff, 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

- que:
  - You finished here?
  ans:
  - What? Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you all right? You coming down with something?
  ans:
  - No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go.

- que:
  - Nice going, Ray! What were you trying to do -- drown me?
  ans:
  - Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.

- que:
  - Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
  ans:
  - Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.

- que:
  - And decent.
  ans:
  - You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?

- que:
  - Wonder what?
  ans:
  - If she's naked under that toga. She's French, you know.

- que:
  - Aren't you glad we waited?
  ans:
  - It is a star! That's great. You're very good.

- que:
  - Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
  ans:
  - No. They're just coming to me.

- que:
  - Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
  ans:
  - Definitely. I think you may be a very gifted telepath.

- que:
  - ... I thought it was the drug store.
  ans:
  - Eight o'clock?

- que:
  - Are you sick, Louis?
  ans:
  - No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning.

- que:
  - Are you the Gatekeeper?
  ans:
  - I am Zuul.

- que:
  - Hello. I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?
  ans:
  - Yes ... well ... I'm not sure. What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.

- que:
  - Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
  ans:
  - Some people like the attention. Some people are just crazy.

- que:
  - Is that your professional opinion?
  ans:
  - It's in the stars.

- que:
  - Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
  ans:
  - No. If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real. I'm not ready to do that.

- que:
  - Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
  ans:
  - I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.

- que:
  - No? What do I act like?
  ans:
  - Like a used car salesman.

- que:
  - Thanks. What's in there?
  ans:
  - That's too bad.

- que:
  - Nothing. Is that the kitchen?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - All right. What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - I think I should spend the night here.

- que:
  - No kiss?
  ans:
  - Great rehearsal.

- que:
  - You heard it?
  ans:
  - You're the best one in your row.

- que:
  - Who's the stiff?
  ans:
  - The \"stiff?\" He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.

- que:
  - He is a very close friend. Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
  ans:
  - Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.

- que:
  - Can't you tell me now?
  ans:
  - You must have gotten the last copy.

- que:
  - I've got to go now.
  ans:
  - Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?

- que:
  - Hey, Dana. What is it? What happened?
  ans:
  - I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper.

- que:
  - Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something?
  ans:
  - He is the Destructor.

- que:
  - Do you want this body?
  ans:
  - Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.

- que:
  - Really! Is it gone?
  ans:
  - Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.

- que:
  - Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian. Are you the men from the University?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.

- que:
  - Did you see it? What was it?
  ans:
  - We'll get back to you.

- que:
  - It's a great game! You should play sometime. I bet you'd be good. You seem very athletic. Do you have any hobbies?
  ans:
  - I collect spores, molds and fungus.

- que:
  - Die in what sense?
  ans:
  - In the physical sense.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow. It's my lucky coin.

- que:
  - What calls?
  ans:
  - Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card.

- que:
  - The EPA? What's he want?
  ans:
  - I didn't ask him. All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.

- que:
  - Did you ever report it to anyone?
  ans:
  - Heavens, no! The owners don't like us to even talk about it. I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.

- que:
  - Are you Peter Venkman?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.

- que:
  - Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
  ans:
  - I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.

- que:
  - I see. And now you catch ghosts?
  ans:
  - You could say that.

- que:
  - And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
  ans:
  - I'm not at liberty to say.

- que:
  - And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
  ans:
  - In a storage facility.

- que:
  - And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
  ans:
  - Yes, it would.

- que:
  - And may I see this storage facility?
  ans:
  - No, you may not.

- que:
  - And why not, Mr. Venkman?
  ans:
  - Because you didn't say the magic word.

- que:
  - Why do you want to see it?
  ans:
  - Go ahead! Get a court order. Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.

- que:
  - A square?
  ans:
  - Good guess -- but no.

- que:
  - Circle?
  ans:
  - Close -- but definitely wrong.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - Yes. I don't like this.

- que:
  - Two wavy lines?
  ans:
  - Sorry. This isn't your day.

- que:
  - Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks. What are you trying to prove?
  ans:
  - I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.

- que:
  - Hey, Mister! Can I see those guns?
  ans:
  - They're not guns. They're particle throwers.

- que:
  - Wait! Wait! Let me ask you something. If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
  ans:
  - The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...

- que:
  - When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
  ans:
  - Oh! You're here.

- que:
  - What have you got, Egon?
  ans:
  - Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.

- que:
  - Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
  ans:
  - I'm always serious.

- que:
  - Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. What do you think, Egon?
  ans:
  - She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.

- que:
  - Did you see anything?
  ans:
  - Something was definitely here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Don't cross the beams.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Trust me. It will be bad.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.

- que:
  - Some. I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now. Venkman? Are you there?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Gozer.

- que:
  - You talked to Gozer?
  ans:
  - Get a grip on yourself, Egon. I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - Full-stream with strogon pulse.

- que:
  - I've got to sleep.
  ans:
  - Ray! Where are you? Are you all right?

- que:
  - I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
  ans:
  - I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there. And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.

- que:
  - What happened?!!!?
  ans:
  - The storage facility blew. This one ... ... shut off the protection grid.

- que:
  - You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
  ans:
  - That appears to be the case.

- que:
  - Excuse me for a minute. Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here. Can you come back in about an hour?
  ans:
  - Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
  ans:
  - What do you mean by \"seen?\"

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.

- que:
  - What do we do now?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Talk to it.

- que:
  - What do I say?
  ans:
  - Anything! Just make contact.

- que:
  - \"Get her?\" That was your whole plan? You call that science?
  ans:
  - If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.

- que:
  - For what purpose?
  ans:
  - To go into business for ourselves.

- que:
  - Do you think it's wide enough? How much?
  ans:
  - Fourteen hundred.

- que:
  - How was your date?
  ans:
  - It wasn't a date. It was an investigation.

- que:
  - Don't move. It won't hurt you.
  ans:
  - Where are you, Pete?

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm just guessing.

- que:
  - Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
  ans:
  - It's not good, Pete.

- que:
  - Who was the architect?
  ans:
  - He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.

- que:
  - Yeah, I heard that. Now tell me what you really do.
  ans:
  - Agile bastard, isn't he?

- que:
  - Hey man. What is it you're so involved with there?
  ans:
  - Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.

- que:
  - Are you a Christian, Ray?
  ans:
  - Mmmhmmm.

- que:
  - Do you believe in God?
  ans:
  - No. But I liked Jesus' style.

- que:
  - Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
  ans:
  - And the seas would boil ...

- que:
  - Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
  ans:
  - You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.

- que:
  - What's he talking about? Choose what?
  ans:
  - Maybe you should get married. Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.

- que:
  - I should at least have you, don't you think?
  ans:
  - If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.

- que:
  - Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?
  ans:
  - Kill him! Tribuus -- execute that bastard.

- que:
  - Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
  ans:
  - You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.

- que:
  - What is that... wailing?
  ans:
  - The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.

- que:
  - Lykas, pick a man. Someone who will look good. Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
  ans:
  - But I get what I want, always, don't I?

- que:
  - Do you want posters, too?
  ans:
  - Damn him! I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.

- que:
  - Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
  ans:
  - That's difficult to say, general.

- que:
  - Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political. Not a Republican by any chance?
  ans:
  - I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.

- que:
  - Caesar?
  ans:
  - That this illness has clouded his mind.

- que:
  - Where is my family?
  ans:
  - Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you.

- que:
  - On what charge?
  ans:
  - Insubordination. To the Emperor... and the Senate.

- que:
  - Gods of hell! This must cost a fortune! How many days is this going to go on?
  ans:
  - Until your confirmation date.

- que:
  - Give away food?
  ans:
  - Sacks of grain, even bread. I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.

- que:
  - Take grain away from the army?
  ans:
  - Make a gift to the people. It's your money anyway so it's only fair.

- que:
  - Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
  ans:
  - He must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.

- que:
  - Yes, Caesar?
  ans:
  - Jerses -- tomorrow...

- que:
  - The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates. He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
  ans:
  - Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?

- que:
  - God of passages and changes?
  ans:
  - I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory. Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.

- que:
  - But have never been?
  ans:
  - My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books. But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.

- que:
  - The Senate too?
  ans:
  - I hope you live to see what I believe...

- que:
  - How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
  ans:
  - When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.

- que:
  - I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
  ans:
  - You're a citizen and a soldier. Not a gladiator.

- que:
  - Why you?
  ans:
  - My loyalties... were in doubt.

- que:
  - Is this Rome? Are we just going to be executed?
  ans:
  - They can't... if this is Rome...

- que:
  - You know our two most senior Senators, Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
  ans:
  - Only from a distance.

- que:
  - Sneaking around with your brother?
  ans:
  - Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.

- que:
  - Why do you play at being drunk?
  ans:
  - It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.

- que:
  - Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them.
  ans:
  - Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children? The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.

- que:
  - Servis made it through again?
  ans:
  - He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.

- que:
  - Tomorrow?
  ans:
  - As soon as I can.

- que:
  - On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
  ans:
  - On my honor as your daddy...

- que:
  - What the hell was all that about?
  ans:
  - What the hell do you think it was about? There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.

- que:
  - What deal?
  ans:
  - Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.

- que:
  - Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
  ans:
  - He's very realistic.

- que:
  - Isn't the helmet magnificent?
  ans:
  - Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.

- que:
  - Greeks?
  ans:
  - Athenians...

- que:
  - What about their philosophy lessons?
  ans:
  - They're studying with Cynics.

- que:
  - This is our oil from our estates?
  ans:
  - I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.

- que:
  - I'm a soldier -- we're at war. I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
  ans:
  - We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.

- que:
  - You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...? and you act like one. What was your crime?
  ans:
  - I killed too many barbarians.

- que:
  - Condemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
  ans:
  - Death is a very light thing for you.

- que:
  - General, do you realize what happened out there today?
  ans:
  - I didn't get killed and everyone else did.

- que:
  - How much money is involved?
  ans:
  - A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot...

- que:
  - I can really rape them on this! Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
  ans:
  - No. Tell them I'll do it. But I want more posters all over Rome.

- que:
  - Right, right, what am I thinking of?
  ans:
  - I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.

- que:
  - Was I?
  ans:
  - I want nothing to do with the arena.

- que:
  - Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you?
  ans:
  - Commodus must hate you. Free your gladiators and come with us.

- que:
  - You're living at home now. Is that right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you know what you're going to do?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you going to graduate school?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you always drive like this?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you want some dinner?
  ans:
  - I'd love some.

- que:
  - Aren't you eating?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.

- que:
  - No -- why should I?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Could you do it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Will you take me home now?
  ans:
  - I just want to tell you something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.

- que:
  - Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
  ans:
  - No, I couldn't.

- que:
  - But could you try?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is anything wrong?
  ans:
  - No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.

- que:
  - Where we going?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.

- que:
  - What is the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.

- que:
  - Benjamin -- do they know you?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
  ans:
  - I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Was she married or something?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - With a family?
  ans:
  - Yes. She had a husband and a son.

- que:
  - Did they ever find out?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You sure you really want to?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Benjamin -- I really do.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.

- que:
  - Benjamin -- what's happening?
  ans:
  - Hurry up. Put your shoes on.

- que:
  - Why aren't you ready?
  ans:
  - Because I want to know what's happening.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That woman. The older woman.

- que:
  - Where are you meeting this person?
  ans:
  - At the Zoo.

- que:
  - The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
  ans:
  - I've never been to it.

- que:
  - Is that him over there?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where did he say he was going to meet you?
  ans:
  - I thought he said by the monkey house.

- que:
  - Here? In Berkeley?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.

- que:
  - No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
  ans:
  - Because -- I am.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - I think it is.

- que:
  - How could you do that, Benjamin?
  ans:
  - Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...

- que:
  - Did you say rape her?
  ans:
  - -- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.

- que:
  - What did she say?
  ans:
  - Let me go.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because it isn't true.

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.

- que:
  - Can I just sit here while you're packing?
  ans:
  - If you want.

- que:
  - What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - My belt.

- que:
  - Don't you have it on?
  ans:
  - No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.

- que:
  - The marble?
  ans:
  - The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.

- que:
  - What are you going to do now?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Are you going home?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well -- where are you going?
  ans:
  - I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

- que:
  - You won't?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Is that so? You might marry me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You mean you're confused?
  ans:
  - Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.

- que:
  - Elaine -- are you serious about this?
  ans:
  - I'll think about it.

- que:
  - You really will?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.

- que:
  - We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
  ans:
  - I just don't think it would work.

- que:
  - Why wouldn't it?
  ans:
  - I just don't think it would...

- que:
  - Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
  ans:
  - Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.

- que:
  - Carl who?
  ans:
  - Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.

- que:
  - Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why do you have to see him?
  ans:
  - Well -- I said I might marry him.

- que:
  - Are we getting married tomorrow?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The day after tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.

- que:
  - Hello -- who is this?
  ans:
  - This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

- que:
  - Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
  ans:
  - Oh. Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.

- que:
  - Are you listening?
  ans:
  - Yes I am.

- que:
  - There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
  ans:
  - Yes, I will.

- que:
  - You a student?
  ans:
  - Not exactly.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I said -- not exactly -- no.

- que:
  - What are you then?
  ans:
  - Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - One of those outside agitators.

- que:
  - Who screamed?
  ans:
  - It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

- que:
  - What did you do to her?
  ans:
  - Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.

- que:
  - All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Mr. McCleery?
  ans:
  - You heard me. Out of here.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Because I don't like you.

- que:
  - Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
  ans:
  - I want you out of here.

- que:
  - Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
  ans:
  - I am going to call the police now.

- que:
  - VOICE BENJAMIN?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - VOICE Will you bring up my purse before you go?
  ans:
  - I have to go now. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Mrs. Robinson?
  ans:
  - VOICE I'm in the bathroom.

- que:
  - VOICE Could you bring it up?
  ans:
  - Well I'll hand it to you.

- que:
  - VOICE For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
  ans:
  - I'm putting it here by the door.

- que:
  - VOICE Will you bring it in to me?
  ans:
  - Uh -- The Taft Hotel.

- que:
  - VOICE Give me an hour.
  ans:
  - VOICE Did you get a room?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.

- que:
  - Yes sir?
  ans:
  - A room. I'd like a room, please.

- que:
  - A single room or a double room?
  ans:
  - A single. Just for myself, please.

- que:
  - Is anything wrong, sir?
  ans:
  - What? No. Nothing.

- que:
  - Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?
  ans:
  - Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.

- que:
  - Where is your luggage?
  ans:
  - Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.

- que:
  - Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
  ans:
  - It's down the hall.

- que:
  - How are you, Benjamin?
  ans:
  - Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.

- que:
  - Is there an ashtray in here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is what a girl?
  ans:
  - Whatever it is you're upset about.

- que:
  - You don't?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I want you to come in till I get the lights on.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.

- que:
  - Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
  ans:
  - All right then.

- que:
  - What do you drink?
  ans:
  - Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Please wait till my husband gets home.

- que:
  - When is he coming back?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Drink?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
  ans:
  - I'm very neurotic.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.

- que:
  - No.
  ans:
  - Did you know I was an alcoholic?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My husband will be back quite late.

- que:
  - Pardon?
  ans:
  - Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Well I don't know.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.

- que:
  - Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
  ans:
  - It's all right.

- que:
  - Her portrait?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
  ans:
  - Very much.

- que:
  - Will you unzip my dress?
  ans:
  - I think I'll go to bed.

- que:
  - Won't you unzip my dress?
  ans:
  - I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

- que:
  - What are you so scared of?
  ans:
  - I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

- que:
  - Then why do you keep running away?
  ans:
  - Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.

- que:
  - Don't you think he trusts us together?
  ans:
  - Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.

- que:
  - Is that what you're trying to tell me?
  ans:
  - I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - On that chair in the hall.

- que:
  - Benjamin?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - May I sit down?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Very well. Thank you.

- que:
  - May I have a drink?
  ans:
  - I haven't. No.

- que:
  - Do you want to?
  ans:
  - Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.

- que:
  - Do you want me to get it?
  ans:
  - You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I think that would be good.

- que:
  - To tell you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.

- que:
  - I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
  ans:
  - Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.

- que:
  - Why don't you watch?
  ans:
  - Oh -- sure. Thank you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A hanger.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Wood or wire? They have both.

- que:
  - Would this be easier for you in the dark?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - This is all terribly wrong.

- que:
  - Are you afraid of me?
  ans:
  - No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.

- que:
  - Is this -- what?
  ans:
  - It is, isn't it? It is your first time.

- que:
  - Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
  ans:
  - If you want.

- que:
  - Good. I mean are we dead or something?
  ans:
  - Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.

- que:
  - Well what do you want to talk about?
  ans:
  - Anything. Anything at all.

- que:
  - Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
  ans:
  - Oh my God.

- que:
  - Oh.
  ans:
  - Well?

- que:
  - Don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.

- que:
  - You're not interested in art?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then why do you want to talk about it?
  ans:
  - I don't.

- que:
  - Can I take off my clothes now?
  ans:
  - No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.

- que:
  - Do you really want me to?
  ans:
  - Yes I do.

- que:
  - Do you want to hear it or not?
  ans:
  - Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.

- que:
  - Him?
  ans:
  - There isn't any.

- que:
  - How do you get out of the house?
  ans:
  - I walk out.

- que:
  - What do you say to him?
  ans:
  - He's asleep.

- que:
  - Always?
  ans:
  - Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.

- que:
  - Can I undress and talk at the same time?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Oh no. Are you kidding me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You have not slept with your husband for five years?
  ans:
  - Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.

- que:
  - No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
  ans:
  - Is it?

- que:
  - Well how do you feel about him, then?
  ans:
  - I don't.

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.

- que:
  - Well, wait a minute. You married him.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Why did you do that?
  ans:
  - See if you can guess.

- que:
  - I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
  ans:
  - Don't tell Elaine.

- que:
  - Are you shocked?
  ans:
  - Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...

- que:
  - I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
  ans:
  - Not particularly.

- que:
  - Was he a law student at the time?
  ans:
  - And you were a student also.

- que:
  - Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
  ans:
  - Art.

- que:
  - Art?
  ans:
  - But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.

- que:
  - Well how did it happen?
  ans:
  - How do you think.

- que:
  - Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
  ans:
  - I'm curious.

- que:
  - Oh no. In the car you did it?
  ans:
  - I don't think we were the first.

- que:
  - Do you remember the make of the car?
  ans:
  - Oh my God.

- que:
  - Don't talk about Elaine?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I don't want you to.

- que:
  - Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
  ans:
  - Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

- que:
  - Do you understand that?
  ans:
  - Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.

- que:
  - But why shouldn't I?
  ans:
  - I have my reasons.

- que:
  - I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know.

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - You're goddamn right I am.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Don't start acting hurt.

- que:
  - Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.

- que:
  - Did I say that?
  ans:
  - Of course you did.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.

- que:
  - May I stay then?
  ans:
  - Yes. Please. I want you to.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.

- que:
  - I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
  ans:
  - Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - The toothbrush. I got it all right.

- que:
  - Can I talk to you a minute?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.

- que:
  - When I go off?
  ans:
  - You don't have to tell me if you don't want.

- que:
  - What else?
  ans:
  - Nothing else.

- que:
  - No wait. Wait.
  ans:
  - Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?

- que:
  - I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
  ans:
  - Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.

- que:
  - Well why do you -- why do you think that?
  ans:
  - Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.

- que:
  - Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
  ans:
  - Not if you don't want to.

- que:
  - You believe me, don't you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't?
  ans:
  - No -- they don't.

- que:
  - Well -- when did you decide all this?
  ans:
  - About an hour ago.

- que:
  - When did you two talk this over?
  ans:
  - I guess -- about my future.

- que:
  - To be what?
  ans:
  - Different.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.

- que:
  - Have you thought about graduate school?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
  ans:
  - You got me.

- que:
  - I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
  ans:
  - Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
  ans:
  - No. She doesn't know about it.

- que:
  - She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
  ans:
  - No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.

- que:
  - Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've got to go.

- que:
  - Ben -- how old are you now?
  ans:
  - You'll never be young again.

- que:
  - How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
  ans:
  - Quite a while.

- que:
  - What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
  ans:
  - Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.

- que:
  - Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
  ans:
  - Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.

- que:
  - What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
  ans:
  - I am not threatening you.

- que:
  - You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
  ans:
  - No, I don't.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It shouldn't make any difference what happened.

- que:
  - Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - It's Benjamin.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Benjamin Braddock.

- que:
  - Benjamin -- where are you?
  ans:
  - Can you look through the glass.

- que:
  - Can you see me now?
  ans:
  - Yes, I can.

- que:
  - It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
  ans:
  - Are you ready in there, feature attraction?

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.

- que:
  - That what he says. Right?
  ans:
  - No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.

- que:
  - She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - The pearls are in her room.

- que:
  - Need any help?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I could take care of her.
  ans:
  - Have you got that skeleton key?

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...

- que:
  - Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
  ans:
  - With the pearls?

- que:
  - What about the money?
  ans:
  - I'll pay you back.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Not with strangers.

- que:
  - He must be very nice.
  ans:
  - Never?

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Whoever is keeping you waiting.

- que:
  - Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
  ans:
  - That.

- que:
  - Tea would spoil my dinner. One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
  ans:
  - You?

- que:
  - Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a... ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
  ans:
  - Very little.

- que:
  - Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
  ans:
  - Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?

- que:
  - Yes? -- Tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - We'll dance.

- que:
  - Chasing what?
  ans:
  - Money.

- que:
  - Will you do me a big favor?
  ans:
  - I'll do anything for you.

- que:
  - Would you like to make a man happy?
  ans:
  - Yes -- I'd love to.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I feel sorry for him.

- que:
  - Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
  ans:
  - Going?

- que:
  - You live here?
  ans:
  - For tonight.

- que:
  - What do you want here?
  ans:
  - Nothing -- only to be here.

- que:
  - Why do you hide in my room?
  ans:
  - But surely you must know -- because I love you.

- que:
  - Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
  ans:
  - I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that. No. I am not afraid. It is strange.

- que:
  - So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
  ans:
  - I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

- que:
  - And then --?
  ans:
  - And -- and --

- que:
  - And...?
  ans:
  - He disappeared. Later he was found dead.

- que:
  - Go away. Who are you --?
  ans:
  - A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.

- que:
  - I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
  ans:
  - I want to be alone.

- que:
  - Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
  ans:
  - Why do you smile?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.

- que:
  - Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
  ans:
  - I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.

- que:
  - Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
  ans:
  - I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.

- que:
  - What is the matter?
  ans:
  - There.

- que:
  - And now?
  ans:
  - I couldn't go through with it. Remarkable.

- que:
  - Do you understand?
  ans:
  - Yes -- yes -- yes.

- que:
  - You do believe that I really love you?
  ans:
  - Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.

- que:
  - Suzette will be back here any minute.
  ans:
  - Shall I see you again?

- que:
  - When are you leaving Berlin?
  ans:
  - Very early in the morning.

- que:
  - For Vienna?
  ans:
  - Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.

- que:
  - Why later?
  ans:
  - I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.

- que:
  - Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
  ans:
  - Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...

- que:
  - On the train?
  ans:
  - Do I know him -- I know him through and through.

- que:
  - In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
  ans:
  - Where the music's playing and the ladies are...

- que:
  - Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
  ans:
  - A little strange, Baron.

- que:
  - A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
  ans:
  - No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

- que:
  - I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
  ans:
  - Ready, Baron.

- que:
  - Is that too much, Baron?
  ans:
  - No -- not at all.

- que:
  - You've lost everything?
  ans:
  - I've no luck.

- que:
  - All of that at once, Baron?
  ans:
  - Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.

- que:
  - Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
  ans:
  - Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.

- que:
  - That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
  ans:
  - Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.

- que:
  - Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
  ans:
  - I must have made a mistake.

- que:
  - Is that for me?
  ans:
  - No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.

- que:
  - For me?
  ans:
  - No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.

- que:
  - For me?
  ans:
  - No -- letters to two-eighty.

- que:
  - No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
  ans:
  - News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.

- que:
  - What? -- Who? -- Whom?
  ans:
  - The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.

- que:
  - Good heavens. What for?
  ans:
  - No, Doctor.

- que:
  - Telegrams?
  ans:
  - No, Doctor.

- que:
  - Anyone asked for me?
  ans:
  - Nobody, Doctor.

- que:
  - Any letters?
  ans:
  - I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.

- que:
  - No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
  ans:
  - Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...

- que:
  - Barman -- whiskey -- For you, Mr. Kringelein?
  ans:
  - For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.

- que:
  - What, Doctor?
  ans:
  - A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...

- que:
  - Everything?
  ans:
  - Excuse me, gentlemen.

- que:
  - Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
  ans:
  - Oh, I've got to find it.

- que:
  - Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
  ans:
  - To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing -- Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.

- que:
  - She's beautiful -- isn't she?
  ans:
  - You must look at my face and not at the floor.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.

- que:
  - I didn't like Preysing right off.
  ans:
  - You loved the Baron, didn't you?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.

- que:
  - Later?
  ans:
  - When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...

- que:
  - Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, of course.

- que:
  - Do you like me better?
  ans:
  - Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.

- que:
  - Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
  ans:
  - No -- only occasional jobs.

- que:
  - Tired?
  ans:
  - You pay me.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - I got ten marks for that.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.

- que:
  - Skiing?
  ans:
  - Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...

- que:
  - With the same friend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're a little too fast.

- que:
  - Can't you understand me?
  ans:
  - I understand you perfectly.

- que:
  - ...weight into the balance...
  ans:
  - Have you got it now?

- que:
  - How nice -- your daughters?
  ans:
  - My daughters -- yes, my daughters.

- que:
  - Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
  ans:
  - That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.

- que:
  - Sit here. Cognac -- for you?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Well -- you want me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I must go to England -- at once.

- que:
  - I understand perfectly.
  ans:
  - Well?

- que:
  - What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
  ans:
  - Of course -- of course.

- que:
  - Can you pay some attention to me?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Come here.

- que:
  - Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
  ans:
  - Oh, no.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.

- que:
  - Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
  ans:
  - What we want to know about is Manchester.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.

- que:
  - Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
  ans:
  - We have a good many connections in England, naturally.

- que:
  - I mean with the Manchester people?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Preysing.

- que:
  - Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
  ans:
  - You've decided against the merger?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.

- que:
  - Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told. Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
  ans:
  - Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...

- que:
  - Shall I tell them again?
  ans:
  - Why waste time -- it's getting late.

- que:
  - Madam has slept well?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, Suzette.

- que:
  - I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
  ans:
  - When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.

- que:
  - Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
  ans:
  - I'm cancelling the engagement.

- que:
  - Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
  ans:
  - The house is not full -- Is it really full?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Take them back, Suzette.

- que:
  - But when did he go? How do you know?
  ans:
  - Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.

- que:
  - Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
  ans:
  - Certainly, sir.

- que:
  - Again?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
  ans:
  - I don't know you.

- que:
  - Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
  ans:
  - You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

- que:
  - What is this insolence?
  ans:
  - Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.

- que:
  - It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
  ans:
  - Yes, I know them --

- que:
  - Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
  ans:
  - Just one moment, sir.

- que:
  - How is the house?
  ans:
  - Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- Just jazz.

- que:
  - The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
  ans:
  - Four minutes past. Please come.

- que:
  - Have I kept you waiting?
  ans:
  - Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.

- que:
  - No news yet?
  ans:
  - Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.

- que:
  - Next week.
  ans:
  - Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?

- que:
  - What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

- que:
  - What's bluff?
  ans:
  - That.

- que:
  - What do you want with her?
  ans:
  - I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.

- que:
  - Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
  ans:
  - Pretty as a picture.

- que:
  - Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
  ans:
  - Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.

- que:
  - How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
  ans:
  - I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.

- que:
  - One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
  ans:
  - He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.

- que:
  - You expect me to buy this?
  ans:
  - I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.

- que:
  - You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You mean, the insurance frammis?
  ans:
  - Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.

- que:
  - And if you do it wrong?
  ans:
  - It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...

- que:
  - What's that, Lilly?
  ans:
  - Permanent damage.

- que:
  - You want a drink?
  ans:
  - Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.

- que:
  - Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
  ans:
  - Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.

- que:
  - Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
  ans:
  - A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?

- que:
  - Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
  ans:
  - I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.

- que:
  - Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
  ans:
  - Right in front of the room.

- que:
  - Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn't I, darling?
  ans:
  - Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.

- que:
  - Want a look?
  ans:
  - And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.

- que:
  - One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.

- que:
  - Why? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - You are a valued customer, as you know.

- que:
  - But what's wrong?
  ans:
  - I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.

- que:
  - I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd have to see it, of course.

- que:
  - Whadaya say?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.

- que:
  - That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
  ans:
  - Well, uh... No.

- que:
  - Well...
  ans:
  - No?

- que:
  - See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
  ans:
  - Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...

- que:
  - That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
  ans:
  - Fair enough.

- que:
  - So what's your story today?
  ans:
  - They twisted my arm.

- que:
  - Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
  ans:
  - I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.

- que:
  - Nice to see you. What am I doing in here?
  ans:
  - Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.

- que:
  - What happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.

- que:
  - Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - No. And you have to be.

- que:
  - Bluebell came in?
  ans:
  - I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't.

- que:
  - Lucky? You call that lucky?
  ans:
  - I tripped over a chair.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You don't have the stomach for it.

- que:
  - Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
  ans:
  - Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.

- que:
  - Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
  ans:
  - Roy, I don't want money from you.

- que:
  - Expecting visitors?
  ans:
  - No. That was the point.

- que:
  - I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
  ans:
  - After the meet. Back to Baltimore.

- que:
  - Going somewhere?
  ans:
  - Somewhere else, that's for sure.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
  ans:
  - Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.

- que:
  - She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.

- que:
  - I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
  ans:
  - This way's perfect.

- que:
  - Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
  ans:
  - Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.

- que:
  - At what?
  ans:
  - You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.

- que:
  - No.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - You want a drink?
  ans:
  - I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.

- que:
  - No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.

- que:
  - You're getting off the grift?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
  ans:
  - I don't see why not.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There's nothing more to talk about.

- que:
  - You heard the shower, didn't you?
  ans:
  - My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.

- que:
  - I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
  ans:
  - This time...

- que:
  - Where's the five?
  ans:
  - In your other hand.

- que:
  - Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
  ans:
  - Always, for you, baby.

- que:
  - Taking you for granite?
  ans:
  - That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Let's find out.

- que:
  - Mm?
  ans:
  - Look at me.

- que:
  - Roy? It this all we have?
  ans:
  - All? It ain't bad.

- que:
  - What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
  ans:
  - I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.

- que:
  - Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
  ans:
  - No, baby. Come to Mama.

- que:
  - You called the doctor, huh?
  ans:
  - Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah? Thanks. How long do they say I'm in here?
  ans:
  - Her job.

- que:
  - What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
  ans:
  - We'll rent a car.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.

- que:
  - Working the what?
  ans:
  - Oh, come on, Roy.

- que:
  - You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
  ans:
  - The long end. Big con.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.

- que:
  - No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
  ans:
  - And when he got serious?

- que:
  - Yeah? How?
  ans:
  - Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.

- que:
  - What happened to Cole?
  ans:
  - He retired.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Upstate.

- que:
  - Upstate where?
  ans:
  - Atascadero.

- que:
  - That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.

- que:
  - Take a hike, you mean?
  ans:
  - I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.

- que:
  - Think about it. Okay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
  ans:
  - Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Open your door.

- que:
  - What? What for?
  ans:
  - Open it and find out.

- que:
  - ) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
  ans:
  - I saw her.

- que:
  - But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
  ans:
  - Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.

- que:
  - Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
  ans:
  - The last I looked, we were just talking things over.

- que:
  - That's what I say.
  ans:
  - Don't I get any say in this?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - What I say is, no. We don't do partners.

- que:
  - For Christ's sake, why not?
  ans:
  - Bullshit!

- que:
  - What is it? What's going on?
  ans:
  - I'm happy the way I am.

- que:
  - ) What?
  ans:
  - Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.

- que:
  - Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
  ans:
  - Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.

- que:
  - Gun?
  ans:
  - It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.

- que:
  - Do you have any particular reason to say that?
  ans:
  - My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.

- que:
  - You up to it now?
  ans:
  - Sure. Let's get it over.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Ate the gun. Oh.

- que:
  - Not many laughs in this room, eh?
  ans:
  - Not many.

- que:
  - No, its -- Why did she--?
  ans:
  - That's that, then.

- que:
  - Why am I here?
  ans:
  - They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.

- que:
  - Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?
  ans:
  - I like a woman who takes control.

- que:
  - Impressive, Blake. Where'd you learn how to do that?
  ans:
  - Girl scouts.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - The cemetery...

- que:
  - You take all your dates here. Blake?
  ans:
  - Only the real stiffs.

- que:
  - Care to join me?
  ans:
  - Come on, Carter. You know it's Michael.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - It's Blake. How do you feel about Wisconsin?
  ans:
  - We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.

- que:
  - Mind if we sit down?
  ans:
  - I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy.

- que:
  - Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
  ans:
  - Detective...

- que:
  - A dead body?
  ans:
  - It's Amy Kramer.

- que:
  - Do you know who did this?
  ans:
  - Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.

- que:
  - Think Eddie had something to do with it?
  ans:
  - Doesn't look good.

- que:
  - What the fuck are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver. It was a butcher knife.

- que:
  - Who are you, the serial killer police? What difference does it make?
  ans:
  - It's not historically accurate, that's all.

- que:
  - Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
  ans:
  - My blood pleasure. You scared the hell out of me.

- que:
  - Jimmy, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - Checking out your place.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Totally. I checked all the rooms and closets...

- que:
  - Nothing's missing?
  ans:
  - Don't think so. But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.

- que:
  - My office?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.

- que:
  - Okay, you win. I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The dorms are only fifty feet away. You could practically see into my window. So, what difference does it make?
  ans:
  - My point exactly. See, we both agree.

- que:
  - I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
  ans:
  - My life is a living hell.

- que:
  - To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd never ask.

- que:
  - You're kidding with that answer, right?
  ans:
  - I just went for a walk. It's no big deal.

- que:
  - Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
  ans:
  - It's an option.

- que:
  - Oh, so now it's my fault?
  ans:
  - Just forget it...

- que:
  - You some kind of fugitive or something?
  ans:
  - I was trying to get away from someone.

- que:
  - Now you're joking, right?
  ans:
  - Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.

- que:
  - Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - I was trying to protect you from this...

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - He found you, didn't he?
  ans:
  - Get on the bus.

- que:
  - What? Where is she?
  ans:
  - John...

- que:
  - Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
  ans:
  - That would work.

- que:
  - Where'd you get it?
  ans:
  - Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.

- que:
  - You stole it?
  ans:
  - I borrowed it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I can't afford to get caught.

- que:
  - Can I come in?
  ans:
  - Are you crazy? You'll get caught.

- que:
  - You really think Eddie killed her?
  ans:
  - You saw that Michael Meyers display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.

- que:
  - Better?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
  ans:
  - Looks great. It does.

- que:
  - It's John, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It's always John.

- que:
  - Still wants to move out?
  ans:
  - He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.

- que:
  - Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
  ans:
  - Doesn't make it bad advice.

- que:
  - I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything?
  ans:
  - A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.

- que:
  - What are you looking at?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. I just need to lie down...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Michael Meyers.

- que:
  - The serial killer?
  ans:
  - He's my brother.

- que:
  - Are you going to leave, too?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
  ans:
  - Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.

- que:
  - Keri, you all right?
  ans:
  - We've got to get these kids out of here...

- que:
  - You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
  ans:
  - Wait.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I have to pee.

- que:
  - You aced it, didn't you?
  ans:
  - I did alright.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - You say, \"The key to my heart,\" and I'm gonna hurl.

- que:
  - You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
  ans:
  - Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.

- que:
  - He do that to you?
  ans:
  - Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.

- que:
  - Why? You interested?
  ans:
  - No! I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.

- que:
  - Mom -- Who is this?
  ans:
  - Kara? ... No, this is Beth.

- que:
  - Is Tim there?
  ans:
  - He's in the bathroom.

- que:
  - Whatever happened to women in back?
  ans:
  - Jesus, that's my neighbor. Tommy.

- que:
  - Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
  ans:
  - Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.

- que:
  - What if your parents come home?
  ans:
  - Then they can watch.

- que:
  - The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
  ans:
  - Aren't you gonna answer that?

- que:
  - He says things. Bad things.
  ans:
  - They did, did they? Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?

- que:
  - No one's coming to get you. Not while I'm around.
  ans:
  - Like what?

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - I promise.

- que:
  - See what I'm talkin' about?
  ans:
  - You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.

- que:
  - What is it this time?
  ans:
  - I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with. John, I want you to come with us.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I've come to help your family.

- que:
  - What makes you think he'll come here again?
  ans:
  - Jamie? But I thought she was --

- que:
  - What should I do?
  ans:
  - Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.

- que:
  - No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
  ans:
  - Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?

- que:
  - Do you know how insane this is? Who am I supposed to be looking for?
  ans:
  - Him.

- que:
  - God, what's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - Here. Let me try.

- que:
  - Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
  ans:
  - To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - It's a sign. He's come home.

- que:
  - There you are. Who was that boy?
  ans:
  - An old friend.

- que:
  - Any word on the location of the Strodes?
  ans:
  - No one's home. Checked it out myself.

- que:
  - What's wrong? What's happened to Jamie?
  ans:
  - I'll meet you over there.

- que:
  - Where's the child?
  ans:
  - This is madness, Wynn.

- que:
  - Why did you take Jamie?
  ans:
  - Jamie's baby ...

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I dunno, boy.

- que:
  - Hm?
  ans:
  - It's a bitch.

- que:
  - You know what gets me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Used to be against the law, didn't it?
  ans:
  - I suppose.

- que:
  - You know what gets me?
  ans:
  - Oh, shit.

- que:
  - Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
  ans:
  - At least we found the diamonds.

- que:
  - Can I have the Cadillac?
  ans:
  - Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.

- que:
  - So long, Colonel.
  ans:
  - What'll you do for transportation?

- que:
  - You know what gets me?
  ans:
  - I'm lonesome already.

- que:
  - And how were things?
  ans:
  - Let's talk about something else.

- que:
  - Otherwise, how are things?
  ans:
  - I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.

- que:
  - How about breakfast, wife?
  ans:
  - I dunno, boy.

- que:
  - What's funny about that?
  ans:
  - You know me, boy.

- que:
  - He and his love are like a retiarius. Do you know what a retiarius is?
  ans:
  - He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.

- que:
  - How do you know that?
  ans:
  - You told me.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.

- que:
  - Sorry.
  ans:
  - Really?

- que:
  - You keep on saying \"deep\" and \"deeply.\" I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
  ans:
  - Go to the funeral?

- que:
  - So, kid--how they hanging? Or don't you say that to a little kid?
  ans:
  - He's a man. Tell him you're a man.

- que:
  - I dunno. You know. I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
  ans:
  - I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.

- que:
  - Maybe it's time you got out.
  ans:
  - You did?

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - Hello.
  ans:
  - If what?

- que:
  - The posies are for her?
  ans:
  - I wanted to apologize.

- que:
  - Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
  ans:
  - I'd rather go to Viet Nam.

- que:
  - That can be arranged.
  ans:
  - Would somebody please pass me the catsup?

- que:
  - Fifty years?
  ans:
  - We got to get another pilot.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For Africa.

- que:
  - Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
  ans:
  - You invited me.

- que:
  - What went wrong?
  ans:
  - Gee whiz--

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Life has denied me that thrill.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I ask who you are?
  ans:
  - Mind? God, yes, I mind. I'm your father's friend. A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.

- que:
  - Is anybody besides you here now?
  ans:
  - The doctor was called away on an emergency. I think it was birth.

- que:
  - You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
  ans:
  - She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.

- que:
  - You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
  ans:
  - I'll see.

- que:
  - I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind. If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much. When did you know my father?
  ans:
  - Man and boy.

- que:
  - Even this--\"Herb Shuttle\", you said?
  ans:
  - He worships Father.

- que:
  - Ah! And what sort of man is this worshiper?
  ans:
  - He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.

- que:
  - College?
  ans:
  - She has a master's degree in English literature.

- que:
  - He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother. You know what he called Father one time?
  ans:
  - Nothing. He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.

- que:
  - He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War. Were you in a war with Father?
  ans:
  - Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.

- que:
  - England?
  ans:
  - Oh hell.

- que:
  - Uck.
  ans:
  - Dad was never in England?

- que:
  - Don't care for cold steel? A knife is worse than a bullet?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - The story gets hairier. Should I stop?
  ans:
  - Go on.

- que:
  - Where did you get the poison?
  ans:
  - Mhravitch. Remember that name.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.

- que:
  - Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
  ans:
  - They're not engaged.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.

- que:
  - I can't take my eyes off you.
  ans:
  - Is Looseleaf Harper alive?

- que:
  - She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
  ans:
  - Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?

- que:
  - Will you go to bed?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.

- que:
  - Play?
  ans:
  - Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.

- que:
  - Can I get dressed first?
  ans:
  - Leave a tip.

- que:
  - What kind of exercise?
  ans:
  - Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.

- que:
  - Who was it?
  ans:
  - It's Mom.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - That's a rifle you have?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Of course it is. Is it loaded?
  ans:
  - I don't want to fight you.

- que:
  - I think so, daughter. How old are you?
  ans:
  - Eighteen-- and a half.

- que:
  - What time do you get off work, my child?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married. My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.

- que:
  - Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
  ans:
  - I'm engaged.

- que:
  - Some kind of animal?
  ans:
  - The pelt is black. It's a kind of man.

- que:
  - How do you do, Mrs. Ryan? I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are. Am I intruding here?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Give us time.

- que:
  - What sort of time period do you have in mind? Half an hour? An hour?
  ans:
  - I don't know. This is a new disease to me.

- que:
  - Disease?
  ans:
  - Situation.

- que:
  - You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
  ans:
  - Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.

- que:
  - What's that all about?
  ans:
  - We thought a doctor might help.

- que:
  - Your old beau?
  ans:
  - We thought it was an emergency.

- que:
  - Shouldn't you lie down?
  ans:
  - When I'm dead-- or fucking.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again. What we need is a honeymoon. Let's start right now.

- que:
  - A trip, you mean?
  ans:
  - I had a trip. We'll honeymoon here. Go out and play.

- que:
  - Turn around?
  ans:
  - And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.

- que:
  - We're all going to have to go out for breakfast. The cook quit yesterday.
  ans:
  - Which one?

- que:
  - You're a woman, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Cook, by God! Cook! You're the nigger now.

- que:
  - People now have dignity when frying eggs?
  ans:
  - They don't have to feel like slaves.

- que:
  - Let me guess--breakfast is served?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What then?
  ans:
  - That's what you're supposed to say.

- que:
  - You learned this in some college course?
  ans:
  - I learned a lot of things in college. Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.

- que:
  - And what is his most cherished possession?
  ans:
  - His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess.

- que:
  - And he keeps it in his apartment?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And no one's there now?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD Goodbye.

- que:
  - A dozen?
  ans:
  - It's a big and busy funeral home.

- que:
  - Did you like it, dear?
  ans:
  - Unless she has nerve.

- que:
  - You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
  ans:
  - Well--what have we here? A family.

- que:
  - Rifle?
  ans:
  - He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.

- que:
  - And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
  ans:
  - It seems highly intelligent to me.

- que:
  - Blue soup?
  ans:
  - Sounds quite beautiful.

- que:
  - You're begging him to kill you?
  ans:
  - If he thinks he's man enough.

- que:
  - If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
  ans:
  - Honor, I suppose.

- que:
  - And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I hope he never hunts. I hope he never kills another human being.

- que:
  - You hope this, too?
  ans:
  - There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort. These elements are lacking.

- que:
  - Where's the bullet?
  ans:
  - Help your mother find the bullet.

- que:
  - How do I load?
  ans:
  - Load it for her.

- que:
  - All right! Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
  ans:
  - The National Safety Council would be appalled.

- que:
  - Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
  ans:
  - Gentlemen--that's nice.

- que:
  - The door ws unlocked. Is it always unlocked?
  ans:
  - It's always locked.

- que:
  - You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
  ans:
  - We tried to be. We tried to be.

- que:
  - Dead! Such a final word. Dead! Did you hear that?
  ans:
  - Neighbor! Doctor! I live across the hall.

- que:
  - Tough luck. You'll have to split the fee.
  ans:
  - And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?

- que:
  - Are--are you crying, Penelope?
  ans:
  - She's crying because she's so happy.

- que:
  - Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today? A touch of malaria, perhaps?
  ans:
  - I know malaria. Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.

- que:
  - Pacqualinincheewa root.
  ans:
  - You have chills?

- que:
  - Would you say that again?
  ans:
  - Pacqualinincheewa root. Means \"cougar fang.\" Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.

- que:
  - Are you've seen it work cures?
  ans:
  - Hundreds.

- que:
  - We have, have we?
  ans:
  - That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Quarantine, possibly. You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without. Goodbye.

- que:
  - This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
  ans:
  - There's a certain amount of information there.

- que:
  - What brought you back?
  ans:
  - The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. \"Honor, \" if you like.

- que:
  - There's going to be no bloodshed here. I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight, with words. The truth. Am I correct?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - We'll find out now, won't we?
  ans:
  - You're a filthy, rotten bastard.

- que:
  - Now who's being cruel?
  ans:
  - A living fossil! Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.

- que:
  - Hands and knees, you say?
  ans:
  - And terror, if you don't mind.

- que:
  - You're in one hell of a jam. You realize that?
  ans:
  - If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.

- que:
  - This is going to become very physical. Are you prepared for that?
  ans:
  - You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.

- que:
  - I'm an honorable clown?
  ans:
  - King Arthur.

- que:
  - Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
  ans:
  - Cut me open. Find out.

- que:
  - I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
  ans:
  - With spittle?

- que:
  - Was I ever of use?
  ans:
  - Never. For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.

- que:
  - More clowning! Don't you see?
  ans:
  - We never quit fighting until we're dead.

- que:
  - You'd be killing a friend. Don't you know how much I like you?
  ans:
  - I'm going to shoot you now.

- que:
  - Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
  ans:
  - If you want to be found that way.

- que:
  - What is this thing that kills me?
  ans:
  - Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders. He will soon be extinct. It's time, it's time.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.

- que:
  - Jesus--I dunno. You know. What the heck. Who knows?
  ans:
  - Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - It was a bitch.

- que:
  - And you went home unannounced, too?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I did.

- que:
  - You didn't even find that out?
  ans:
  - There was so much going on.

- que:
  - Alice is dead?
  ans:
  - No, no--shit no. Excuse me, Penelope.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - How horrible.

- que:
  - What will you do, Colonel?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess. Get a job in a motorcycle shop. So long, you guys.

- que:
  - Aha! Hello! You're Mildred, right?
  ans:
  - I heard you were looking for me.

- que:
  - You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Because he was cruel?
  ans:
  - Premature ejaculation.

- que:
  - Ja?
  ans:
  - Never mind. It's a dumb theory. I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol. Peace.

- que:
  - I had not the slightest inkling. Why didn't you say so?
  ans:
  - Kid--kid--

- que:
  - Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing. Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
  ans:
  - I worship your father. That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot? It's the proudest thing in my apartment.

- que:
  - Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - A what kind of doctor?
  ans:
  - A fairy--a queer. Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.

- que:
  - How did she lose her feet?
  ans:
  - In a railroad accident many years ago.

- que:
  - Where will you be?
  ans:
  - Anywhere but here. I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.

- que:
  - What difference does that make? Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then who flushed the toilet?
  ans:
  - Father's friend.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - That man is your father.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - There stands the loins from which you've sprung.

- que:
  - It is you, isn't it, Harold?
  ans:
  - That's why I'm crying.

- que:
  - What does he say to do?
  ans:
  - He can hardly talk.

- que:
  - It is an emergency, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're going out?
  ans:
  - We don't have a maid any more.

- que:
  - I apologize. But you didn't know him, and neither did I. How's your asthma?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it.

- que:
  - Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
  ans:
  - How's the fungus around your thumbnail?

- que:
  - I didn't get his name. A friend of your father?
  ans:
  - He isn't any friend of Father.

- que:
  - He isn't?
  ans:
  - He is my father.

- que:
  - I'll get ready, Herb. I didn't expect you this soon. Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
  ans:
  - I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.

- que:
  - Doing what?
  ans:
  - Something happens to my confidence.

- que:
  - What then?
  ans:
  - We could have had some kind of birthday party for him. We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.

- que:
  - Did you see him?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is he all right?
  ans:
  - Far as I know.

- que:
  - Is he coming home?
  ans:
  - He ditched me. He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.

- que:
  - What was it?
  ans:
  - He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.

- que:
  - We got a birthday cake, kid. Did you see the cake?
  ans:
  - Possibly.

- que:
  - Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
  ans:
  - How long has this been going on?

- que:
  - Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
  ans:
  - Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - That's the XKE.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - It's an experimental model. He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.

- que:
  - I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
  ans:
  - What kind of a life is that?

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.

- que:
  - He'd go to a movie. I think that's what he'd do. If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying. We could have him paged.
  ans:
  - Why would you do that?

- que:
  - You know each other?
  ans:
  - We met here earlier this evening.

- que:
  - It's really that bad?
  ans:
  - You fool, you fool.

- que:
  - Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
  ans:
  - Everything's going to be beautiful.

- que:
  - Is that a fact?
  ans:
  - That maid just quit. The place is a mess. You can start in the master bedroom.

- que:
  - You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide. You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
  ans:
  - Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.

- que:
  - You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
  ans:
  - He died of a massive rupture.

- que:
  - Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
  ans:
  - You're not exactly the type we're looking for.

- que:
  - You mean I'm black?
  ans:
  - No, just not the type.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.

- que:
  - I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway. Do you really think he's in danger?
  ans:
  - We aren't gonna arrest him for that...

- que:
  - Do you want to take a session?
  ans:
  - I just want to ask some questions.

- que:
  - Do you have any particular choice of girl?
  ans:
  - You'll be fine.

- que:
  - You're still dressed?
  ans:
  - Well, I want to...

- que:
  - You want a tip?
  ans:
  - Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.

- que:
  - Now, what do you want?
  ans:
  - I said I just wanted to talk to you...

- que:
  - ...about this woman. I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
  ans:
  - Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.

- que:
  - I'm getting angry. I want some answers. Where's the guy who runs this place?
  ans:
  - Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.

- que:
  - Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
  ans:
  - I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.

- que:
  - THE WINDOW How many weeks?
  ans:
  - Just one.

- que:
  - Hello. You want some information?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
  ans:
  - I don't know no Tod.

- que:
  - What girls you got here?
  ans:
  - My name is Hope. This is Faith. Charity's in back.

- que:
  - Man, how many girls do you need?
  ans:
  - I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.

- que:
  - Is this all the display space we can get?
  ans:
  - I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.

- que:
  - Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
  ans:
  - Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...

- que:
  - What's that shade of blue called?
  ans:
  - Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.

- que:
  - Sam?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...

- que:
  - Overpowering?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you sure it's all right?
  ans:
  - Yes. I think it'll look better.

- que:
  - Are you the star of this picture?
  ans:
  - You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.

- que:
  - She thinks so. What do you do?
  ans:
  - I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.

- que:
  - Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You making a feature?
  ans:
  - Um-hm. Live sound.

- que:
  - You know her?
  ans:
  - No. I saw her with Tod.

- que:
  - Do you know where she lives?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Tod might know.

- que:
  - Where's he?
  ans:
  - Last I heard he went to San Diego.

- que:
  - Something like that. How much do you make?
  ans:
  - Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.

- que:
  - Three hundred?
  ans:
  - This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.

- que:
  - Up front?
  ans:
  - Half now, half later.

- que:
  - Tonight. When you get out, we'll go. Why didn't you tell the other detective?
  ans:
  - This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.

- que:
  - I thought you were going to bed?
  ans:
  - I am.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.

- que:
  - You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
  ans:
  - I don't drink, but you can go out.

- que:
  - You don't drink?
  ans:
  - Ulcers.

- que:
  - You're not a private detective either, are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
  ans:
  - A friend.

- que:
  - Of Joanne's?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm her father.

- que:
  - And your wife? Where's she?
  ans:
  - She's dead.

- que:
  - What rate?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm talking about.

- que:
  - Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
  ans:
  - You don't understand shit.

- que:
  - You used to work at Copper Penny?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why? Are you a sex fiend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How important do you think sex is?
  ans:
  - Not very.

- que:
  - What do you care about?
  ans:
  - I care about my daughter.

- que:
  - What's T-J?
  ans:
  - Tijuana.

- que:
  - They were here?
  ans:
  - Tod was. He was with Ratan.

- que:
  - What does that mean? What does he do?
  ans:
  - He deals in pain.

- que:
  - So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - You really believe all that?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Well, mostly.

- que:
  - Why can't I meet him now?
  ans:
  - Rot in hell, honey. He's busy now.

- que:
  - On your own land?
  ans:
  - Look, I really don't know your daughter but...

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.

- que:
  - Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
  ans:
  - Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.

- que:
  - Granville?
  ans:
  - Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you that.

- que:
  - Well, what do they know?
  ans:
  - Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.

- que:
  - ...What do you have to offer?
  ans:
  - If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.

- que:
  - Who's paying you?
  ans:
  - You are.

- que:
  - Mast?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
  ans:
  - I've got a meeting...

- que:
  - What are you paying me for?
  ans:
  - I'll be there.

- que:
  - What have you found out?
  ans:
  - I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you know what a \"hardcore\" movie is?
  ans:
  - That's like a stag film.

- que:
  - Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - They are?
  ans:
  - Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where did you get that film?
  ans:
  - I bought it at a store in L.A.

- que:
  - Who made it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What's it called?
  ans:
  - It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.

- que:
  - Do the police want to arrest me?
  ans:
  - Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.

- que:
  - I just heard. Who is he?
  ans:
  - It's just a name.

- que:
  - Does she know anything about this?
  ans:
  - Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.

- que:
  - What happened, pilgrim?
  ans:
  - Just leave me alone.

- que:
  - You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
  ans:
  - No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.

- que:
  - What is it, Jake?
  ans:
  - Wes, Anne, come here a moment.

- que:
  - Is Marsha there?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.

- que:
  - How's your business, Jake?
  ans:
  - Pretty good.

- que:
  - How did you find me?
  ans:
  - Wes, do me a favor.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.

- que:
  - What is going on?
  ans:
  - I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.

- que:
  - What plan?
  ans:
  - You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.

- que:
  - That's not true, Mr...?
  ans:
  - Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.

- que:
  - Where is she? Where is the girl?
  ans:
  - She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.

- que:
  - Where does he hang out?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What you got in mind?
  ans:
  - I want to meet Ratan.

- que:
  - You're talking about real excitement?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...

- que:
  - Who told you about this?
  ans:
  - Rucker.

- que:
  - Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - What do you want? Do I know you from somewhere?
  ans:
  - I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - That film was a fake! Everything's phony...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.

- que:
  - They're all about the same. You want something?
  ans:
  - This is from the movie I was talking about.

- que:
  - I'm just trying to find... Who owns this store?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.

- que:
  - You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - In other words, you want to get laid?
  ans:
  - Not exactly...

- que:
  - I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
  ans:
  - Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.

- que:
  - Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
  ans:
  - Hold it, mister.

- que:
  - He asked me. You going with anybody?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You never heard of that?
  ans:
  - Com'on, tell me.

- que:
  - What does that do?
  ans:
  - Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.

- que:
  - Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
  ans:
  - Maybe. Maybe not.

- que:
  - To his own daughter?
  ans:
  - To anybody.

- que:
  - You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
  ans:
  - My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - The guy who bought you that ring.

- que:
  - Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
  ans:
  - Jake'll take care of me.

- que:
  - At least I improved myself. What's up?
  ans:
  - I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.

- que:
  - You working in San Diego now?
  ans:
  - I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.

- que:
  - Was he with a girl?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You are at the University, Candy?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am.

- que:
  - And what are you studying?
  ans:
  - Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.

- que:
  - Eh, Poli Sci?
  ans:
  - Political Science. It's all about what's going on.

- que:
  - Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
  ans:
  - I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.

- que:
  - Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How long have you been driving?
  ans:
  - About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.

- que:
  - Isn't this your vehicle?
  ans:
  - No, no. I just took it.

- que:
  - Took it?
  ans:
  - Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.

- que:
  - Haven't we met before?
  ans:
  - None of that, lady.

- que:
  - Is this your shovel?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
  ans:
  - Check.

- que:
  - And that truck - is it registered in your name?
  ans:
  - Oh no! Not in my name.

- que:
  - I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
  ans:
  - Wait here.

- que:
  - What kind of a car is it?
  ans:
  - Oh. It looks like a hearse. Very nice. Compact.

- que:
  - Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
  ans:
  - Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.

- que:
  - And what do you do, my dear?
  ans:
  - I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.

- que:
  - Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
  ans:
  - Edith was just telling me about her job.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.

- que:
  - A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one. Tell me, what do you see?
  ans:
  - A block of ice.

- que:
  - What do you see?
  ans:
  - I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.

- que:
  - You're welcome. Did you know him?
  ans:
  - Eh, no.

- que:
  - Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Oh, of course. What is your name?
  ans:
  - Harold Chasen.

- que:
  - Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. I have my car.

- que:
  - Do you sing and dance?
  ans:
  - Eh, no.

- que:
  - Well, it's a new experience for me. Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
  ans:
  - But this is my car.

- que:
  - Oh.
  ans:
  - Your hearse?

- que:
  - And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
  ans:
  - Not any car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.

- que:
  - Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
  ans:
  - Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.

- que:
  - But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Oh, at the dentist's?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - How about some ginger pie?
  ans:
  - Eh, fine.

- que:
  - I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's fine. Fine.

- que:
  - Do you often model for Glaucus?
  ans:
  - Me! No. Of course not.

- que:
  - Really. Do you think it's wrong?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - A self-portrait. But over here is my favorite. It's titled \"Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant.\" Do you like it?
  ans:
  - Yes. Very much.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Oh. Eh, I like it.

- que:
  - Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
  ans:
  - You don't look eighty.

- que:
  - I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so tall and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Just one of those.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Because they are all the same.

- que:
  - The universal language of mankind. What music do you like, Harold?
  ans:
  - Well...

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Look.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Over there by the courthouse.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.

- que:
  - But what?
  ans:
  - But this is public property.

- que:
  - Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
  ans:
  - Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.

- que:
  - Is he all right?
  ans:
  - He's fallen asleep, as usual.

- que:
  - What is that he's working on?
  ans:
  - An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.

- que:
  - A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
  ans:
  - Well, I really don't drink...

- que:
  - What were you fighting for?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - Superb.

- que:
  - Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
  ans:
  - Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.

- que:
  - Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
  ans:
  - Well -- - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.

- que:
  - Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Maude, do you pray?
  ans:
  - Pray? No. I communicate.

- que:
  - With God?
  ans:
  - With Life.

- que:
  - Well, why don't you?
  ans:
  - No. I'd feel stupid.

- que:
  - Want to join me in some cartwheels?
  ans:
  - No. I feel more like - yodeling.

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - From the guys who got the matches, of course.

- que:
  - What is it, Harold?
  ans:
  - They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.

- que:
  - Maude, do you think you can help me?
  ans:
  - What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.

- que:
  - Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
  ans:
  - Don't you advance on me.

- que:
  - How about some candy floss?
  ans:
  - Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.

- que:
  - Do you think there is any life up there?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Perhaps.

- que:
  - Why are there no photographs in these frames?
  ans:
  - I took them out.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'll never forget you, Maude. But I would like a photo of you.

- que:
  - Farewell?
  ans:
  - Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.

- que:
  - But you're not going anywhere, are you?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.

- que:
  - But why now?
  ans:
  - I thought eighty was a good round number.

- que:
  - Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
  ans:
  - Mother.

- que:
  - Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
  ans:
  - I'm getting married.

- que:
  - To whom?
  ans:
  - To a girl. Here.

- que:
  - Love? Love? What do you know about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
  ans:
  - At a funeral.

- que:
  - How do you do?
  ans:
  - Can't complain.

- que:
  - Would you like a cigarette?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

- que:
  - No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
  ans:
  - Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.

- que:
  - Oh, is this your father?
  ans:
  - No. My uncle.

- que:
  - Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
  ans:
  - An ancient Japanese ceremony.

- que:
  - Like a tea ceremony?
  ans:
  - No. Like this.

- que:
  - Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
  ans:
  - An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.

- que:
  - And why is that?
  ans:
  - Just give me a rough estimate.

- que:
  - No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
  ans:
  - I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.

- que:
  - Does that worry you?
  ans:
  - Yes. It does.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I put a lot of effort into these things.

- que:
  - I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What about the draft?
  ans:
  - My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.

- que:
  - Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
  ans:
  - You mean when I'm not working on a...

- que:
  - I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
  ans:
  - No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.

- que:
  - What else do you like?
  ans:
  - I go to funerals.

- que:
  - You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - None at all?
  ans:
  - Well, maybe one.

- que:
  - Would you care to talk about this friend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I see. Were you happy at school, Harold?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:

  - Your classmates?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Your studies?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Then why did you leave?
  ans:
  - I burnt down the Chemistry building.

- que:
  - I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
  ans:
  - No. I'd have liked to.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'd have liked to talk to him.

- que:
  - What would you say?
  ans:
  - I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.

- que:
  - What kind of stuff?
  ans:
  - Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.

- que:
  - You think so, sir?
  ans:
  - Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.

- que:
  - How about hand-to-hand combat?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How about to slit his throat?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't...

- que:
  - Souvenirs?
  ans:
  - Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.

- que:
  - Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.

- que:
  - Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
  ans:
  - Oh yes. That's fine.

- que:
  - Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Oh, yes. How did you like that?
  ans:
  - Well, I didn't.

- que:
  - Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
  ans:
  - It's different for us.

- que:
  - You knew?
  ans:
  - Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.

- que:
  - Yes... Yes. You look...
  ans:
  - Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?

- que:
  - Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
  ans:
  - No. You look...

- que:
  - You a doctor, too?
  ans:
  - Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.

- que:
  - What's the matter with her?
  ans:
  - Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.

- que:
  - No bad dreams.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - So you slept O.K.?
  ans:
  - Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...

- que:
  - And you're sure it was a woman?
  ans:
  - God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The Boxes. In the House. I told you.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - The boxes! I TOLD you.

- que:
  - Kyle, you don't have...
  ans:
  - Are you crazy?

- que:
  - I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
  ans:
  - I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.

- que:
  - Finish what?
  ans:
  - I'm scared.

- que:
  - Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
  ans:
  - And what about you?

- que:
  - What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
  ans:
  - Steve...

- que:
  - What are you talking about? Who are you?
  ans:
  - Oh, excuse me...

- que:
  - He talked about Demons, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The Cenobites.

- que:
  - See what?
  ans:
  - The past, the future, whatever this object holds.

- que:
  - Is he serious?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.

- que:
  - Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
  ans:
  - Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.

- que:
  - Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
  ans:
  - Red. How long was it latched onto you?

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - In private, if you don't mind...

- que:
  - You are a Catholic?
  ans:
  - Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.

- que:
  - Air and sea backup. What's closest?
  ans:
  - Cordon off the area. Something came through.

- que:
  - C'mon -- Rasputin?
  ans:
  - No. It was red. Bright red.

- que:
  - Oh, as opposed to -- ?
  ans:
  - They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.

- que:
  - How does he know so much about me?
  ans:
  - Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe. \"Unique.\" That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.

- que:
  - On the desk, yes. In Latin.
  ans:
  - Where am I -- exactly, Sir?

- que:
  - 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
  ans:
  - Impressive. Do you remember what it said?

- que:
  - Did he, now?
  ans:
  - Agent Myers is your new liaison.

- que:
  - Got tired of me?
  ans:
  - Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.

- que:
  - \"Myers\", huh? You have a first name?
  ans:
  - Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.

- que:
  - Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years, He's barely out of his teens.
  ans:
  - Grounded? Who's grounded?

- que:
  - Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
  ans:
  - Uh-oh -- John. Staring at what?

- que:
  - No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
  ans:
  - That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight. You know monsters.

- que:
  - What are you trying to say?
  ans:
  - In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left, you.

- que:
  - You call that thing a cigar?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - No one ever helps me. It's my job.
  ans:
  - Father's back? Still angry?

- que:
  - My arm is fine. Where are you?
  ans:
  - Goodbye.

- que:
  - What took you so long?
  ans:
  - C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.

- que:
  - What are you, a Boy Scout?
  ans:
  - No. I never was.

- que:
  - You want me to hold him down?
  ans:
  - That's right, Stud, hold me down.

- que:
  - I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
  ans:
  - Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Hostage negotiations.

- que:
  - Are you sure about this?
  ans:
  - On a scale of one to ten, two. But -- -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.

- que:
  - How big can it be?
  ans:
  - For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.

- que:
  - You're going alone?
  ans:
  - No. Myers is taking me.

- que:
  - It's freezing, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Coffee's warming me up.

- que:
  - What -- ?
  ans:
  - That you feel that way about me.

- que:
  - -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Pardon?
  ans:
  - Two steps back, please.

- que:
  - Look, do you want the bed in or not?
  ans:
  - Just take it slowly.

- que:
  - Want to buy a bed?
  ans:
  - Not much.

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - We're leaving.

- que:
  - Will you sign for the bed?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - That your daughter?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
  ans:
  - The box... you opened it. We came.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.

- que:
  - You did this before, right?
  ans:
  - Many times.

- que:
  - To a man called Frank Cotton?
  ans:
  - Nobody escapes us.

- que:
  - Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
  ans:
  - Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.

- que:
  - You want it?
  ans:
  - Come to Daddy.

- que:
  - That's right. Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm brother Frank.

- que:
  - There is going to BE a wedding?
  ans:
  - Oh. Oh yes.

- que:
  - Well can I come in or not?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I don't want to see the dress.

- que:
  - Wedded bliss?
  ans:
  - I'm very happy.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I said, don't look.

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.

- que:
  - -- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
  ans:
  - Back from where?

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.

- que:
  - Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
  ans:
  - Later.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.

- que:
  - A box?
  ans:
  - It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.

- que:
  - What kind of doors?
  ans:
  - Hell...

- que:
  - Who did?
  ans:
  - You're still afraid.

- que:
  - It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
  ans:
  - Yes. They'll never find us.

- que:
  - So where's the harm?
  ans:
  - I said no.

- que:
  - Don't you care?
  ans:
  - There's very little I can do about it.

- que:
  - Which is where?
  ans:
  - Just to your left.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.

- que:
  - What's the problem?
  ans:
  - I have to see my father.

- que:
  - You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
  ans:
  - I was here this afternoon.

- que:
  - Maybe somebody changed the lock.
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?

- que:
  - It's just been empty a while.
  ans:
  - Like who?

- que:
  - How long since you were here?
  ans:
  - The best part of ten years.

- que:
  - Why didn't he want to sell it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.

- que:
  - I thought half of it was your brother's?
  ans:
  - He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.

- que:
  - You mean we're moving in?
  ans:
  - You're still blaming me.

- que:
  - So what's the argument?
  ans:
  - No argument.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - In here.

- que:
  - He's here?
  ans:
  - He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - We'll move in Sunday.

- que:
  - How are you doing through there?
  ans:
  - It looks like a bomb's dropped.

- que:
  - What have you done?
  ans:
  - I cut myself.

- que:
  - Is it deep?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.

- que:
  - Julia?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Just feeling a bit sick.

- que:
  - Can I get you anything?
  ans:
  - Maybe a brandy.

- que:
  - Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
  ans:
  - O.K.

- que:
  - Who was it?
  ans:
  - Kirsty.

- que:
  - Is this upsetting you?
  ans:
  - I've seen worse.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Oh baby.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Please...

- que:
  - What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Please. I can't bear it...

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I don't know where to begin...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Drinking alone.

- que:
  - What are you drinking?
  ans:
  - Just soda.

- que:
  - Plain soda?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - You know it's not often I... you know...

- que:
  - You want something to drink?
  ans:
  - I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.

- que:
  - Well, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I... suppose so, yes.

- que:
  - So, what's your problem? Let's get to it. You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
  ans:
  - No. No. Let's go upstairs.

- que:
  - Do you care ?
  ans:
  - No, not much.

- que:
  - No personal details?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - We don't need a bed, do we?
  ans:
  - I suppose not.

- que:
  - Why don't you do the same?
  ans:
  - Maybe I will.

- que:
  - Am I?
  ans:
  - You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.

- que:
  - What happened to me?
  ans:
  - I won't be a moment.

- que:
  - Try me.
  ans:
  - I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?

- que:
  - Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
  ans:
  - Steve.

- que:
  - Kirsty?
  ans:
  - I got through.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - I found a room.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I said, I found a room.

- que:
  - I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
  ans:
  - No Dad.

- que:
  - Do you want me to come over?
  ans:
  - Well I want you to see the house.

- que:
  - Well come over, will you? See the place?
  ans:
  - I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.

- que:
  - I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
  ans:
  - You will keep in touch.

- que:
  - You like?
  ans:
  - Me like.

- que:
  - Is Julia here?
  ans:
  - Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.

- que:
  - Are you O.K.?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What are you drinking, love?
  ans:
  - I've forgotten.

- que:
  - Steve?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.

- que:
  - You don't like her at all do you?
  ans:
  - She doesn't even want to leave the house.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - It's like she's waiting for something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.

- que:
  - Finished?
  ans:
  - He's gone.

- que:
  - Gone?
  ans:
  - Poor Frank. He's better off dead.

- que:
  - What's the problem?
  ans:
  - I have to get out.

- que:
  - You're not going?
  ans:
  - Just upstairs.

- que:
  - Need any help?
  ans:
  - I AM house-trained.

- que:
  - Please. I want to see you home. All right?
  ans:
  - All right. No. That's nice.

- que:
  - What do we do if there isn't?
  ans:
  - We walk.

- que:
  - Meaning what?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.

- que:
  - There ya go. I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - We're not all frigid.

- que:
  - Oh no?
  ans:
  - I've been better.

- que:
  - Are you busy after work ?
  ans:
  - Just trying to get my apartment in order.

- que:
  - Steve. Thank God you came.
  ans:
  - Can I lend you a hand?

- que:
  - I won't let anybody take you.
  ans:
  - What happened to you?

- que:
  - Sure. Why not?
  ans:
  - Bye.

- que:
  - Do I know you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.

- que:
  - What's next?
  ans:
  - Since you brought that bullshit tape in.

- que:
  - Well what's the point in that?
  ans:
  - Nice, Barry.

- que:
  - Oh, so what's the point then?
  ans:
  - I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.

- que:
  - \"Our customers?\" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
  ans:
  - Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.

- que:
  - What did he ever do to you?
  ans:
  - He offended me with his terrible taste.

- que:
  - What did you tell her about the shop for?
  ans:
  - We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all! All three of us.

- que:
  - What are you snickering about?
  ans:
  - I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.

- que:
  - What am I missing? What do you have to be happy about?
  ans:
  - Okay. Top five side one track ones. Number one... \"Janie Jones,\" the Clash, from The Clash.

- que:
  - Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all. Dick, did you hear that?
  ans:
  - Shut up. \"Let's Get It On,\" Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. \"Airbag,\" Radiohead, from OK Computer.

- que:
  - Just... come on, what would it mean to you? That sentence? \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?\"
  ans:
  - -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --

- que:
  - Yeah, yeah, I know. But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" what would you think?
  ans:
  - I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.

- que:
  - Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
  ans:
  - Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...

- que:
  - But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
  ans:
  - How the fuck am I supposed to know that? You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.

- que:
  - Why would they care?
  ans:
  - Because it's a brilliant film. It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

- que:
  - I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
  ans:
  - Let's pack it up. We haven't had a customer in four hours.

- que:
  - How do you know about that?
  ans:
  - Shut the fuck up, Barry.

- que:
  - What the fuck is that?
  ans:
  - My band.

- que:
  - What band?
  ans:
  - The band that found me and asked me to join.

- que:
  - Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance?
  ans:
  - I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments.

- que:
  - Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
  ans:
  - That's why you got the gig, isn't it?

- que:
  - So much for friends, then. You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
  ans:
  - Bitter? Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk. Just keep that out of my window.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Laura. Her dad died.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I heard you, man. Don't give me that \"what\" shit. You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.

- que:
  - HELLO. DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson? Mr. Phil Spector?
  ans:
  - Like fuck you are.

- que:
  - I'm looking for a record for my daughter. For her birthday. \"I Just Called To Say I Love You.\" Do you have it?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. We got it.

- que:
  - Great. Can I have it then?
  ans:
  - No, you can't.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - What's your problem? What did I... Why are you --

- que:
  - Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
  ans:
  - They always seemed...

- que:
  - That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television?
  ans:
  - No. The Righteous Brothers.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I just prefer the other one.

- que:
  - Who are you going to see?
  ans:
  - Nobody.

- que:
  - Oh, hi.
  ans:
  - Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda?

- que:
  - May I help you?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

- que:
  - Right. Why?
  ans:
  - Oh. Okay.

- que:
  - So. Is now a good time?
  ans:
  - Right. So. You must have an enormous record collection.

- que:
  - Pardon me?
  ans:
  - Your desert island top-five.

- que:
  - Is there a difference?
  ans:
  - Nevermind. Any five. So four more.

- que:
  - Can I go home and work this out and let you know? In a week or so?
  ans:
  - Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter. I'll do one. My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.

- que:
  - Is that it?
  ans:
  - Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.

- que:
  - Yeah.
  ans:
  - Sure, but is that it for the list?

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - Who? Oh. My friend. My friend is Laura. A girl. A friend who's a girl.

- que:
  - Okay. \"Dance Music For Old People?\"
  ans:
  - \"Music for Old People.\" What does that mean?

- que:
  - Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what? Why don't I just make you a tape?
  ans:
  - Would you? Really? Wow. I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.

- que:
  - Yeah. A billion. Right... How are you?
  ans:
  - Uh...yes, at the moment.

- que:
  - Why did you break up with me for Marco?
  ans:
  - Fuck! I knew it! You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.

- que:
  - Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
  ans:
  - Oh God, no. I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

- que:
  - Good weekend?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.

- que:
  - Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
  ans:
  - I always hated this song.

- que:
  - You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it.
  ans:
  - Liz, hold on a second -- What?

- que:
  - Can I do anything?
  ans:
  - \"Abraham, Martin, and John.\" That's a nice one.

- que:
  - Laura? Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I am fine... I gotta go. Goodbye.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - Hello, Rob. Remember me? I'm Ray. Ian.

- que:
  - What needs sorting out?
  ans:
  - Come on, Rob. My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.

- que:
  - Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
  ans:
  - I dunno.

- que:
  - Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
  ans:
  - I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.

- que:
  - Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
  ans:
  - We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever.

- que:
  - So shall we leave it at that then?
  ans:
  - I dunno.

- que:
  - Are you coming home?
  ans:
  - Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.

- que:
  - My house?
  ans:
  - How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.

- que:
  - But don't you remember?
  ans:
  - I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it.

- que:
  - And do you like it that way?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - So. Where have you been staying for the last week?
  ans:
  - I think you know that.

- que:
  - Good. So. Is it my job?
  ans:
  - What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.

- que:
  - What were the others?
  ans:
  - Just the obvious stuff.

- que:
  - What's the obvious stuff?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
  ans:
  - Rob. Don't be childish.

- que:
  - So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
  ans:
  - Of course it is.

- que:
  - You really think it would make a difference either way?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Never?
  ans:
  - I haven't felt like it.

- que:
  - But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
  ans:
  - The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.

- que:
  - I'll look for 'em. How you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...

- que:
  - Have you slept with him yet?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.

- que:
  - Will you call me?
  ans:
  - I don't have your number.

- que:
  - I figured it was. Where are you?
  ans:
  - I'm not -- hold on...

- que:
  - Are you still in love with me?
  ans:
  - Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.

- que:
  - You don't ever think about other people?
  ans:
  - No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.

- que:
  - Is that the last of it?
  ans:
  - Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.

- que:
  - Those look heavy. Where's Ian?
  ans:
  - It was kind of funny.

- que:
  - You still together? Going all right?
  ans:
  - I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.

- que:
  - That bad, eh?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean.

- que:
  - I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
  ans:
  - Ray. I hate Ian.

- que:
  - Guess who I just saw, right by my store? Ian. In Starbuck's. Neat, huh?
  ans:
  - I can't talk right now.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Pigsty.

- que:
  - Who the fuck's Pig?
  ans:
  - My dad died. My dad, my dad.

- que:
  - No, no. When are you going home?
  ans:
  - In a minute. When I get it together.

- que:
  - Do you want me to be there?
  ans:
  - I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.

- que:
  - Look, are you coming or not?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course.

- que:
  - Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
  ans:
  - Uh... No.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it.

- que:
  - What do you want to do?
  ans:
  - C'mon.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later.

- que:
  - No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.

- que:
  - I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used?
  ans:
  - Look, we can do other things.

- que:
  - What about Ian?
  ans:
  - Mission accomplished.

- que:
  - Let's go home. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Want to know what, exactly?
  ans:
  - What it was like.

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - You know the difference.

- que:
  - Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
  ans:
  - To make you feel better.

- que:
  - How? How were we the same people?
  ans:
  - No, but...

- que:
  - But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
  ans:
  - And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...

- que:
  - Less neurotic. Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
  ans:
  - I'm alright.

- que:
  - All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself. Otherwise, what's the use?
  ans:
  - No use.

- que:
  - Hi. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - WHAT?
  ans:
  - Just local, of course.

- que:
  - That's not the point. I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
  ans:
  - Barry said its done.

- que:
  - Barry? Barry knows about this?
  ans:
  - Yeah. His band is playing a set.

- que:
  - Are you worried about tomorrow night?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
  ans:
  - I'm going to talk to you.

- que:
  - What are you going to talk to me about?
  ans:
  - I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not. To me.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
  ans:
  - Not in love, exactly, but...

- que:
  - Would you marry me if I was?
  ans:
  - No. Probably not.

- que:
  - Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Are you persuadable?
  ans:
  - Fair enough.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else.

- que:
  - I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Didn't think about it, really. It was the asking that was the important thing.

- que:
  - You called this morning?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I just wanted to thank you for that message last night. It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.

- que:
  - So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
  ans:
  - It's a crematorium.

- que:
  - Isn't that how it is for everybody?
  ans:
  - Enough, Liz.

- que:
  - Only because it's never the time. I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
  ans:
  - If by \"we\" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.

- que:
  - So you live in Chicago now?
  ans:
  - Yup. Not far from here, actually.

- que:
  - Don't you like that?
  ans:
  - No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.

- que:
  - Everything go alright?
  ans:
  - She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually.

- que:
  - Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - You share a place with T-Bone?
  ans:
  - I understand completely.

- que:
  - Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
  ans:
  - For now. But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.

- que:
  - Good. In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink. You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
  ans:
  - Whiskey.

- que:
  - So you'll stay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Would you like me to turn the lights out? Or would you like them on?
  ans:
  - God, you ask a lot of questions.

- que:
  - That way. You?
  ans:
  - That way.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Hi, Rob. It's your mother.

- que:
  - Everything all right?
  ans:
  - Great. Super-fantastic.

- que:
  - How's the store?
  ans:
  - So so. Up and down.

- que:
  - What do you mean? Where did she go?
  ans:
  - How would I know? Gone. Girlfriend. Leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out.

- que:
  - Hello? Anybody there?
  ans:
  - I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.

- que:
  - I knew this would happen. What are you going to do Rob?
  ans:
  - I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed. Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.

- que:
  - And after that?
  ans:
  - Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.

- que:
  - What did Laura say? Do you know why she left?
  ans:
  - It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - It's the best collection I've ever seen.

- que:
  - And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
  ans:
  - It must have taken him a long time to get them together.

- que:
  - Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
  ans:
  - Sure. Ten cents.

- que:
  - Oh really. You two are slamming to Nico now?
  ans:
  - I think you have more.

- que:
  - Records are those big round black things, right?
  ans:
  - Fuck off.

- que:
  - What's the name of your label?
  ans:
  - Maybe he's hiding from something.

- que:
  - How old is Richard?
  ans:
  - P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.

- que:
  - Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Doesn't have a head, does he?
  ans:
  - This one came unassembled.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Scottish claymore. Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.

- que:
  - Would you like more tea?
  ans:
  - No thank you, I'm fine.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Then you didn't know Richard later on.

- que:
  - The boy _died_?
  ans:
  - Mother too. Sad case it was. The young lady just couldn't make it through labor. Never even saw her son.

- que:
  - Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
  ans:
  - There was this one fella. Asked a lot of questions. I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.

- que:
  - Would you remember his name?
  ans:
  - Carl Smith.

- que:
  - Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Anything in Maryland is close.

- que:
  - Do you play?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
  ans:
  - I'd like to ask you about the claymore.

- que:
  - Byzantine?
  ans:
  - Basil the II.

- que:
  - Grave robbers?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - People like that rarely leave business cards.

- que:
  - Does Carl Smith?
  ans:
  - I don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Tradition.

- que:
  - What the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - He tried to kill me last night.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Dupont Circle.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - At the moment? Carl Smith.

- que:
  - What will you do now?
  ans:
  - You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.

- que:
  - That bothers you?
  ans:
  - He was innocent.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - I'm a witness to a murder. That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.

- que:
  - Have you gone to the police?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No one knows you're here?
  ans:
  - No. I had to talk to you.

- que:
  - Is this what you killed them with?
  ans:
  - You've been listening to rumors.

- que:
  - What's all that?
  ans:
  - Richard Taupin has become cumbersome. It would be best if he just disappeared.

- que:
  - When you finish, what then?
  ans:
  - I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.

- que:
  - No. So what now? We just wait?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why are you here?
  ans:
  - I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write. But it's not. It's you.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - That would be difficult to explain.

- que:
  - What about that family in '31?
  ans:
  - Sometimes innocents become involved.

- que:
  - You kill with your left hand?
  ans:
  - I haven't killed _you_.

- que:
  - Is that a threat?
  ans:
  - Don't.

- que:
  - What is it like? Being you?
  ans:
  - But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.

- que:
  - What is it you want?
  ans:
  - All of it finished.

- que:
  - Will I see you again?
  ans:
  - Be careful. Don't stay any longer than you have to.

- que:
  - I'll destroy you. I've destroyed everything I've ever touched! Oh God...
  ans:
  - What's wrong?

- que:
  - The emptyness. The years and years of void. Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
  ans:
  - The inheritance.

- que:
  - Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - I'm calling an attorney.

- que:
  - Four?
  ans:
  - All fashionably without heads.

- que:
  - What are you getting at, Moran?
  ans:
  - It'll never stick.

- que:
  - What were you doing in Felton?
  ans:
  - Research. If your pal was there I never saw him.

- que:
  - It's that important?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Not who. What. Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He's too cool. Too sharp. I think he's got something to do with it.

- que:
  - I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved. It's just a hunk of peasant iron. Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
  ans:
  - Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over. He has one, he might have two.

- que:
  - Afternoon.
  ans:
  - You see that desk? _Your_ desk? You see the crap piled up on it?

- que:
  - Your name is Conor?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
  ans:
  - Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.

- que:
  - And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - How can you know this?
  ans:
  - First food, no? A good meal makes conversation so much easier.

- que:
  - Hmm, que rico. What is it you call this?
  ans:
  - Pheasant.

- que:
  - Why are you here?
  ans:
  - I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.

- que:
  - Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
  ans:
  - Yes. Always.

- que:
  - Does it change with me in the room?
  ans:
  - It is less.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We are immortal.

- que:
  - What is to become of me? Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
  ans:
  - You will live. Survive.

- que:
  - You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
  ans:
  - Aye.

- que:
  - How can I stop such a man?
  ans:
  - Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn. You must learn to defend yourself. In this I can help.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - We are brothers. And you are a defense- -of sorts.

- que:
  - And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
  ans:
  - The Fabric of life. The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.

- que:
  - And you?
  ans:
  - I am a small player. But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.

- que:
  - I'm your future husband, remember?
  ans:
  - I have no future husband.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.

- que:
  - That's mad. Surely you don't take their word?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Conor. It's not natural. Maybe something has touched you.

- que:
  - What would you like?
  ans:
  - Something pretty.

- que:
  - That's wonderful. Where did you ever learn it?
  ans:
  - Far away.

- que:
  - Who am I deceiving?
  ans:
  - Certainly not me.

- que:
  - Complete your inspection?
  ans:
  - They're nothing but boys. It will be a slaughter tomorrow.

- que:
  - Your name?
  ans:
  - Mulet.

- que:
  - What is your position?
  ans:
  - Second musketeer.

- que:
  - Equals?
  ans:
  - If you wish to play games, Major.

- que:
  - You are really going to force this, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Either you are with me or against me.

- que:
  - Have you time for some- thing to eat?
  ans:
  - Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.

- que:
  - Must he go?
  ans:
  - Aye. It is his duty. All of ours.

- que:
  - Where did you learn that?
  ans:
  - My father taught me.

- que:
  - Figure she's with him?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Any other I.D.s come up?
  ans:
  - Not yet. Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon. Y'never know.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Round up who you can and put them on standby.

- que:
  - Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
  ans:
  - No. I want this to be all ours.

- que:
  - What name is he using?
  ans:
  - Smith. Carl Smith.

- que:
  - How many came?
  ans:
  - The last four.

- que:
  - And the Bulgarian?
  ans:
  - He got him. He always does. Eventually.

- que:
  - He knows I'm here. How?
  ans:
  - None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...

- que:
  - Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
  ans:
  - Sit.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Head still secure to the neck.

- que:
  - How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
  ans:
  - Old habits die hard. Waitress! A round of Nitzhic! Peasant drool, I know. But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - It is the gathering, my friend. The settling of old scores.

- que:
  - And have you something to settle with me?
  ans:
  - Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.

- que:
  - How do you do it, Kahn? How do you live so full of life for so long?
  ans:
  - Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have. All else is just marking time. You're marking time.

- que:
  - Friend of yours?
  ans:
  - Of sorts.

- que:
  - What's the point?
  ans:
  - This isn't done. Get up.

- que:
  - Are you here?
  ans:
  - I want you to come to me.

- que:
  - And if I refuse?
  ans:
  - Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.

- que:
  - This your present address?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
  ans:
  - I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your men came right after.

- que:
  - Did you know the victim?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way. He'd also been in the country less than a week. What is your citizenship?
  ans:
  - American.

- que:
  - What are you getting at?
  ans:
  - Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.

- que:
  - What were _you_ looking for?
  ans:
  - That's none of your business.

- que:
  - Do you know what this is?
  ans:
  - I presume it's a sword.

- que:
  - Your murder weapon?
  ans:
  - It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.

- que:
  - Where were you Tuesday night?
  ans:
  - Home.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - All I need is time.

- que:
  - The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, more than enough.

- que:
  - You're one of William's kids, huh?
  ans:
  - His only kid.

- que:
  - When may I expect the cleaners?
  ans:
  - I'll send them right up.

- que:
  - Why don't you fellows get your own news?
  ans:
  - This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.

- que:
  - Are you back?
  ans:
  - No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.

- que:
  - What doing?
  ans:
  - I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.

- que:
  - Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. Mervyn, isn't it?
  ans:
  - No. Roy. Roy V.

- que:
  - I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
  ans:
  - My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.

- que:
  - Too hot?
  ans:
  - No. It's strong. But I like it that way.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
  ans:
  - Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.

- que:
  - But --
  ans:
  - I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
  ans:
  - The five hundred? Sure.

- que:
  - Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
  ans:
  - Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

- que:
  - All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
  ans:
  - Fine. And here's a kiss for you.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - I lost my wallet.

- que:
  - Yes, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.

- que:
  - Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
  ans:
  - The Criminal Courts Building.

- que:
  - BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
  ans:
  - Not through any help of yours, Hildy.

- que:
  - Where'd she go?
  ans:
  - Out some place.

- que:
  - Hildy! Where's mother?
  ans:
  - Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.

- que:
  - Did you give her the money?
  ans:
  - This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.

- que:
  - Oh.
  ans:
  - Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.

- que:
  - But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
  ans:
  - Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.

- que:
  - Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
  ans:
  - Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.

- que:
  - Well, I'll try to give her one.
  ans:
  - Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?

- que:
  - I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
  ans:
  - Just for the first year.

- que:
  - How's business, Bruce?
  ans:
  - Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.

- que:
  - Anything the matter?
  ans:
  - Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.

- que:
  - Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
  ans:
  - It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.

- que:
  - Are you sure Williams is not all there?
  ans:
  - All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.

- que:
  - How long would the interview take?
  ans:
  - Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.

- que:
  - Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
  ans:
  - No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.

- que:
  - The money? Why?
  ans:
  - There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.

- que:
  - Gee! Take a look, will you?
  ans:
  - You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.

- que:
  - No? Well -- Johnson, you're under arrest. You, too, Burns.
  ans:
  - You'll ask me to what?

- que:
  - Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
  ans:
  - You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.

- que:
  - We'll just start by impounding the Post property. Is that your desk?
  ans:
  - Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.

- que:
  - Do you want to get us scooped?
  ans:
  - You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.

- que:
  - Out of the mouths of babes.
  ans:
  - What's this?

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.

- que:
  - Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
  ans:
  - No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.

- que:
  - Done what?
  ans:
  - Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.

- que:
  - Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
  ans:
  - Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.

- que:
  - You've had a better offer, eh?
  ans:
  - You bet I've got a better offer.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Sweeney.

- que:
  - I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
  ans:
  - Dead?

- que:
  - Bermuda... Rich, eh?
  ans:
  - Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.

- que:
  - What's his line?
  ans:
  - He's in the insurance business.

- que:
  - It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.

- que:
  - He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
  ans:
  - I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.

- que:
  - Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
  ans:
  - Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.

- que:
  - Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
  ans:
  - The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you. So long, Walter, and better luck next time.

- que:
  - Say, could I meet him?
  ans:
  - Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.

- que:
  - All right then, come on and let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
  ans:
  - Better.

- que:
  - Then what does he want with you?
  ans:
  - Now you got me.

- que:
  - No kidding?
  ans:
  - And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.

- que:
  - Thank you.
  ans:
  - What for?

- que:
  - What now?
  ans:
  - You said it.

- que:
  - If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
  ans:
  - Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.

- que:
  - All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
  ans:
  - Exclusive? That's great.

- que:
  - No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?
  ans:
  - That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.

- que:
  - Yes. Where is he?
  ans:
  - She jumped out of the window.

- que:
  - We're going to take him over to my private office. Where's our phone?
  ans:
  - All the words you've got.

- que:
  - Where's Bruce?
  ans:
  - Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.

- que:
  - What tickets?
  ans:
  - Railroad tickets.

- que:
  - Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
  ans:
  - Hildy, you think I could? After this story? Here! You're just nervous.

- que:
  - Was she? Did you notice?
  ans:
  - It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.

- que:
  - Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
  ans:
  - What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?

- que:
  - Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?
  ans:
  - Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.

- que:
  - Shut up, will you? You sure? Nobody?
  ans:
  - Duffy!!!! Duffy!!!! Well, where is Duffy? Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease. Louie.

- que:
  - Ring that number, will you?
  ans:
  - Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.

- que:
  - Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.

- que:
  - Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
  ans:
  - I don't know what to do, Walter.

- que:
  - No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
  ans:
  - All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?

- que:
  - On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - What would you do if it was a daughter?
  ans:
  - Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.

- que:
  - What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
  ans:
  - That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.

- que:
  - Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
  ans:
  - How about Bruce's?

- que:
  - Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
  ans:
  - What's that -- what's that?

- que:
  - I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
  ans:
  - You stay here. I'll find out everything.

- que:
  - Who do you want?
  ans:
  - You know me. The shirt off my back.

- que:
  - You got plenty of money?
  ans:
  - He's on my phone. He just called me.

- que:
  - I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
  ans:
  - No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.

- que:
  - Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
  ans:
  - It's a deal. Let me up.

- que:
  - First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
  ans:
  - The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.

- que:
  - Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.

- que:
  - You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
  ans:
  - The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.

- que:
  - I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
  ans:
  - In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.

- que:
  - Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
  ans:
  - Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.

- que:
  - Three bullets! Any good?
  ans:
  - Beats king up.

- que:
  - Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
  ans:
  - Who locked the door?

- que:
  - Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
  ans:
  - Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.

- que:
  - Give me a hand with her, will you?
  ans:
  - Okay. Up you go, Mollie.

- que:
  - What have you got, Hildy?
  ans:
  - Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.

- que:
  - Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
  ans:
  - She says she's gonna write fiction.

- que:
  - You guys wanna play some more poker?
  ans:
  - What's the use? I can't win a pot.

- que:
  - Boy, did you see her go?
  ans:
  - Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.

- que:
  - Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
  ans:
  - Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.

- que:
  - Three sixes. Is that any good?
  ans:
  - We know what you're up to.

- que:
  - How's everything, Gus?
  ans:
  - I can't complain.

- que:
  - Little rum in yours, too?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - Just coffee. And you, sir?
  ans:
  - Same way you did. Through that gate.

- que:
  - Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.

- que:
  - Where'd you get this?
  ans:
  - I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - With a bag of marshmallows.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.

- que:
  - I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
  ans:
  - You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.

- que:
  - For who?
  ans:
  - Earl Williams. The reprieve.

- que:
  - Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
  ans:
  - Did you actually give Williams that gun?

- que:
  - Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
  ans:
  - I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.

- que:
  - Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours? Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
  ans:
  - We'll fix that, too.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Shoot to kill, I said.

- que:
  - Who is this man?
  ans:
  - Throw him out, Frank.

- que:
  - That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
  ans:
  - I won't.

- que:
  - Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
  ans:
  - I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.

- que:
  - Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
  ans:
  - I can't.

- que:
  - You can let him out on bail, can't you?
  ans:
  - Five hundred dollars.

- que:
  - My name is Louis Peluso.
  ans:
  - Editorials?

- que:
  - What did you do with her?
  ans:
  - Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.

- que:
  - -- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
  ans:
  - Was I? The driver got knocked cold.

- que:
  - Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
  ans:
  - Who is it?

- que:
  - What's the matter? Getting yellow?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.

- que:
  - Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
  ans:
  - Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.

- que:
  - Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
  ans:
  - I made it up just now, and who's asking you? I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.

- que:
  - No -- what?
  ans:
  - If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.

- que:
  - Where's the money?
  ans:
  - Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here. One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.

- que:
  - Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
  ans:
  - No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?

- que:
  - Any dope yet on how he got out?
  ans:
  - From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.

- que:
  - I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
  ans:
  - Hiding him where?

- que:
  - How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
  ans:
  - \"Production for use only.\" Well, maybe that's the answer.

- que:
  - Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
  ans:
  - Very simple, Earl.

- que:
  - No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
  ans:
  - Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.

- que:
  - Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
  ans:
  - Don't forget about production for use.

- que:
  - Don't talk too loud.
  ans:
  - Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?

- que:
  - Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
  ans:
  - Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.

- que:
  - What good'll it do?
  ans:
  - Wait a minute, Mollie.

- que:
  - What's the idea?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.

- que:
  - What's from the Governor?
  ans:
  - Forty dollars.

- que:
  - Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
  ans:
  - Who? Me?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.

- que:
  - For heaven's sake, why not?
  ans:
  - This puts me in a peculiar hole.

- que:
  - Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.

- que:
  - What's your hurry?
  ans:
  - We want to see you.

- que:
  - What's he want?
  ans:
  - Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.

- que:
  - Can I try?
  ans:
  - Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.

- que:
  - Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
  ans:
  - Apparently so.

- que:
  - I know a secret.
  ans:
  - Yes, she did, didn't she?

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.

- que:
  - They're not.
  ans:
  - Who told you that?

- que:
  - You want to join our gang?
  ans:
  - I don't mind.

- que:
  - Do you know any swear words?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Won't they have maps?
  ans:
  - They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.

- que:
  - Who with?
  ans:
  - Pauline.

- que:
  - Can't we just see the end?
  ans:
  - They've got the real thing outside.

- que:
  - It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
  ans:
  - Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.

- que:
  - You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
  ans:
  - Well, for the baby, really.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.

- que:
  - We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
  ans:
  - It was great for me, how was it for you.

- que:
  - Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
  ans:
  - They might be.

- que:
  - Air-raid?
  ans:
  - Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.

- que:
  - I don't know?
  ans:
  - You do, you do. You're just not saying.

- que:
  - What about it?
  ans:
  - Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You need trees for an avenue.

- que:
  - How's your war, Mac?
  ans:
  - Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.

- que:
  - I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
  ans:
  - There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You joined up.

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - Jam.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - You taste it.

- que:
  - You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - Why didn't they say that before you started?
  ans:
  - I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.

- que:
  - What are you going to be then?
  ans:
  - A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.

- que:
  - When do you think you'll get leave again?
  ans:
  - Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.

- que:
  - Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
  ans:
  - After this dance.

- que:
  - What would we do if a German came into the house?
  ans:
  - Don't be silly, Dawn.

- que:
  - Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
  ans:
  - Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.

- que:
  - And where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - Out.

- que:
  - What is it, pet?
  ans:
  - He's being posted. I was terrible to him.

- que:
  - What did he say?
  ans:
  - He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.

- que:
  - Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
  ans:
  - Now take deep breaths, and push.

- que:
  - Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
  ans:
  - Up to six weeks, I think.

- que:
  - Wasn't it lovely?
  ans:
  - It was the best time of his life.

- que:
  - I can't do it. What's the point?
  ans:
  - It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.

- que:
  - ...since I used to take you to the Proms?
  ans:
  - That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.

- que:
  - Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
  ans:
  - A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.

- que:
  - Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
  ans:
  - You might still have a house.

- que:
  - What did I do to deserve this?
  ans:
  - You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.

- que:
  - I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
  ans:
  - I know you mean well.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Cone.

- que:
  - Huh... what cone?
  ans:
  - Any cone, yeah... I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.

- que:
  - What about R.J.?
  ans:
  - Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.

- que:
  - Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis?
  ans:
  - Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.

- que:
  - Where's that?
  ans:
  - Couple more miles up this road.

- que:
  - What about the tree?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, the tree.

  ans:
  - Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.

- que:
  - Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
  ans:
  - Well, yeah, kind of.

- que:
  - Is your brother ready to go?
  ans:
  - Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.

  ans:
  - Um, yeah sure, I guess.

  ans:
  - A dead one.

- que:
  - Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
  ans:
  - What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.

- que:
  - Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
  ans:
  - That's not something to joke about.

- que:
  - Can I help you with something?
  ans:
  - I was just wondering.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You know... a couple of queers.

- que:
  - Do you believe this fucking girl?
  ans:
  - I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.

- que:
  - What the hell are you laughing about?
  ans:
  - I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.

- que:
  - Why? You gonna do something about it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'll do something.

- que:
  - Now, what makes you think that?
  ans:
  - You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.

- que:
  - Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - Yeah, yeah... ...I like to fuck shit up.

- que:
  - I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya... ...Goober?
  ans:
  - Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.

- que:
  - Great story Goober, how much?
  ans:
  - Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.

- que:
  - How long have you been running this place?
  ans:
  - How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.

- que:
  - The Duke?
  ans:
  - Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.

- que:
  - You mean John Wayne?
  ans:
  - Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about? A great American.

- que:
  - I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
  ans:
  - I don't drive cross country.

- que:
  - Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
  ans:
  - If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.

- que:
  - How awesome?
  ans:
  - Really fucking awesome.

- que:
  - Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
  ans:
  - Hell yeah.

- que:
  - I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It's a hitchhiker.

- que:
  - Way out here?
  ans:
  - She looks like she stinks.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - Fuck. I think we blew a tire.

- que:
  - Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
  ans:
  - Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.

- que:
  - Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
  ans:
  - I like sleep.

- que:
  - Yeah, showtime for what?
  ans:
  - Just grin and bear it.

- que:
  - Should we stop?
  ans:
  - We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.

- que:
  - Why are we stopping?
  ans:
  - There's a dog in the road.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Fine. I'll go straight.

- que:
  - How much is a person supposed to stand?
  ans:
  - Quiet.

- que:
  - Come on, get with the facts.
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?

- que:
  - What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
  ans:
  - Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.

- que:
  - Can I get some stamps off ya? Did you fix the toilet yet?
  ans:
  - Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.

- que:
  - Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
  ans:
  - No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.

- que:
  - How long is that gonna take?
  ans:
  - He should be back in a couple hours.

- que:
  - You sure you don't need any help in there?
  ans:
  - No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Grab Mary and come inside.

- que:
  - Tickets for what?
  ans:
  - This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.

- que:
  - Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
  ans:
  - That seems likely.

- que:
  - Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
  ans:
  - Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.

- que:
  - You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
  ans:
  - I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - When you were outside with Bill.

- que:
  - What are you laughing at?
  ans:
  - I don't know, I think he's funny.

- que:
  - Hello... ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.

- que:
  - Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
  ans:
  - Aw, shit... I gotta pee anyway.

- que:
  - Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
  ans:
  - It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.

- que:
  - How long has it been?
  ans:
  - I don't know... about half an hour.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - What? I didn't hear anything.

- que:
  - Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
  ans:
  - Don't be such a fucking smart ass.

- que:
  - What'd we here, Georgie?
  ans:
  - A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.

- que:
  - Recover any bodies?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - You find something, Georgie?
  ans:
  - Yep, I found something.

- que:
  - What'd ya got there?
  ans:
  - Keys.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Open up the trunk.

- que:
  - What do they call you, sweety?
  ans:
  - Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.

- que:
  - So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
  ans:
  - Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.

- que:
  - Didn't ya think, Mary?
  ans:
  - I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.

- que:
  - Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
  ans:
  - For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Just back up.

- que:
  - I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
  ans:
  - I'll go. It's my fault.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - That stupid hillbilly slut.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please.

- que:
  - Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
  ans:
  - My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

- que:
  - I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
  ans:
  - Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.

- que:
  - No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
  ans:
  - Grampa... watch the language.

- que:
  - What! God damn, how many?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I only saw one.

- que:
  - What should I do?
  ans:
  - Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.

- que:
  - George Willis... ...any leads?
  ans:
  - Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.

- que:
  - Fit the profile?
  ans:
  - No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.

- que:
  - Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
  ans:
  - Over here, inside the smokehouse.

- que:
  - Mr. Willis?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - What about the body you found?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.

- que:
  - Yeah... ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man... ...you know, like in the comics.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - And think about what you've done.

- que:
  - It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.

- que:
  - How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
  ans:
  - Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.

- que:
  - As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
  ans:
  - Let's go eat, I'm starved.

- que:
  - French?
  ans:
  - Oui.

- que:
  - Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
  ans:
  - Oui, doctor, oui.

- que:
  - Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we?
  ans:
  - Oui.

- que:
  - No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
  ans:
  - Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?

- que:
  - Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...

- que:
  - I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
  ans:
  - Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.

- que:
  - I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
  ans:
  - Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.

- que:
  - Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you?
  ans:
  - Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.

- que:
  - Is everything fine?
  ans:
  - Oui. Now you've got me talking French.

- que:
  - Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?
  ans:
  - Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.

- que:
  - When you were a little French girl?
  ans:
  - Oui.

- que:
  - Shall we close up, then?
  ans:
  - Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.

- que:
  - It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
  ans:
  - Yes. Happy happy.

- que:
  - What is wrong, my darling?
  ans:
  - Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.

- que:
  - I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
  ans:
  - You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.

- que:
  - Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
  ans:
  - Hmmmph.

- que:
  - Gabby, what is it?
  ans:
  - Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Hi. It's Nathan.

- que:
  - Call you back. You bastard! What do you want?
  ans:
  - I just want to talk.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Well, I think...

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - God, you're beautiful.

- que:
  - Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
  ans:
  - You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?

- que:
  - That's Lila?
  ans:
  - A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.

- que:
  - Where do we look for little lost Puff?
  ans:
  - I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.

- que:
  - But I like being human now.
  ans:
  - That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.

- que:
  - You still in the market for a real boy?
  ans:
  - Always. Ow.

- que:
  - I don't get that. Is that sexual?
  ans:
  - Shut up and tell me.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.

- que:
  - Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
  ans:
  - My brother is discreet.

- que:
  - Won't he be able to tell?
  ans:
  - God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.

- que:
  - One night stand?
  ans:
  - No. I married a midget.

- que:
  - Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
  ans:
  - I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Three foot one.

- que:
  - No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking \"do not disturb\" sign on the fucking doorknob?
  ans:
  - Lila, it's Rosie.

- que:
  - How'd you know where I was?
  ans:
  - Nathan told my brother.

- que:
  - Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
  ans:
  - I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.

- que:
  - You are a therapist, right?
  ans:
  - No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.

- que:
  - Paper or cloth?
  ans:
  - I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.

- que:
  - What's the larger experiment?
  ans:
  - It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.

- que:
  - Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yes, and...

- que:
  - You really enjoy my company?
  ans:
  - Yes. Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yeah But I have some peculiarities also.

- que:
  - I don't care. I don't care! Like what, for example?
  ans:
  - I'll be out in a minute.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Of course. I simply love the... naturalness of it all.

- que:
  - Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
  ans:
  - Yes, darling.

- que:
  - Oh, and the sun block?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - What SPF, sweetie?
  ans:
  - Fifteen.

- que:
  - I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Flares?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Something.

- que:
  - A deer?
  ans:
  - No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.

- que:
  - You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
  ans:
  - I think he's feral.

- que:
  - Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
  ans:
  - Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five, The human subject.

- que:
  - What are you doing in there?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Be right out.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.

- que:
  - Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
  ans:
  - It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Your entire body?
  ans:
  - I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...

- que:
  - Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
  ans:
  - You are an animal.

- que:
  - So, how's it going today?
  ans:
  - Good. Making progress.

- que:
  - Do you like my new look?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Sure. Of course.

- que:
  - You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?
  ans:
  - No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.

- que:
  - Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.

- que:
  - How come?
  ans:
  - Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...

- que:
  - I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
  ans:
  - Such as what womanly things?

- que:
  - Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
  ans:
  - Ummm. It's good.

- que:
  - So he's doing okay?
  ans:
  - Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.

- que:
  - And what did you do tonight, honey?
  ans:
  - I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.

- que:
  - And what did you do tonight, honey?
  ans:
  - I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.

- que:
  - Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
  ans:
  - Lila...

- que:
  - Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
  ans:
  - Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.

- que:
  - Lila?
  ans:
  - Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.

- que:
  - Extra dessert?
  ans:
  - Even better.

- que:
  - It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
  ans:
  - I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.

- que:
  - Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
  ans:
  - Ugnh.

- que:
  - Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
  ans:
  - Unka unka unka unka unka.

- que:
  - I have to talk. Is that okay?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No, why?
  ans:
  - Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.

- que:
  - Mother?
  ans:
  - Yes... Derek.

- que:
  - Boys just passing through?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Pittsburgh?
  ans:
  - Mm hmm.

- que:
  - Comin' in or goin' out?
  ans:
  - Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.

- que:
  - What do you guys sell?
  ans:
  - Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.

- que:
  - Hey, he's right! Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
  ans:
  - About sixty, seventy bucks.

- que:
  - You want a chaser?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
  ans:
  - Packard. Sarah Packard.

- que:
  - It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
  ans:
  - No, I'm fine.

- que:
  - You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
  ans:
  - I've never been to Louisville.

- que:
  - Oh, I forgot all about it. How's the hands?
  ans:
  - It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.

- que:
  - You know what's good for him?
  ans:
  - To win.

- que:
  - For whom and for what?
  ans:
  - For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.

- que:
  - You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
  ans:
  - All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - You tell me.

- que:
  - Are you ready for another?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
  ans:
  - It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.

- que:
  - Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
  ans:
  - That's the way it's done.

- que:
  - You ever played billiards before?
  ans:
  - I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Oh, about five hundred.

- que:
  - Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
  ans:
  - I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.

- que:

  - For who?
  ans:

  - How're the hands?
  ans:
  - They're fine.

- que:
  - Tell her what?
  ans:
  - Half.

  ans:
  - Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.

- que:

- que:
  - Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
  ans:

  ans:
  - So am I... Sit down. Would you get us a couple of drinks?

- que:
  - What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
  ans:
  - I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.

- que:
  - Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
  ans:
  - Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.

  - This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back. What for? To take another beating?
  ans:
  - I told you you'd get your money back.

  ans:
  - Oh yeah? Where?

- que:
  - What for? To play Fats again?
  ans:
  - Yeah, to play Fats again.

- que:
  - Is that what you think?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's what I think.

- que:
  - Just like that?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Just like that.

- que:
  - Now and then. Why, do you?
  ans:
  - A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - You're very direct, Mr. Felson.

- que:
  - What time?
  ans:
  - I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.

- que:
  - You gentlemen care for a drink?
  ans:
  - No, none for me. Come on, let's play.

- que:
  - Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
  ans:
  - Oh no, nothing for me.

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - There it is. I'm broke.

- que:
  - Who's he?
  ans:
  - Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.

- que:
  - What's the limit?
  ans:
  - Half and a dollar.

- que:
  - How much you playin' for?
  ans:
  - A dollar on the five, two on the nine.

- que:
  - You quittin' too?
  ans:
  - You're a pretty good player.

- que:
  - How much are you ahead?
  ans:
  - Couple of bucks.

- que:
  - I guess it's just you and me, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.

- que:
  - You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
  ans:
  - You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.

- que:
  - You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
  ans:
  - Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.

- que:
  - You quittin', friend?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm quittin'.

- que:
  - Long wait for a bus?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How long have you been waiting?
  ans:
  - Since four.

  - Just a cup of black coffee, please... Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute! Would you, uh, like another cup?
  ans:
  - Fine, thanks.

- que:
  - What bus?
  ans:
  - Yours.

- que:
  - That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
  ans:
  - Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.

- que:
  - Have a nice trip?
  ans:
  - Fair.

- que:
  - Can I sit down?
  ans:
  - Why not? We already know each other's secrets.

- que:
  - Can I buy you another drink?
  ans:
  - It's the lights. And the scotch.

- que:
  - How come you didn't catch your bus?
  ans:
  - I wasn't waiting for a bus.

- que:
  - Same reason you went, at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
  ans:
  - Around.

- que:
  - Do you always ask so many questions?
  ans:
  - No, not always.

- que:
  - Yeah? What do you do now?
  ans:
  - I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.

- que:
  - So why go to college?
  ans:
  - I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

- que:
  - What do you do on the other days?
  ans:
  - Eddie. The name is Eddie.

- que:
  - The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.

- que:
  - I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
  ans:
  - I could always get us a bottle.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
  ans:
  - No. I'll take you home.

- que:
  - Why did you do that?
  ans:
  - I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.

- que:
  - What time is it?
  ans:
  - Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Come here.

- que:
  - How did you know my name was Sarah?
  ans:
  - You told me.

- que:
  - Okay. So what's your name today?
  ans:
  - Sarah. Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.

- que:
  - Where you been all day?
  ans:
  - At school. It's Thursday.

- que:
  - You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.

- que:
  - Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
  ans:
  - Museums... art galleries... concerts.

- que:
  - You want to go with me?
  ans:
  - Mm hmm.

- que:
  - You got it all in your head?
  ans:
  - When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.

- que:
  - What did all this stuff cost you?
  ans:
  - When you've got money, you'll pay.

- que:
  - Eggs. How do you like them?
  ans:
  - Raw.

- que:
  - Haven't you opened it?
  ans:
  - No, why should I? It's yours.

- que:
  - You going out?
  ans:
  - Yeah. For a little while.

- que:
  - What are you writing?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.

- que:
  - What's this supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - You'll find yourself another rich old lover.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Me. It's Eddie.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I got beat up. They... They broke my thumbs.

- que:
  - A loser?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.

- que:
  - Would he know?
  ans:
  - He knows. A lot.

- que:
  - Why did he tell you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.

- que:
  - What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
  ans:
  - He's a gambler.

- que:
  - Is he a winner?
  ans:
  - Well, he owns things.

- que:
  - Does it bother you? What he said?
  ans:
  - You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.

- que:
  - You need the words?
  ans:
  - Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.

- que:
  - You glad?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm glad.

- que:
  - Well, what's so funny?
  ans:
  - Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.

  ans:
  - Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know.

- que:
  - A week? A year?
  ans:
  - More like a week. Look, I'll be back.

- que:
  - Don't you want to know where I'm going?
  ans:
  - No. Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.

- que:
  - Why should I?
  ans:
  - Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.

- que:
  - Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
  ans:
  - Fifty-seven.

- que:
  - Where's Bert?
  ans:
  - He went off someplace.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Just for luck.

- que:
  - Well, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - I'm a little tired.

- que:
  - Is that a fact?
  ans:
  - Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.

  - Where do you come from?
  ans:
  - California. Oakland.

  - California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
  ans:

- que:
  - Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
  ans:
  - Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.

- que:
  - Hundred dollars?
  ans:
  - Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.

- que:
  - You miss? Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
  ans:
  - That's what the game's all about.

- que:
  - That's good, Eddie. For how much?
  ans:
  - You name it.

- que:
  - Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How much do you remember?
  ans:

  - When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
  ans:
  - Dark and large. With vines -- no, not vines. Not alive.

  ans:
  - My wife.

- que:
  - Was this -- \"beautiful?\" Before?
  ans:
  - Yes.

  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Good evening. Did you have a pleasant day today?
  ans:
  - Busy. I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle. A big vehicle.

- que:
  - That sounds charming. Did you meet any interesting people today?
  ans:
  - Yesterday. They're back. Haven't seen them for a few months. I have to be careful.

- que:
  - Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
  ans:
  - They are... sinister. They want to kill me.

- que:
  - That sounds charming. What are you planning to do tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Stay alive.

- que:
  - I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Need some gas?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - I guess you could say that.
  ans:
  - So, what do you do?

- que:
  - Bathroom?
  ans:
  - Round back.

- que:
  - Son ... are you awake?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do we have to?
  ans:
  - I know, son. But you'll like it where we're going. I'm getting a good job. It's a pretty part of the country.

- que:
  - What's that, Dad?
  ans:
  - That's the Air Force Base.

- que:
  - Is the hill ours too?
  ans:
  - If we want it, it is.

- que:
  - Why, Dad?
  ans:
  - Because the sky is so clear out here.

- que:
  - And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
  ans:
  - Which one's that? The dull, red one.

- que:
  - What did it look like?
  ans:
  - It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.

- que:
  - Are you all right, Dad?
  ans:
  - Sure ... fine.

- que:
  - Was there anything over the hill?
  ans:
  - I had an awful dream.

- que:
  - What, Jim, what?
  ans:
  - First lemme look at your necks.

- que:
  - Better now, son?
  ans:
  - I'll take you to school.

- que:
  - What happened to you? Who was that?
  ans:
  - That's Ed. Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.

- que:
  - Where's your car?
  ans:
  - I left it at work.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Ellen?
  ans:
  - It's his nightmare. He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.

- que:
  - What do you mean -- gone? What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner. I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.

- que:
  - What did he talk to you about?
  ans:
  - He was upset with moving, I believe.

- que:
  - Why, yes. Why?
  ans:
  - Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.

- que:
  - May I ask why?
  ans:
  - We were having a little talk.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.

- que:
  - Mr. Gardner, I --
  ans:
  - Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.

- que:
  - This is a new town for you. Do you like it here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not? Moving is hard for anybody. Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
  ans:
  - I don't have many friends. Dad's all the time moving.

- que:
  - That's quite a story. You know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
  ans:
  - She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge. She must've been behind the hill.

- que:
  - What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
  ans:
  - I'd believe him.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause he wouldn't lie.

- que:
  - Do you know how to follow a map?
  ans:
  - Yes. I can even read star maps.

- que:
  - Where, Jimmy?
  ans:
  - Behind my house, up on the ridge.

- que:
  - Does it look to you like anything landed here?
  ans:
  - Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.

- que:
  - Who are you calling?
  ans:
  - The State Police.

- que:
  - Did you call the State Police?
  ans:
  - All their lines were busy.

- que:
  - Let's try.
  ans:
  - What is it?

- que:
  - You're looking for life?
  ans:
  - They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.

- que:
  - What do you think he saw? Could it have been something from the air base?
  ans:
  - No, Mom. It wasn't a plane.

- que:
  - What happened to your other slipper?
  ans:
  - Your father asked you a question.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - This afternoon. It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.

- que:
  - What kind, Mom?
  ans:
  - Oh, I can't remember. But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.

- que:
  - Gardner? Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here. Why?
  ans:
  - His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance. I couldn't get a thing out of him.

- que:
  - What's his family background?
  ans:
  - They're from out of state. Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.

- que:
  - Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
  ans:
  - Why, yes.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - You have to leave the White House.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Connie, don't hang up.

- que:
  - David? How'd you get this number?
  ans:
  - Walk to the window. Right in front of you.

- que:
  - And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
  ans:
  - Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - I want you to leave with us. Right now.

- que:
  - You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
  ans:
  - David, don't...

- que:
  - Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
  ans:
  - We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.

- que:
  - Did it work?
  ans:
  - You bet it did.

- que:
  - Spunky. He told you about that?
  ans:
  - All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.

- que:
  - Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
  ans:
  - More than likely.

- que:
  - What the hell is this?
  ans:
  - So sue me.

- que:
  - Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
  ans:
  - Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.

- que:
  - What's the bad news?
  ans:
  - You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.

- que:
  - That's the good news?
  ans:
  - ...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.

- que:
  - Haven't you been watching?
  ans:
  - Tell her to get the kids and leave town.

- que:
  - Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
  ans:
  - Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.

- que:
  - A countdown to what?
  ans:
  - Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - Checkmate.

- que:
  - You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
  ans:
  - You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.

- que:
  - You still got the Olds?
  ans:
  - You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.

- que:
  - Can't this thing go any faster?
  ans:
  - You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.

- que:
  - And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
  ans:
  - Dad...

- que:
  - What the hell is that?
  ans:
  - This, pops, is every phone book in America.

- que:
  - You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
  ans:
  - She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...

- que:
  - Not listed, huh?
  ans:
  - I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...

- que:
  - Spunky?
  ans:
  - College nickname.

- que:
  - You try Martin?
  ans:
  - She didn't take my name when we were married.

- que:
  - It's perfect the line is busy?
  ans:
  - Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.

- que:
  - Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
  ans:
  - Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.

- que:
  - You punched the President in the face?
  ans:
  - He wasn't the President then.

- que:
  - It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
  ans:
  - A cold? Of course.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - Just getting a feel for her.

- que:
  - Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
  ans:
  - Looks like they're preparing the invasion.

- que:
  - What're you doing?
  ans:
  - It's not me. They're overriding the system.

- que:
  - Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
  ans:
  - Then God help us.

- que:
  - Is my wife in the air?
  ans:
  - She should be shortly.

- que:
  - Any news on my wife?
  ans:
  - The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - ETA with target; four minutes.

- que:
  - Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
  ans:
  - And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.

- que:
  - And our forces?
  ans:
  - We're being exterminated.

- que:
  - How're we doing?
  ans:
  - Better than we thought.

- que:
  - And our troops here?
  ans:
  - We've been collecting planes from all over but...

- que:
  - But what, General?
  ans:
  - Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.

- que:
  - Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.

- que:
  - Grey, you read me?
  ans:
  - Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.

- que:
  - Where's it headed?
  ans:
  - It had been deemed classified.

- que:
  - How long would their shields be down?
  ans:
  - With their shields down it might be possible.

- que:
  - A meteor?
  ans:
  - No Sir. Definitely not.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - Well, er... it's slowing down.

- que:
  - It's doing what?
  ans:
  - It's... slowing down, Sir.

- que:
  - They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
  ans:
  - Wait. I have to tell you something.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Be careful.

- que:
  - Really? You don't mind?
  ans:
  - Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.

- que:
  - Sorry for what?
  ans:
  - I should have done this a long long time ago.

- que:
  - Was his father stationed here?
  ans:
  - He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.

- que:
  - So, what do you do for a living?
  ans:
  - I'm a dancer.

- que:
  - Really? Ballet?
  ans:
  - No. Exotic.

- que:
  - And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
  ans:
  - Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.

- que:
  - I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
  ans:
  - He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?

- que:
  - Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.

- que:
  - Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - We're leaving, don't try and stop us.

- que:
  - For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
  ans:
  - I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.

- que:
  - Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
  ans:
  - I'm not leaving.

- que:
  - What the hell's going on?
  ans:
  - We're leaving.

- que:
  - Above American soil?
  ans:
  - If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.

- que:
  - Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
  ans:
  - Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.

- que:
  - Where do your people come from? Where is your home?
  ans:
  - Here... now.

- que:
  - And before here?
  ans:
  - Many worlds...

- que:
  - Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance? Can there be peace between us?
  ans:
  - Peace? No peace.

- que:
  - What do you want us to do?
  ans:
  - Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.

- que:
  - Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
  ans:
  - Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...

- que:
  - May we go home now, please?
  ans:
  - The dog!? You are named after the dog...

- que:
  - Dad?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.

- que:
  - Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
  ans:
  - The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.

- que:
  - Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

- que:
  - Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
  ans:
  - Where?

- que:
  - How's the head?
  ans:
  - It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. \"Alexandretta?\" Hmmm...

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.

- que:
  - Schneider?
  ans:
  - I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.

- que:
  - Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
  ans:
  - I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...

- que:
  - Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
  ans:
  - This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.

- que:
  - You could be more right than you know.
  ans:
  - Where did this come from?

- que:
  - You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
  ans:
  - I usually don't.

- que:
  - Find something?
  ans:
  - Bingo.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Pretty sure.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.

- que:
  - Don't wander off.
  ans:
  - Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?

- que:
  - Mine, too.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What were they looking for?
  ans:
  - This.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No. You like the way I do things.

- que:
  - What do you know about this place?
  ans:
  - I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Don't know. Think of something.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

- que:
  - How did you get here?
  ans:
  - Where is it? I want it.

- que:
  - You came back for the book? Why?
  ans:
  - My father didn't want it incinerated.

- que:
  - Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
  ans:
  - You do.

- que:
  - I came to get you! What do you think?
  ans:
  - Oh, it breaks the heart.

- que:
  - Through the library?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
  ans:
  - Found it.

- que:
  - He was actually there? You saw him?
  ans:
  - Well, what was left of him.

- que:
  - And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
  ans:
  - Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.

- que:
  - Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
  ans:
  - They want my diary.

- que:
  - You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you?
  ans:
  - I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.

- que:
  - Don't worry. He won't.
  ans:
  - Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?

- que:
  - How did you she was a Nazi?
  ans:
  - And the chair.

- que:
  - What final challenge?
  ans:
  - Three devices of such lethal cunning.

- que:
  - Booby traps?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

- que:
  - But what are they? Can't you remember?
  ans:
  - I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.

- que:
  - Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
  ans:
  - Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.

- que:
  - What about Marcus?
  ans:
  - This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.

- que:
  - What did you get?
  ans:
  - I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.

- que:
  - Hmmm... What did we talk about?
  ans:
  - We didn't talk. We never talked.

- que:
  - And do I detect a rebuke?
  ans:
  - Actually, I was a wonderful father.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.

- que:
  - Dad, how can you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. We'll find out.

- que:
  - Now, who are all these people?
  ans:
  - Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.

- que:
  - Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
  ans:
  - Dad?

- que:
  - What did you find, Dad?
  ans:
  - Me?... Illumination.

- que:
  - What did you find, Junior?
  ans:
  - Junior?! Dad...

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Ready.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.

- que:
  - I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
  ans:
  - They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.

- que:
  - Why are you trying to kill us?
  ans:
  - Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.

- que:
  - My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - My soul is prepared. How's yours?
  ans:
  - This is your last chance.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - My name is Kazim.

- que:
  - Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
  ans:
  - I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.

- que:
  - Interested in local curios?
  ans:
  - No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.

- que:
  - I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors. What was it they claimed was stolen?
  ans:
  - Something magical. A sacred rock.

- que:
  - Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
  ans:
  - Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people are...

- que:
  - Miss Scott panicked?
  ans:
  - Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.

- que:
  - Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
  ans:
  - It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.

- que:
  - Hard to believe, isn't it...?
  ans:
  - The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.

- que:
  - Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
  ans:
  - His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

- que:
  - Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
  ans:
  - We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.

- que:
  - A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
  ans:
  - I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.

- que:
  - Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
  ans:
  - You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.

- que:
  - And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
  ans:
  - That was a misunderstanding.

- que:
  - Lao She.
  ans:
  - You understand what he tells us?

- que:
  - Nee chin lie how ma?
  ans:
  - You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.

- que:
  - So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
  ans:
  - Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Okay, Shorty.

- que:
  - Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
  ans:
  - It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.

- que:
  - I ride with you, Indy?
  ans:
  - Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.

- que:
  - What you look at, Indy?
  ans:
  - Just a statue.

- que:
  - Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
  ans:
  - What does it mean, Indy?

- que:
  - Why they glow like that?
  ans:
  - Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.

- que:
  - You will go to palace there.
  ans:
  - That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?

- que:
  - Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
  ans:
  - No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.

- que:
  - I don't understand. What's happened here?
  ans:
  - The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.

- que:
  - What evil?
  ans:
  - They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.

- que:
  - But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
  ans:
  - Siam.

- que:
  - Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
  ans:
  - I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.

- que:
  - No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead. Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
  ans:
  - He told me they knew I was coming here.

- que:
  - What do you mean -- how?
  ans:
  - The old man saw it in a dream.

- que:
  - Took what?
  ans:
  - It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.

- que:
  - What'd he say now?
  ans:
  - It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...

- que:
  - Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
  ans:
  - I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.

- que:
  - What about the future?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.

- que:
  - Oh really?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory...

- que:
  - Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
  ans:
  - Maybe...

- que:
  - What does the writing say?
  ans:
  - It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

- que:
  - That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
  ans:
  - Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.

- que:
  - You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
  ans:
  - I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety.

- que:
  - Couldn't keep away, huh?
  ans:
  - Just try and control yourself.

- que:
  - Any more complaints?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...

- que:
  - Not leftovers?
  ans:
  - No -- real food.

- que:
  - Primitive sexual practices?
  ans:
  - You're talking to an authority in that area.

- que:
  - Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
  ans:
  - I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...

- que:
  - Dr. Jones?
  ans:
  - I'm going down.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You've got to go to sleep now.

- que:
  - Indy? Did you talk to them?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I'm going to puke in it...

- que:
  - Who's you?
  ans:
  - You're not gonna believe this...

- que:
  - Who was it?
  ans:
  - Me.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Al.

- que:
  - This candid camera?
  ans:
  - You're in my head...

- que:
  - You're in my head? You don't know my name?
  ans:
  - I just got here.

- que:
  - What? You lose your lease on a condo?
  ans:
  - Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.

- que:
  - Why don't we go home?
  ans:
  - Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.

- que:
  - Somebody's been here.
  ans:
  - Yeah?

- que:
  - My place, can't you see?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Quit screwing around, this is important.
  ans:
  - Who are you?

- que:
  - It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
  ans:
  - I told you, my name is Al.

- que:
  - What are you doing in my head, Al?
  ans:
  - You've heard of the PEM114...

- que:
  - Are you threatening me?
  ans:
  - I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.

- que:
  - No.
  ans:
  - Me? What'd I do?

- que:
  - You've heard of U.S.T.?
  ans:
  - I just went there for a job.

- que:
  - Then how'd I get here?
  ans:
  - I know...it sounds insane.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Loading a gun.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - Kill myself.

- que:
  - Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why he's argumentative?
  ans:
  - Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.

- que:
  - Why don't you?
  ans:
  - No they won't.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'll talk to them.

- que:
  - If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
  ans:
  - If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.

- que:
  - Anyone there?
  ans:
  - No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.

- que:
  - Behind us?
  ans:
  - Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.

- que:
  - What'd he look like?
  ans:
  - He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.

- que:
  - What do I do?
  ans:
  - Whatever you do, just...don't stop.

- que:
  - Then what are you stopping for?
  ans:
  - Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.

- que:
  - You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
  ans:
  - Calm Down! Act rational.

- que:
  - How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
  ans:
  - I don't know...To get Al.

- que:
  - It can't take that long.
  ans:
  - Did you hear that?

- que:
  - JOE Or what?
  ans:
  - I am. You are.

- que:
  - Find You?
  ans:
  - I'm not gonna make it easy.

- que:
  - Which way do I go?
  ans:
  - What does it say.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - A lab and equipment.

- que:
  - Who did?
  ans:
  - The man.

- que:
  - Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
  ans:
  - I can't remember..

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Black suits and helmets.

- que:
  - Gone where?
  ans:
  - Don't know.

- que:
  - You need ID in there?
  ans:
  - You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.

- que:
  - Just scratched my arm, why?
  ans:
  - I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.

- que:

  - Promise you what?
  ans:
  - That you're not crazy.

  - I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
  ans:
  - You talk to yourself.

  - That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
  ans:
  - Chiang Cho?

- que:
  - You've been there?
  ans:
  - I know the territory.

- que:
  - You coming along?
  ans:
  - So do I.

- que:
  - This going to work?
  ans:
  - Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I can't fly it.

- que:
  - Are you alright?
  ans:
  - Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.

- que:
  - Looks like they can. What did they do?
  ans:
  - They asked about you.

- que:
  - What did you tell them?
  ans:
  - That I really don't know.

  ans:
  - For you.

  - Now what?
  ans:
  - I've never met anyone like you.

  - Why not, what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Escape.

- que:
  - Just like that?
  ans:
  - I'll come back for you.

- que:
  - Kiss her you fool.
  ans:
  - Aren't you a little optimistic?

- que:
  - Who are you? Who do you work for?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - We just don't stop.

- que:
  - Riuji?
  ans:
  - I told you, I work for him.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - We're not moving fast enough for him.

- que:
  - What could you find in this place?
  ans:
  - ...Piece of mind.

- que:
  - Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
  ans:
  - I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.

- que:
  - Why'd you invite me here?
  ans:
  - Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.

- que:
  - Is there anything else?
  ans:
  - A drink...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You can't take that.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - The experiment. The danger...

- que:
  - Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on \"60 Minutes\"?

- que:
  - So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
  ans:
  - That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.

- que:
  - 2 Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm afraid I did.

- que:
  - You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
  ans:
  - 2 If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

  - I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the \"F\" up, they were going to kill you...

- que:
  - ...taping? What are you taping?
  ans:
  - I'm doing an interview.

- que:
  - Where should I wash them?
  ans:
  - Use the bathroom.

- que:
  - Can we talk about this when I get back?
  ans:
  - Yes... Jeffrey.

- que:
  - Did you say Berman?
  ans:
  - No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with \"60 Minutes\"...

- que:
  - \"60 Minutes\"?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - \"60 Minutes,\" the television show?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Will independent sources corroborate that?
  ans:
  - Hello? Yeah...

- que:
  - ...it's anonymous. References to \"P.M.\" It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
  ans:
  - I have to take a shower.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - They're killing the Wigand interview...

- que:
  - What are you and Mike going to do?
  ans:
  - Oh, my God.

- que:
  - Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
  ans:
  - Alright.

- que:
  - ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
  ans:
  - That's right...

- que:
  - Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
  ans:
  - It would be better if he called us.

- que:
  - Alright?
  ans:
  - Okay. Thank you.

- que:
  - What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
  ans:
  - ...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...

- que:
  - You eating with us?
  ans:
  - Well, it isn't \"cigarettes are bad for you\"...

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...

- que:
  - We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were \"compelled\"?
  ans:
  - Oh, torture? Great ratings.

- que:
  - How are the rooms? Comfortable?
  ans:
  - Thank you for saying that...

- que:
  - Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
  ans:
  - It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

- que:
  - After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. Anything else?
  ans:
  - I discovered this. SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm with Don on this.

- que:
  - I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Alright. What did you think?
  ans:
  - I think it was a disgrace.

- que:
  - Did I get you up?
  ans:
  - No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.

- que:
  - How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
  ans:
  - Oh, lots.

- que:
  - Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
  ans:
  - Mike... in my...

- que:
  - That Canada story? Still interest you?
  ans:
  - Everything interests me.

- que:
  - Coffee?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Thank you.

- que:
  - How have you liked your stay?
  ans:
  - What I've seen... I've liked.

- que:
  - Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
  ans:
  - Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - That's room service. They usually knock first. Come on in... Over here, please.

- que:
  - How do you like your coffee? Black?
  ans:
  - Black, black...

- que:
  - Like what? Your sign?
  ans:
  - I know what I have to know.

- que:
  - How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
  ans:
  - ...but that's as far as I go...

- que:
  - Far as you go where?
  ans:
  - This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.

- que:
  - Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work?
  ans:
  - Did work.

- que:
  - How much would I get paid?
  ans:
  - That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.

- que:
  - Should I just take the documents now?
  ans:
  - Jump in, quick, c'mon...

- que:
  - I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
  ans:
  - To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.

- que:
  - They're afraid of you, aren't they?
  ans:
  - They should be.

- que:
  - Seven dwarfs?
  ans:
  - The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...

- que:
  - No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.

- que:
  - It's okay.
  ans:
  - Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?

- que:
  - What did you get us?
  ans:
  - Tempura...

- que:
  - The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
  ans:
  - Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.

- que:
  - You charge by the hour?
  ans:
  - My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.

- que:
  - ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - You believe that?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You believe that?
  ans:
  - I believe that? Yes, I believe that.

- que:
  - You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Liane, this is a preliminary... You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
  ans:
  - ...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...

- que:
  - Did you have a good day?
  ans:
  - You attract a crowd.

- que:
  - You mean... since this morning?
  ans:
  - No. I mean since whenever...

- que:
  - ...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
  ans:
  - Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?

- que:
  - ABC...?
  ans:
  - ABC Telemarketing Company.

- que:
  - What does this have to do with my testimony?
  ans:
  - I fought for you... and I still fight for you.

- que:
  - Where are you, anyway?
  ans:
  - I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.

- que:
  - Did he hear you?
  ans:
  - MANAGER'S VOICE You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

- que:
  - Just give me an example...
  ans:
  - What about now?

- que:
  - We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How's Liane?
  ans:
  - She's okay.

- que:
  - What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
  ans:
  - I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - There is -- there is no family.

- que:
  - What do you mean there is no family?
  ans:
  - Liane has filed for divorce...

- que:
  - Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
  ans:
  - Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.

- que:
  - You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
  ans:
  - ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.

- que:
  - And that's what cigarettes are for...?
  ans:
  - A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...

- que:
  - And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
  ans:
  - In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...

- que:
  - And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
  ans:
  - Poor communication skills.

- que:
  - And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Jail?
  ans:
  - Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...

- que:
  - Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
  ans:
  - Seven...

- que:
  - You threatening my family, now, too?
  ans:
  - Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.

- que:
  - Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
  ans:
  - Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.

- que:
  - Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
  ans:
  - Here. Got pictures.

- que:
  - Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
  ans:
  - After you, Doll.

- que:
  - So she's uh, flourishing?
  ans:
  - She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.

- que:
  - Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
  ans:
  - I... uh guess congratulations are in order.

- que:
  - What part?
  ans:
  - I'd just like to have a word with her.

- que:
  - Is that... one person?
  ans:
  - Here's her picture...

- que:
  - Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
  ans:
  - Uh... poetry recitation.

- que:
  - Mr. Massey?
  ans:
  - Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.

- que:
  - What the hell is Botox?
  ans:
  - It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...

- que:
  - No frown lines. New watch?
  ans:
  - It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.

- que:
  - Got any symptoms?
  ans:
  - Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.

- que:
  - Is she Asian?
  ans:
  - Asian? No.

- que:
  - No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
  ans:
  - No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That was Marvin Untermeyer.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.

- que:
  - I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
  ans:
  - Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.

- que:
  - Marylin! What have I done?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.

- que:
  - Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
  ans:
  - I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.

- que:
  - What is your husband's profession?
  ans:
  - He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.

- que:
  - So who'd you hire?
  ans:
  - Ruth Rabino.

- que:
  - Why do you think she did it?
  ans:
  - Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.

- que:
  - It's about time.
  ans:
  - Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?

- que:
  - You said 'yes' didn't you?
  ans:
  - I said yes.

- que:
  - How nice.
  ans:
  - Is Tong older than Ming?

- que:
  - Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
  ans:
  - These are yours.

- que:
  - Isn't everything?
  ans:
  - Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.

- que:
  - Did you see the tape?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - What does your lawyer think?
  ans:
  - Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.

- que:
  - Why would you be here?
  ans:
  - I told you. I was hungry.

- que:
  - Have you ever been married, Miles?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No. I haven't. Have you?
  ans:
  - He wants a reconciliation.

- que:
  - What is it you're after, Miles?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.

- que:
  - Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
  ans:
  - He'll regret this.

- que:
  - Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
  ans:
  - Oh, for the love of...

- que:
  - That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
  ans:
  - That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.

- que:
  - -- we are both sure that's what we want?
  ans:
  - Absolutely.

- que:
  - But why him?
  ans:
  - We told you. We realized we've always been in love.

- que:
  - So I hear. Is that all?
  ans:
  - No, that's not all.

- que:
  - Have you tried the duck?
  ans:
  - I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.

- que:
  - Yes? Marylin?
  ans:
  - You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.

- que:
  - I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
  ans:
  - I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.

- que:
  - You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
  ans:
  - Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.

- que:
  - No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
  ans:
  - Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.

- que:
  - Is that you?
  ans:
  - Me. Yes.

- que:
  - Oh. And that is -- mom?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.

- que:
  - She held that against you?
  ans:
  - Apparently she was very disappointed.

- que:
  - Friends?
  ans:
  - Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

- que:
  - What is it Miles?
  ans:
  - I want... I want to...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.

- que:
  - Did you just propose to me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
  ans:
  - Yes, Miles. I accept.

- que:
  - Do you want me to sleep on it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
  ans:
  - Yes. Again.

- que:
  - Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
  ans:
  - Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.

- que:
  - But?
  ans:
  - Fabric and fringe.

- que:
  - You don't like me?
  ans:
  - I love you. I want to have your baby.

- que:
  - What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
  ans:
  - Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.

- que:
  - Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just... SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
  ans:
  - I want to nail you ass.

- que:
  - Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
  ans:
  - You can't prove anything.

- que:
  - Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.

- que:
  - Marylin?
  ans:
  - It's a no go, Joe.

- que:
  - Wait! He works for YOU?
  ans:
  - Now. But first, he worked for you.

- que:
  - You were going to have this thug...?
  ans:
  - Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.

- que:
  - Rex. Get away from the door.
  ans:
  - Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?

- que:
  - Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
  ans:
  - We are. And it's winding down.

- que:
  - Marylin?
  ans:
  - Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.

- que:
  - Dogs?
  ans:
  - Hello, Rex.

- que:
  - Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
  ans:
  - Sometimes I forget.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. Where were we?
  ans:
  - We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Jesus.

- que:
  - Forgery and Fraud?
  ans:
  - You used his credit card.

- que:
  - Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
  ans:
  - Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.

- que:
  - You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I didn't know Barry had a beach house.

- que:
  - Do you know him?
  ans:
  - By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.

- que:
  - Who's she?
  ans:
  - Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.

- que:
  - Well what does he want?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.

- que:
  - So where are you now?
  ans:
  - Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.

- que:
  - Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
  ans:
  - You're not...

- que:
  - Is this Ming?
  ans:
  - It's not Ming. It's Tong.

- que:
  - What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.

- que:
  - But you're going through with it?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.

- que:
  - So what?
  ans:
  - Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.

- que:
  - Herb wants to see me?
  ans:
  - When you have a moment.

- que:
  - So, Ruth. How's Sam?
  ans:
  - Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.

- que:
  - -- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
  ans:
  - My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.

- que:
  - Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
  ans:
  - Oh brother. Here we go.

- que:
  - Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
  ans:
  - Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.

- que:
  - Are you familiar with Kirshner?
  ans:
  - Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.

- que:
  - Did Marylin end up with money?
  ans:
  - She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.

- que:
  - Where does that leave us?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I can assume...

- que:
  - Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
  ans:
  - Video.

- que:
  - Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
  ans:
  - That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.

- que:
  - Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
  ans:
  - I think that went as well as could be expected.

- que:
  - Wait... He wants to give her...?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - And she has...?
  ans:
  - Video.

- que:
  - I am very sorry.
  ans:
  - What the fuck...?

- que:
  - Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
  ans:
  - No. You're not.

- que:
  - What the hell is wrong with you?
  ans:
  - I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - Berry spoons.

- que:
  - Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
  ans:
  - She could buy and sell you ten times over.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - She owes me a meal.

- que:
  - Wrigley?
  ans:
  - Miles.

- que:
  - Do you have it?
  ans:
  - I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.

- que:
  - Extinguish?
  ans:
  - Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.

- que:
  - Mother?
  ans:
  - Hi, Sweetie.

- que:
  - You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
  ans:
  - No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.

- que:
  - Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
  ans:
  - Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.

- que:
  - Three is not Farrow.
  ans:
  - I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

- que:
  - Who's Rex's guy?
  ans:
  - George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.

- que:
  - Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
  ans:
  - We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.

- que:
  - It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
  ans:
  - Whyuhshe's all right, sir.

- que:
  - Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami for the love of it?
  ans:
  - Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.

- que:
  - And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
  ans:
  - The reward.

- que:
  - Here you are. Do you mind if I ask you something frankly? Do you love my daughter?
  ans:
  - A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.

- que:
  - I asked you a question. Do you love her?
  ans:
  - Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.

- que:
  - What's this about not eating?
  ans:
  - I don't want to eat! And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.

- que:
  - Why don't you put me in chains?
  ans:
  - I might.

- que:
  - Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not. Yes?
  ans:
  - Smart, aren't you! So subtle.

- que:
  - Where are you taking me?
  ans:
  - Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.

- que:
  - That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
  ans:
  - You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.

- que:
  - Stunt?
  ans:
  - Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.

- que:
  - What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?

  ans:
  - Yes.

  - I hated to wake you up. How about some breakfast?
  ans:
  - No, thank you. Thank you so much.

- que:
  - Seems to me I've already thanked you for that. What time is the next bus to New York?
  ans:
  - What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.

- que:
  - My ticket?
  ans:
  - I found it on the seat.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.

  ans:
  - That's none of your business.

- que:
  - Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.

- que:
  - You've got a name, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.

- que:
  - Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
  ans:
  - Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Like this. I have no robe.

- que:
  - Where is the shower?
  ans:
  - Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.

- que:
  - Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
  ans:
  - Hurry up and get dressed.

- que:
  - Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
  ans:
  - If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.

- que:
  - Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
  ans:
  - Nope. No complaints.

- que:
  - What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
  ans:
  - Must be the Spring.

- que:
  - Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
  ans:
  - It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.

- que:
  - Santa Claus?
  ans:
  - KingKing Westley was in it.

- que:
  - Oh. Is that how you met him?
  ans:
  - Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.

- que:
  - Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
  ans:
  - Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.

- que:
  - Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
  ans:
  - There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?

- que:
  - Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
  ans:
  - You weren't so bad yourself.

- que:
  - How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
  ans:
  - No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.

- que:
  - I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - I don't trust that chatterbox.

- que:
  - What do you meanstarvation?
  ans:
  - It takes money to buy food.

- que:
  - Why, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.

- que:
  - I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
  ans:
  - Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.

- que:
  - To New York?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Aren't you afraid of me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
  ans:
  - If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.

- que:
  - What's got into you?
  ans:
  - Oh, Peter! I was so scared.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Nothing you'd give two cents for.

- que:
  - What are you thinking about?
  ans:
  - By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.

- que:
  - What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
  ans:
  - No. But I've got a penknife.

- que:
  - Needn't rub it in. What're you eating?
  ans:
  - Carrots.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. Want one?
  ans:
  - No!! It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.

- que:
  - What if nobody stops for us?
  ans:
  - Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.

- que:
  - Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
  ans:
  - Amazing.

- que:
  - Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
  ans:
  - You! Don't make me laugh.

- que:
  - What're you going to do?
  ans:
  - Mind your own business.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.

- que:
  - Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.

- que:
  - What about money?
  ans:
  - Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.

- que:
  - Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, swell.

- que:
  - Thank you. Am I going to see you in New York?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.

- que:
  - I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Goodnight, Mr. Warne.

- que:
  - Whome? Want to see me?
  ans:
  - No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.

- que:
  - Do you know?
  ans:
  - You sound like a hobo.

- que:
  - Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
  ans:
  - Yep! The Walls of Jericho.

- que:
  - How are you, Ellie? Are you happy?
  ans:
  - You bet we did.

- que:
  - Where's the bus to New York?
  ans:
  - Left twenty minutes ago.

- que:
  - When does the bus leave?
  ans:
  - Yesif he is your husband.

- que:
  - Isn't he here?
  ans:
  - No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I've been thinking about you.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Eight o'clock.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Bridge washed outaround Dawson.

- que:
  - Up yonder. See the lights?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You mean about the Andrews' kid?
  ans:
  - That's it. I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.

- que:
  - What's the thousand bucks for?
  ans:
  - To tear down the Walls of Jericho.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - That she's going to marry somebody else.

- que:
  - Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
  ans:
  - If it's on the level.

- que:
  - Who's she gonna marry?
  ans:
  - It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.

- que:
  - Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.

- que:
  - Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
  ans:
  - Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.

- que:
  - Yeah, where am I?
  ans:
  - When you sober upcome in and see me.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I ain't got a hat.

- que:
  - Funny couple, ain't they?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What do you reckon that's for?
  ans:
  - Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.

- que:
  - A trumpet?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.

- que:
  - But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
  ans:
  - I dunno.

- que:
  - You send telegrams here?
  ans:
  - Go on. Go on send the telegram.

- que:
  - Collect?
  ans:
  - There's a seat over there for you.

- que:
  - What's the idea?
  ans:
  - I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind.

- que:
  - Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
  ans:
  - Wife?

  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'd go fifty-fifty with you .

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball, is what I always say.

- que:
  - What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - Five G'sor I crab the works.

- que:
  - Yeahthe \"big boy\"the Boss of the outfit.
  ans:

  ans:
  - Yeah. Just babies.

- que:
  - SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
  ans:
  - You love them, don't you?

- que:
  - If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business. Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
  ans:
  - When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.

- que:
  - When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
  ans:
  - Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.

- que:
  - What was his voice like?
  ans:
  - You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know. He had command of the king's English.

- que:
  - Did he pay?
  ans:
  - Always - like tits on a pig. I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.

- que:
  - And Oswald?
  ans:
  - Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...

- que:
  - So you saw Oswald how many times?
  ans:
  - Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...

- que:
  - Recall any names?
  ans:
  - Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes. Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.

- que:
  - Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean? Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
  ans:
  - There were no phone records.

- que:
  - Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right? I said Oswald must've flipped. Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
  ans:
  - I think I'll cut out here, chief. I gotta get home.

- que:
  - Who the hell opened my files! You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
  ans:
  - You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid. I mean, you really are.

- que:
  - I always lock my files. And you were the only one here today... What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
  ans:
  - You know what I mean. I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer. And a lotta strange people.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...

- que:
  - Or a cover up! Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
  ans:
  - Bill.

- que:
  - Correct me if I'm wrong. I thought we were on the same side. What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
  ans:
  - Pretty fast, wasn't it. The way they let him go.

- que:
  - What do you think, Lou?
  ans:
  - I'm just an investigator, Bill. I leave the theories to you lawyers.

- que:
  - You know you keep saying that.
  ans:
  - You, Numa?

- que:
  - Keep saying what?
  ans:
  - You're not digging.

- que:
  - What's the other name?
  ans:
  - Shaw. Clay Shaw.

- que:
  - Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw? The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
  ans:
  - Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.

- que:
  - Clay Bertrand, Willie?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Clay. I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.

- que:
  - Did he pay you for this?
  ans:
  - Twenty dollars each time. Hell, it's no secret. That's what I'm here for.

- que:
  - And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
  ans:
  - Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him as...

- que:
  - Hold your horses. What kinda source?
  ans:
  - The anonymous kind, Chief.

- que:
  - Morning, boys. Ready for a walking tour?
  ans:
  - At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.

- que:
  - What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
  ans:
  - Lord, wake me, please. I must be dreaming.

- que:
  - I'm lost, boss. What are we saying here?
  ans:
  - He had his palm print on the weapon.

- que:
  - But why?
  ans:
  - To frame him, obviously. You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill! They're not ordinary crooks.

- que:
  - Can you get some sworn statements?
  ans:
  - That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.

- que:
  - All right, all right. Break it up.
  ans:
  - Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?

- que:
  - Where you going, boss?
  ans:
  - I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.

- que:
  - With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up? Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's it look like, Nick?
  ans:
  - I don't see any violence, Jim. Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. Looks like natural causes.

- que:
  - Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
  ans:
  - He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

- que:
  - Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
  ans:
  - If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.

- que:
  - I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
  ans:
  - Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...

- que:
  - ...Oswald?
  ans:
  - No, I did not.

- que:
  - ...ever called Dean Andrews?
  ans:
  - No, I did not.

- que:
  - ...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
  ans:
  - No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.

- que:
  - ...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
  ans:
  - No, I did not.

- que:
  - Calm down, Dave, what?
  ans:
  - I'm a dead man! From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.

- que:
  - You still questioning any Cubans?
  ans:
  - Dave, you know that's where this road leads.

- que:
  - ...give me protection?
  ans:
  - Yeah! He'd kill for you Dave. He likes you. Your mind.

- que:
  - Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
  ans:
  - That cocksuckin' faggot! He's got me by the balls.

- que:
  - Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
  ans:
  - That's not true. I never met anybody named Oswald. Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.

- que:
  - I'm sure you've seen this. Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
  ans:
  - No, I never saw him before in my life.

- que:
  - What was so appealing about Houston?
  ans:
  - I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.

- que:
  - I see. And where did you drive?
  ans:
  - We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.

- que:
  - Why Galveston?
  ans:
  - No particular reason. Just to go somewhere.

- que:
  - And then Sunday?
  ans:
  - In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.

- que:
  - Did you bag any geese on this trip?
  ans:
  - I believe the boys got a couple.

- que:
  - Why? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

- que:
  - Same one. I didn't know no impersonator.
  ans:
  - Let me get this straight, now. Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?

- que:
  - And Shaw?
  ans:
  - Shaw's an \"untouchable\", man - highest clearance. Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.

- que:
  - Then who killed the President?
  ans:
  - Dave, it's going to be okay. Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you. I guarantee it.

- que:
  - Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
  ans:
  - I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.

- que:
  - As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
  ans:
  - I had the cause of death.

- que:
  - But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I call'em as I see'em, Jim. I'm ruling it inadmissible.

- que:
  - Daddy! Where have you been?
  ans:
  - Hi, Freckle Face.

- que:
  - Are we going away, Daddy?
  ans:
  - Well, it looks like it, Jasper.

- que:
  - Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
  ans:
  - No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.

- que:
  - Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
  ans:
  - I want the truth.

- que:
  - How many shots you say you heard?
  ans:
  - Four to six.

- que:
  - Don't get sidetracked! How does he get back to the States? That's the point. Does he have any problems?
  ans:
  - This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific! He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!

- que:
  - But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
  ans:
  - Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.

- que:
  - And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out?
  ans:
  - Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.

- que:
  - No, I don't think I am, Susie. Anyone else?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you. Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
  ans:
  - No. Never heard of him.

- que:
  - A Perry Russo?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - A Willie O'Keefe?
  ans:
  - No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - David Ferrie.

- que:
  - No, it was not. Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
  ans:
  - One meets so many attorneys in my business. No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.

- que:
  - Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
  ans:
  - You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.

- que:
  - And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
  ans:
  - No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.

- que:
  - Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim? Jim, dinner.
  ans:
  - You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?

- que:
  - Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold. What are you doing in here?
  ans:
  - I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.

- que:
  - These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison. I wish you'd stop readin' them.
  ans:
  - Honey, you all right?

- que:
  - Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday. You were there, why didn't you say something?
  ans:
  - Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake. You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

- que:
  - Did they live?
  ans:
  - It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.

- que:
  - I'm leaving. I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving! I won't stand it anymore.
  ans:
  - Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?

- que:
  - You and your government! What's the matter with you? Don't you have any feelings? Your daughter! What kind of man are you?
  ans:
  - I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

- que:
  - I never doubted for a second that I was. Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
  ans:
  - I don't think so, Jim...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy. They shot him down.

- que:
  - For sexual purposes?
  ans:
  - Well... yeah.

- que:
  - Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal? Under the supervision of a doctor?
  ans:
  - Fuck, yeah! I told you so. And you can tell'em all I told you so.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Lou?
  ans:
  - Boss, the President's been shot. In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

- que:
  - Oh no!... How bad?
  ans:
  - No word yet. But they think it's in the head.

- que:
  - Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be running that training?
  ans:
  - The Office of Naval Intelligence.

- que:
  - What are you driving at, boss?
  ans:
  - They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go. No record of them ever being questioned.

- que:
  - ...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
  ans:
  - Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.

- que:
  - Can we find her?
  ans:
  - I'd say the opposite - hypertension.

- que:
  - Time?
  ans:
  - Between six and seven seconds.

- que:
  - Didn't Hoover say something about that? The leaves had fallen off in November?
  ans:
  - The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou. We gotta get our hands on it.

- que:
  - Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston? There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
  ans:
  - When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.

- que:
  - You know who the mayor was?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - The Warren Commission call him?
  ans:
  - His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.

- que:
  - Allen Dulles?
  ans:
  - They're gonna love you, chief.

- que:
  - Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
  ans:
  - Well, if that's what you want to call it. I didn't ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.

- que:
  - I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
  ans:
  - You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.

- que:
  - You think there were other men involved, Russell?
  ans:
  - I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry. Call me whatever you like.

- que:
  - Are they? Why would they?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I don't... I can't believe it. They killed him because he wanted to change things. In our time - in our country?
  ans:
  - Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me. Don't trust me. Do your own work, your own thinking.

- que:
  - The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
  ans:
  - I haven't yet. I don't have much of a case.

- que:
  - His name?
  ans:
  - ...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.

- que:
  - Here's my problem, Jack. You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
  ans:
  - More than ten years.

- que:
  - And he never hit you before?
  ans:
  - Never touched me.

- que:
  - How much more?
  ans:
  - I don't know if I should talk about this.

- que:
  - Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - If you buy what you read in the paper.

- que:
  - You have other information?
  ans:
  - I didn't say that. All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.

- que:
  - Where is Banister in all this?
  ans:
  - Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.

- que:
  - And Oswald?
  ans:
  - Anything more specific, Jack? It's important.

- que:
  - Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
  ans:
  - Clay something, that was his name - Clay.

- que:
  - Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
  ans:
  - Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.

- que:
  - Clay Bertrand. He's in the Warren Report. He tried to get Oswald a lawyer. Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
  ans:
  - Sure. 'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...

- que:
  - The assassination, Jack?
  ans:
  - Never. Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go. I said enough. I said all I'm going to say.

- que:
  - Hold on, Jack. What's the problem?
  ans:
  - What's the problem? What's the problem? Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison? I better go.

- que:
  - Even my own wife, chief, Who's wondering where I am?
  ans:
  - Hate mail here. Fan mail here. The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.

- que:
  - Welcome, Mr. Miller. Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
  ans:
  - Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison. Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.

- que:
  - Where were you? Europe, Pacific?
  ans:
  - Germany.

- que:
  - I know about that shot. A terrible tragedy. How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
  ans:
  - If you must know, virtually nothing.

- que:
  - How many men are working with you on this?
  ans:
  - Less than you would guess. Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.

- que:
  - That's all you've had all this time?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - Virginia or Elizabeth?
  ans:
  - Virginia.

- que:
  - Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest. Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
  ans:
  - That sounds fun.

- que:
  - I need some information from you then. How old are you?
  ans:
  - Six.

- que:
  - And you get of from school at 3 every day?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you walk home?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - When are you going back to Washington, sir?
  ans:
  - I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.

- que:
  - I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
  ans:
  - Not a problem.

- que:
  - So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I'll call her.

- que:
  - Won't forget?
  ans:
  - I won't forget.

- que:
  - Who was there for your ass?
  ans:
  - You were there for me.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - How old is that machine gun shit?
  ans:
  - That's not what they're tellin' me.

- que:
  - That's why they call it \"fuckin' with ya.\" Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
  ans:
  - Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I need a favor.

- que:
  - That requires me goin' out tonight?
  ans:
  - A bit.

- que:
  - Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
  ans:
  - Go ahead.

- que:
  - Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
  ans:
  - You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.

- que:
  - Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
  ans:
  - Course you didn't.

- que:
  - Does he have the marked bills on him?
  ans:
  - In his inside coat pocket.

- que:
  - Why were you with him?
  ans:
  - I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.

- que:
  - How'd you know where he was?
  ans:
  - I found out.

- que:
  - And you didn't tell the Police?
  ans:
  - I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.

- que:
  - I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
  ans:
  - That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.

- que:
  - Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
  ans:
  - Great, you're here.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - She wants to make a deal.

- que:
  - She sound scared?
  ans:
  - She almost sounds scared.

- que:
  - What's she want?
  ans:
  - She wants to go back to work.

- que:
  - What's she willing to give us?
  ans:
  - She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.

- que:
  - She knows it's my case?
  ans:
  - She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.

- que:
  - Can I have a word with you?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
  ans:
  - The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.

- que:
  - If I were to tell you \"no it isn't...\"
  ans:
  - I'm not saying another word.

- que:
  - While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
  ans:
  - My pocketbook.

- que:
  - What's in it?
  ans:
  - Beauty products.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - That's my diet shit.

- que:
  - Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
  ans:
  - Take your time.

- que:
  - Help us do what?
  ans:
  - Help you get Ordell Robbie.

- que:
  - How was your flight?
  ans:
  - Fine.

- que:
  - He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
  ans:
  - She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

- que:
  - I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Who do you think I am?
  ans:
  - I gave you my card there.

- que:
  - Who put up my bond? Ordell?
  ans:
  - In cash.

- que:
  - Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - I thought you might want a drink?
  ans:
  - I'd love one, but not there.

- que:
  - That doesn't sound dark.
  ans:
  - Is it dark?

- que:
  - Why does it need to be dark?
  ans:
  - Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.

- que:
  - You gain weight?
  ans:
  - Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.

- que:
  - Was she helpful?
  ans:
  - She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.

- que:
  - You're not tired of it?
  ans:
  - I am, as a matter of fact.

- que:
  - So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
  ans:
  - I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.

- que:
  - You know who put the dope in your bag?
  ans:
  - They wanted you to tell them what you know.

- que:
  - What did they want to know?
  ans:
  - That would be Beaumont Livingston.

- que:
  - That's him. How do you know 'em?
  ans:
  - I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.

- que:
  - Ordell pick up his bond?
  ans:
  - Same as you. Ten thousand.

- que:
  - No, you didn't. What branch?
  ans:
  - Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

- que:
  - How many trips did you make?
  ans:
  - With ten thousand? Nine.

- que:
  - If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
  ans:
  - Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.

- que:
  - What'dya think?
  ans:
  - I think maybe I have more options than I thought.

- que:
  - You get a chance to use it?
  ans:
  - I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.

- que:
  - What, I couldn't hear you?
  ans:
  - You went out this morning and bought a gun.

- que:
  - Somebody loan it to you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Want to hear some music?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You never got into the whole CD revolution?
  ans:
  - I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - The Delfonics.

- que:
  - 76?
  ans:
  - 74, I think.

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.

- que:
  - How'd you find that out?
  ans:
  - He told me last night.

- que:
  - He called you?
  ans:
  - He came by.

- que:
  - What?... What'd you do?
  ans:
  - We talked.

- que:
  - He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
  ans:
  - No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.

- que:
  - How do you get it out?
  ans:
  - Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.

- que:
  - You're gonna offer to set him up?
  ans:
  - If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.

- que:
  - How do you feel about getting old?
  ans:
  - You're not old. You look great.

- que:
  - I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
  ans:
  - It's not really something I think about.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.

- que:
  - How'd you feel about it?
  ans:
  - I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.

- que:
  - Bigger?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
  ans:
  - Fifteen thousand.

- que:
  - I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
  ans:
  - Catching a movie.

- que:
  - How was it?
  ans:
  - Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.

- que:
  - Oh, are you? Does she know that?
  ans:
  - No... ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.

- que:
  - And Annette's it for you?
  ans:
  - For now. These relationships never last too long.

- que:
  - Sandra Bullock. You know her?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in \"Speed.\" She's cute.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm old enough to be her father.

- que:
  - How old's Annette?
  ans:
  - I don't care.

- que:
  - What're you, a bag lady?
  ans:
  - I go back to work tomorrow.

- que:
  - You talk them into it?
  ans:
  - They seem to like the idea.

- que:
  - Bring the money in and they follow it?
  ans:
  - Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.

- que:
  - You don't actually do it that way?
  ans:
  - Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.

- que:
  - Will Ordell go for that?
  ans:
  - I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.

- que:
  - He was here?
  ans:
  - Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.

- que:
  - You think he's got a thing for you?
  ans:
  - Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.

- que:
  - I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
  ans:
  - He's setting me up to make a proposition.

- que:
  - Has he hinted around?
  ans:
  - You know some interesting people.

- que:
  - Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
  ans:
  - He tries to act cool.

- que:
  - What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
  ans:
  - No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.

- que:
  - If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
  ans:
  - You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.

- que:
  - When did you decide?
  ans:
  - It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.

- que:
  - The day you got me out of jail?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - What do you do when he comes home?
  ans:
  - Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.

- que:
  - You do that?
  ans:
  - That's my job.

- que:
  - And is that it?
  ans:
  - More or less.

- que:
  - If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
  ans:
  - I believe I said I'd be tempted.

- que:
  - What if I've figured a way?
  ans:
  - The feds. It's evidence.

- que:
  - Do you think they bought it?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.

- que:
  - Where's the rest of it?
  ans:
  - In the bag underneath.

- que:
  - What if he checks it?
  ans:
  - He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.

- que:
  - How'd you find out?
  ans:
  - All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.

- que:
  - How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
  ans:
  - He's liable to shoot you.

- que:
  - So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
  ans:
  - Get Ordell to come to your office.

- que:
  - Tell him you want to see him?
  ans:
  - Tell him I want to give him his money.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.

- que:
  - What do you tell Nicolet?
  ans:
  - Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.

- que:
  - We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
  ans:
  - He's already there.

- que:
  - Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
  ans:
  - I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.

- que:
  - Did you tell him you were leaving?
  ans:
  - I told him I might.

- que:
  - Do you blame yourself for helping me?
  ans:
  - I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.

- que:
  - Where're you going?
  ans:
  - Spain.

- que:
  - Wanna go?
  ans:
  - Thanks, but you have a good time.

- que:
  - Sure I can't twist your arm?
  ans:
  - Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.

- que:
  - I thought you were tired of your business?
  ans:
  - I'm just tired in general.

- que:
  - Are you scared of me?
  ans:
  - You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.

- que:
  - What if I plead guilty?
  ans:
  - And cooperate? You might get probation.

- que:
  - If I don't cooperate?
  ans:
  - He say we like the same thing as married.

- que:
  - Do you live together?
  ans:
  - Most of the times.

- que:
  - Not every day?
  ans:
  - Sometimes every day, for a while.

- que:
  - Then you don't see him for a few days?
  ans:
  - Yes'm.

- que:
  - You know what's in the bag you're taking?
  ans:
  - He say is a surprise.

- que:
  - What the fuck is that shit?
  ans:
  - I know what it looks like.

- que:
  - It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
  ans:
  - We'll just be a minute.

- que:
  - Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
  ans:
  - I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.

- que:
  - Oh, so now you know him?
  ans:
  - You never asked me if I did or not.

- que:
  - No shit. You know how he makes his money?
  ans:
  - He sells guns.

- que:
  - You ever see him sell guns?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm recording this.

- que:
  - You two meet?
  ans:
  - This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.

- que:
  - You talk to him?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
  ans:
  - I imagine shit needs to be done.

- que:
  - Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Who's the other one?
  ans:
  - White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

- que:
  - And splittin' with her?
  ans:
  - I'm sure that was the idea.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.

- que:
  - She told you that?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Was she there?
  ans:
  - She didn't say.

- que:
  - But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Right. Everything's the same, except one change...

- que:
  - Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
  ans:
  - We could, if I'm not in jail.

- que:
  - You didn't count it?
  ans:
  - I never have. It's not my money.

- que:
  - What? To put one of these in my pocket?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
  ans:
  - Yes. All those things are true.

- que:
  - After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
  ans:
  - That would be one point of view.

- que:
  - How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
  ans:
  - Si.

- que:
  - Where's the bag she gave you?
  ans:
  - You took the time to pay the saleswoman.

- que:
  - There was a guy with Melanie?
  ans:
  - Not in the fitting room.

- que:
  - It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
  ans:
  - I have no idea.

- que:
  - You'd take a polygraph on it?
  ans:
  - If it'll make you happy.

- que:
  - Do you think I took some of that money?
  ans:
  - Oh, hi.

- que:
  - Buy ya a beer?
  ans:
  - I'm waiting for the phone.

- que:
  - Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:

- que:
  - Where you gonna be during all this?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.

  - No.

- que:
  - Does that bother you?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Uh-huh?
  ans:
  - Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.

- que:
  - And your point is?
  ans:
  - Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...

- que:

  - Sure. We almost done, ain't we?

  ans:
  - Twice. In the parking lot.

  - What does she do for you?
  ans:
  - You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.

- que:

  ans:
  - Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.

- que:
  - Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
  ans:
  - Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said \"if\" -- it was just her shit to get high with.

  ans:
  - That's right. We did.

- que:
  - What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
  ans:
  - It's hard to explain.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? What's going on? How can you just turn away? What about the others?
  ans:
  - They're not interested, Jake.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Maybe there's a larger truth.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Maybe the demons are real.

- que:
  - Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
  ans:
  - Listen, Jake. I gotta go.

- que:
  - What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
  ans:
  - There was a bang.

  - Doctor. Ph.D.

- que:
  - Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
  ans:
  - I'm too messed up to teach.

- que:
  - Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
  ans:
  - Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.

- que:
  - Used you?
  ans:
  - I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.

- que:
  - What the hell is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.

- que:
  - I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
  ans:
  - Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.

- que:
  - Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.

- que:
  - What do you mean, demons?
  ans:

  ans:
  - A couple of weeks, I think.

  ans:
  - I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.

- que:
  - I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
  ans:
  - Louis, you're a life saver.

- que:
  - Am I dead, Louis? Am I dead?
  ans:
  - From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.

- que:
  - What? By myself?
  ans:
  - You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.

- que:
  - I'm walking, aren't I?
  ans:
  - Jake, you need to rest.

- que:
  - Are you in the service?
  ans:
  - The postal service. I'm a mailman.

- que:
  - And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
  ans:
  - I haven't seen her in months.

- que:
  - Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
  ans:
  - Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.

- que:
  - Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
  ans:
  - No. I see them.

- que:
  - See them? What do you mean? Physically?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
  ans:
  - I don't know what to say.

- que:
  - Hell, you think I am?
  ans:
  - I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.

- que:
  - Carlson? Is he new here?
  ans:
  - New? He's been here for years.

  - Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
  ans:
  - Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.

  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Jacob Singer.

- que:
  - Whataya mean, no record?
  ans:
  - You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.

  - It's freezing.

- que:
  - What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
  ans:
  - I don't want to know.

- que:
  - Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
  ans:

  ans:
  - I'm not dead. I am not dead.

- que:
  - My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
  ans:
  - Jacob, what can I do?

- que:
  - Your back? Did you fall?
  ans:
  - They stole it.

- que:
  - Who did?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.

- que:
  - We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
  ans:
  - I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.

- que:
  - Why didn't you turn on the light?
  ans:
  - I didn't want to wake you.

- que:
  - Where are you?
  ans:
  - If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.

- que:
  - That help?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
  ans:
  - What do you think?

- que:
  - It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
  ans:
  - Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.

- que:
  - What happened to you?
  ans:
  - Don't ask.

- que:
  - Where'd you leave 'em?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Did you look around the headboard?
  ans:
  - Jezzie, I can't see.

- que:
  - Thanks. What's that?
  ans:
  - Your kid dropped it off.

- que:
  - Who? Jed?
  ans:
  - No. The little one.

- que:
  - Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
  ans:
  - They're weird names.

- que:
  - And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
  ans:
  - I don't let anybody call me that.

- que:
  - You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
  ans:
  - You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.

- que:
  - Yeah, but for what?
  ans:
  - Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so \"what's his name\" brought 'em over on his way to school.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Why you left.

- que:
  - What do you mean you can see?
  ans:
  - Look at her face. A real bitch.

- que:
  - Is that the one who died?
  ans:
  - Gabe.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - I'm going home.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.

- que:
  - Why do you bring her up?
  ans:
  - Cause she's always on your mind.

- que:
  - When was the last time I said a word?
  ans:
  - It has nothin' to do with talkin'.

- que:
  - What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
  ans:
  - I wanna leave. Get me out of here.

- que:
  - Where are we?
  ans:
  - We're at Della's.

- que:
  - Hey, I'm here.
  ans:
  - Where?

- que:
  - Can't you stop it?
  ans:
  - If I could stop it, I'd stop it.

- que:
  - What's it say? A hundred and two?
  ans:
  - I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.

- que:
  - What does it say?
  ans:
  - It's gone to the top.

- que:
  - How high is that?
  ans:
  - The numbers stop at 107.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doin'?
  ans:
  - That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.

- que:
  - Coming here?
  ans:
  - Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.

- que:
  - What kind of man are you?
  ans:
  - Don't gimme that.

- que:
  - So tell me ... am I still an angel?
  ans:
  - With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.

- que:
  - He did? When?
  ans:
  - While you were in the shower.

- que:
  - Why didn't you call me?
  ans:
  - He didn't give me a chance. Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.

- que:
  - What? What do you mean?
  ans:
  - He said you didn't have one.

- que:
  - What's he talking about?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.

- que:
  - Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
  ans:
  - Stay away from me, Jez.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I have no idea. I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.

- que:
  - How do you know he's telling the truth?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.

- que:
  - Are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.

- que:
  - What's gotten into you?
  ans:
  - I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.

- que:
  - What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
  ans:
  - Sit down, Jake.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - Sit down.

- que:
  - No! What's going on? Where's my family?
  ans:
  - It's over, Jake. It's all over.

- que:
  - Where have they gone?
  ans:
  - Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.

- que:
  - YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
  ans:
  - What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?

- que:
  - So tell me ... am I still an angel?
  ans:
  - With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.

- que:
  - Why won't you answer me?
  ans:
  - Cause you know goddamn well who I am.

- que:
  - What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
  ans:
  - I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.

- que:
  - Jake, what is it?
  ans:
  - I'm tired.

- que:
  - Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
  ans:
  - Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.

- que:
  - Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
  ans:
  - You can have anything you want.

- que:
  - I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage. Where'd you go today?
  ans:
  - Mid-town mostly.

- que:
  - Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
  ans:
  - I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.

- que:
  - Oh? Where you going?
  ans:
  - West.

- que:
  - Where's West? New Jersey?
  ans:
  - Don't be funny.

- que:
  - Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
  ans:
  - Sit down, Jake.

- que:
  - No! What's going on? Where's my family?
  ans:
  - It's over, Jake. It's all over.

- que:
  - Where have they gone?
  ans:
  - Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.

- que:
  - Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
  ans:
  - WHO ARE YOU?

- que:
  - I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
  ans:
  - Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.

- que:
  - The Ladder?
  ans:
  - Like it was yesterday.

- que:
  - But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
  ans:
  - Yeah. But not with the Cong.

- que:
  - Who then?
  ans:
  - I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.

- que:
  - You come here often?
  ans:
  - Sometimes. When it's convenient.

- que:
  - How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
  ans:
  - Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.

- que:
  - Never?
  ans:
  - I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.

- que:
  - One drop?
  ans:
  - It's strong stuff.

- que:
  - Where's Wong?
  ans:
  - That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.

- que:
  - Hot. Where do I sign?
  ans:
  - You got a nice tan, though.

- que:
  - Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
  ans:
  - No. I'll take the other one. Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.

- que:
  - For what? For seeking the truth?
  ans:
  - Please come quietly.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - Lennox Hospital.

- que:
  - I'm awake?
  ans:
  - You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of this.

- que:
  - Of course it is. What else could it be?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Jacob Singer?
  ans:
  - A long time.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
  ans:
  - Nothin' much.

- que:
  - Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
  ans:
  - I need to see you, Jake.

- que:
  - You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
  ans:
  - Count 'em on one hand.

- que:
  - It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
  ans:
  - No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.

- que:
  - Still married, Jake?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Why the hell we drivin' here?
  ans:
  - I just need to talk.

- que:
  - You can't talk in Brownsville?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.

- que:
  - That black car?
  ans:
  - Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em.

- que:
  - What's goin' on Paul?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You in trouble?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Who is?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - They're waitin' for me, that's why.

- que:
  - You've seen them?
  ans:
  - Everywhere, like a plague.

- que:
  - The army?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I don't know.

- que:
  - What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.

- que:
  - I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
  ans:
  - I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.

- que:
  - Died?
  ans:
  - A car accident.

- que:
  - Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
  ans:
  - Last month, before Thanksgiving.

- que:
  - How did it happen?
  ans:
  - No one knows. They say it blew up.

- que:
  - Do you want me to get someone?
  ans:
  - No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.

- que:
  - Is he all right?
  ans:
  - He doesn't like it.

- que:
  - I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
  ans:
  - Pour it in.

- que:
  - On top of him?
  ans:
  - He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.

- que:
  - Punk?
  ans:
  - Pause play.

- que:
  - Duck fuckers?
  ans:
  - Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.

- que:
  - Can we blow it with just two?
  ans:
  - If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Nothing.

- que:
  - We made it?
  ans:
  - The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done.

- que:
  - Done?
  ans:
  - Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.

- que:
  - Bomb?
  ans:
  - Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

- que:
  - Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
  ans:
  - Rizzo did.

- que:
  - You see that?
  ans:
  - Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.

- que:
  - Everyone okay?
  ans:
  - I think I broke my arm.

- que:
  - What are you gonna do, tell me?
  ans:
  - I'll need system four converters.

- que:
  - Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
  ans:
  - We'd need charges.

- que:
  - Faster! Don't we have another gun?
  ans:
  - Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - My job.

- que:
  - Yllo, what's your head count?
  ans:
  - Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.

- que:
  - At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm with you kid.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Negative.

- que:
  - Give me a break! What happened?
  ans:
  - We have to get off this ship.

- que:
  - Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
  ans:
  - Rizzo, he's out there.

- que:
  - Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
  ans:
  - Guys!!! The shuttle?

- que:
  - Med-kit?
  ans:
  - It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

- que:
  - Were you close to your father?
  ans:
  - They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.

- que:
  - And what happend to ...?
  ans:
  - I couldn't save them.

- que:
  - Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
  ans:
  - See? We're not so bad.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - Wait around on your asses all day. I'll need a distraction.

- que:
  - Got it. You ever space walked?
  ans:
  - Oh sure, all the time.

- que:
  - You wanna release your air tanks?
  ans:
  - Okay, good tip.

- que:
  - Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
  ans:
  - I think I had some when I was eight.

- que:
  - I think so, why?
  ans:
  - No thank you, you crazy old woman.

- que:
  - Old woman?
  ans:
  - Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.

- que:
  - What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
  ans:
  - She needs a little time.

- que:
  - I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
  ans:
  - Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?

- que:
  - Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
  ans:
  - Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.

- que:
  - Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
  ans:
  - Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

- que:
  - And what's with the headgear?
  ans:
  - The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

- que:
  - Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
  ans:
  - I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

- que:
  - Small brains make your balls itch?
  ans:
  - YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.

- que:
  - Would you?
  ans:
  - You're so bossy.

- que:
  - You're leaving me here alone?
  ans:
  - You're quicker than usual.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.

- que:
  - Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
  ans:
  - Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.

- que:
  - I don't know...sorry?
  ans:
  - Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

- que:
  - Robot huh?
  ans:
  - Kay-em 14.

- que:
  - Are there any other shuttles?
  ans:
  - Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.

- que:
  - I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
  ans:
  - You killed him?

- que:
  - Am I in there?
  ans:
  - Sory...

- que:
  - Who are you apologizing to?
  ans:
  - Good point.

- que:
  - Do I have to?
  ans:
  - Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.

- que:
  - Kay-Em, you okay?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

- que:
  - Kay-em you okay?
  ans:
  - I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

- que:
  - I don't understand...what does he want?
  ans:
  - He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Ssh.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.

- que:
  - I'll reset our course ... 3 hours?
  ans:
  - See you then ... doctor.

- que:
  - How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
  ans:
  - Nanotechnology.

- que:
  - 30? How long was I out?
  ans:
  - Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...

- que:
  - But...I...400 years?
  ans:
  - That's right, now if you could...

- que:
  - Are you finished?
  ans:
  - Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

- que:
  - You're not going anywhere.
  ans:
  - Azrael can you repeat that?

- que:
  - What good will that do?
  ans:
  - They can deal with this sort of thing.

- que:
  - More soldiers?
  ans:
  - Scientists. Very intellegent men.

- que:
  - Three...two...one...
  ans:
  - How do you open the damn door?

- que:
  - The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
  ans:
  - What have I done?! Idiots.

- que:
  - So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
  ans:
  - Can we get through these?

- que:
  - I want him out of the ocean.
  ans:
  - On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?

- que:
  - You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
  ans:
  - I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.

- que:
  - Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
  ans:
  - I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.

- que:
  - Who's driving the boat?
  ans:
  - Nobody. We're drifting with the current.

- que:
  - Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
  ans:
  - ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.

- que:
  - Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
  ans:
  - You got it?

- que:
  - How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
  ans:
  - I never saw one that big.

- que:
  - What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
  ans:
  - Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.

- que:
  - What's that one, there?
  ans:
  - Tattoo. Had it taken off.

- que:
  - What about us?
  ans:
  - cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.

- que:
  - Do you see the kids?
  ans:
  - Like you're from N'Yawk.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?
  ans:
  - I think they make you look sexy.

- que:
  - Sexy, hm? What was I before?
  ans:
  - Older, sillier.

- que:
  - Can you stand something to eat?
  ans:
  - Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - He's sitting in it.

- que:
  - How come you have to tell them that?
  ans:
  - Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.

- que:
  - Home... New York?
  ans:
  - No. Home here.

- que:
  - You going to be all right?
  ans:
  - Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.

- que:
  - Do I need any more authority?
  ans:
  - Now tell me something I don't know.

- que:
  - So we should set out a smorgasbord?
  ans:
  - I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.

- que:
  - Who's that young man?
  ans:
  - Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.

- que:
  - What kind of a shark did you say it was?
  ans:
  - I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.

- que:
  - You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
  ans:
  - I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...

- que:
  - Dynamite! How was your day...?
  ans:
  - Swell.

- que:
  - Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...

- que:
  - Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
  ans:
  - About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.

- que:
  - Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
  ans:
  - It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.

- que:
  - What stinks so bad?
  ans:
  - Our friend, the shark.

- que:
  - Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
  ans:
  - What's that?

- que:
  - How can you tell?
  ans:
  - Florida license plate.

- que:
  - He ate a car?
  ans:
  - No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.

- que:
  - What is all this stuff?
  ans:
  - Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

- que:
  - Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
  ans:
  - Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.

- que:
  - Where'd you get all this?
  ans:
  - I Bought it. Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.

- que:
  - We gotta get back soon...
  ans:
  - You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I want to check something. Hold my feet.

- que:
  - Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
  ans:
  - They must've hit something.

- que:
  - Why don't we just tow it in?
  ans:
  - We will. There's something I've got to find out.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - No shark did that to a boat!

- que:
  - What's that, a ship?
  ans:
  - You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...

- que:
  - What the hell?
  ans:
  - Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.

- que:
  - Think the tide's with us?
  ans:
  - Just keep kicking.

- que:
  - Christine what?
  ans:
  - Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.

- que:
  - And nobody else saw her in the water?
  ans:
  - Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.

- que:
  - Think she might've run out on you?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.

- que:
  - You from around here?
  ans:
  - No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.

- que:
  - You here for the summer?
  ans:
  - Some friends and me took a house.

- que:
  - What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
  ans:
  - A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

- que:
  - We never had any. What's the problem?
  ans:
  - Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.

- que:
  - What's the matter with my printing?
  ans:
  - That wasn't funny.

- que:
  - I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
  ans:
  - What else could've done that?

- que:
  - It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
  ans:
  - Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.

- que:
  - One more after this, then I'm going home.
  ans:
  - Leg of lamb this time?

- que:
  - You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
  ans:
  - Twenty years.

- que:
  - Is anyone having this...?
  ans:
  - My husband tells me you're in sharks.

- que:
  - You love sharks?
  ans:
  - I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.

- que:
  - Is that a boat?
  ans:
  - Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.

- que:
  - I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - ...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
  ans:
  - This is Quint, Missus.

- que:
  - I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
  ans:
  - He's busy.

- que:
  - Well... is everything all right?
  ans:
  - Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.

- que:
  - What have you got there, Lenny?
  ans:
  - We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.

- que:
  - Who've you told this to, Lenny?
  ans:
  - -- and an America's Cup Trials...

- que:
  - What's that supposed to prove?
  ans:
  - Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...

- que:
  - That's pilot whale, isn't it?
  ans:
  - At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

- que:
  - Ever see one like this?
  ans:
  - Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...

- que:
  - Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
  ans:
  - Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.

- que:
  - Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
  ans:
  - I don't have it.

- que:
  - Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Go Carole. So, guess what?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - So, what do you think we should do?
  ans:
  - Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.

- que:
  - So that's cool with you, then?
  ans:
  - Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.

- que:
  - I'll see you at school, O.K.?
  ans:
  - Well! Nothing like experimenting.

- que:
  - Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
  ans:
  - I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.

- que:
  - Charisma?
  ans:
  - Or something.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.

- que:
  - Really? What are they like?
  ans:
  - The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.

- que:
  - Is that normal?
  ans:
  - I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.

- que:
  - I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
  ans:
  - I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.

- que:
  - Were we together?
  ans:
  - Well, we were once. You know, that time.

- que:
  - Um, hi?
  ans:
  - Leah just told me you were going with her.

- que:
  - You're mad. Why are you mad?
  ans:
  - Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.

- que:
  - What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.

- que:
  - Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
  ans:
  - Yeah. That was me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.

- que:
  - What, you mean as friends?
  ans:
  - No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.

- que:
  - That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
  ans:
  - It does?

- que:
  - Can we make out now?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Did you hear it's yours?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.

- que:
  - I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
  ans:
  - I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

- que:
  - Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
  ans:
  - I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

- que:
  - Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
  ans:
  - Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.

- que:
  - Hon, did you get expelled?
  ans:
  - No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.

- que:
  - Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
  ans:
  - I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.

- que:
  - You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
  ans:
  - That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.

- que:
  - Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
  ans:
  - It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.

- que:
  - You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
  ans:
  - Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.

- que:
  - Shit. Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
  ans:
  - It really didn't hurt that bad having him.

- que:
  - So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
  ans:
  - I'm a junior.

- que:
  - Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
  ans:
  - Shit, yeah. Close it up.

- que:
  - Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
  ans:
  - Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

- que:
  - What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
  ans:
  - I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.

- que:
  - Viscera?
  ans:
  - Blood and guts.

- que:
  - What do you play?
  ans:
  - I rock a Harmony.

- que:
  - What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - When was this, like '96?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
  ans:
  - No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...

- que:
  - Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs... ...They're not bad.

- que:
  - Why aren't you at work?
  ans:
  - I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.

- que:
  - No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
  ans:
  - No, more commercial stuff.

- que:
  - Like what?
  ans:
  - Commercials.

- que:
  - I wrote that.
  ans:
  - Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?

- que:
  - You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
  ans:
  - They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.

- que:
  - Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
  ans:
  - No, he's the dad.

- que:
  - Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
  ans:
  - The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.

- que:
  - Junk?
  ans:
  - You know... it's parts...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - We definitely want it to have junk.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing \"Superstar\" by the Carpenters.

- que:
  - It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
  ans:
  - I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.

- que:
  - The Wizard of Gore?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.

- que:
  - So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
  ans:
  - Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.

- que:
  - God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
  ans:
  - That suits you.

- que:
  - Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
  ans:
  - Why? What the big deal?

- que:
  - Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
  ans:
  - I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Cold feet.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.

- que:
  - Oh really? What's the verdict?
  ans:
  - I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.

- que:
  - Cute?
  ans:
  - Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.

- que:
  - Is Vanessa here?
  ans:
  - Nope. We're safe.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I actually know this one.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.

- que:
  - That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
  ans:
  - Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.

- que:
  - You've never been to a dance, have you?
  ans:
  - Only squares and nerds go to dances.

- que:
  - What are you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.

- que:
  - Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
  ans:
  - That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.

- que:
  - Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
  ans:
  - No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.

- que:
  - Really? Fingernails?
  ans:
  - Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.

- que:
  - Can I take your coats?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You found us in the Penny Saver?
  ans:
  - I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...

- que:
  - Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
  ans:
  - Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.

- que:
  - So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
  ans:
  - I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.

- que:
  - Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing...

- que:
  - Then what's going on?
  ans:
  - I went to the doctor today.

- que:
  - Is the baby okay?
  ans:
  - Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...

- que:
  - What do you mean? You mean... Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
  ans:
  - No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.

- que:
  - Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
  ans:
  - Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.

- que:
  - Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

- que:
  - Juno? What's going on?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Mark? Why is Juno crying?
  ans:
  - I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.

- que:
  - Your name, please?
  ans:
  - Juno MacGuff.

- que:
  - Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
  ans:
  - No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.

- que:
  - Who is the kid?
  ans:
  - The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.

- que:
  - No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - Hi Dad.

- que:
  - Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
  ans:
  - Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.

- que:
  - You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
  ans:
  - I'm losing my faith in humanity.

- que:
  - You mean like couples?
  ans:
  - Please stop now.

- que:
  - Tore up from the floor up?
  ans:
  - I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.

- que:
  - So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.

- que:
  - No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
  ans:
  - Only the one in my pants.

- que:
  - Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
  ans:
  - It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.

- que:
  - How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
  ans:
  - I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.

- que:
  - Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately, yes.

- que:
  - So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
  ans:
  - Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

- que:
  - When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
  ans:
  - Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.

- que:
  - Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
  ans:
  - I'm staying pregnant, Le.

- que:
  - There are ads? For parents?
  ans:
  - Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.

- que:
  - What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
  ans:
  - Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!

- que:
  - Aw, please Junebug?
  ans:
  - No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

- que:
  - Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
  ans:
  - No way! She's pretty.

- que:
  - God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
  ans:
  - Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.

- que:
  - Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
  ans:
  - Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

- que:
  - What do you make with that?
  ans:
  - You don't make anything. It's for exercising.

- que:
  - Are you looking for any other compensation?
  ans:
  - Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.

- que:
  - What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
  ans:
  - You should read the book. I even flagged the \"daddy chapters\" for you.

- que:
  - Juno, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.

- que:
  - What are you referring to?
  ans:
  - I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.

- que:
  - Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
  ans:
  - She answered our prayers.

- que:
  - What would be a good time for you?
  ans:
  - I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.

- que:
  - Like what? Be a rock star?
  ans:
  - Don't mock me.

- que:
  - We're actually, finally doing this?
  ans:
  - Looks like it, yeah.

- que:
  - Have you found a place to stay?
  ans:
  - Yeah, downtown.

- que:
  - A hotel?
  ans:
  - It's a loft.

- que:
  - Aren't you the cool guy?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Carrie.
  ans:
  - Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?

- que:
  - ...Pardon?
  ans:
  - ...I said, I like your hair.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.

- que:
  - Are you takin' the pictures?
  ans:
  - ...Yeah.

- que:
  - Is it hard to learn?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
  ans:
  - ...Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - ...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
  ans:
  - I haven't... I'm a fast learner.

- que:
  - You can?
  ans:
  - I'm cool.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - It's a portfolio of my work.

- que:
  - Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - You took this picture?
  ans:
  - Took 'em all.

- que:
  - You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's Early been in jail for?
  ans:
  - Carryin' a gun.

- que:
  - ...Anything else?
  ans:
  - An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.

- que:
  - Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
  ans:
  - What?

- que:
  - What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
  ans:
  - Almost.

- que:
  - What'll we do out there?
  ans:
  - You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.

- que:
  - What if they're dangerous?
  ans:
  - They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.

- que:
  - Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
  ans:
  - Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.

- que:
  - How many times you gonna tell me that?
  ans:
  - As many times as it takes.

- que:
  - What the hell is this stuff?
  ans:
  - It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...

- que:
  - Yeah but, what is it?
  ans:
  - I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.

- que:
  - Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?
  ans:
  - She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.

- que:
  - What's your name, boy?
  ans:
  - Walter Livesy.

- que:
  - Not so good. You sure you have to?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Wish I did.

- que:
  - Where you from Walter?
  ans:
  - Vernon, Florida.

- que:
  - Never heard of it, any huntin'?
  ans:
  - Turkey mostly.

- que:
  - You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
  ans:
  - No sir.

- que:
  - So what do you do Early?
  ans:
  - Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...

- que:
  - You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
  ans:
  - That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.

- que:
  - How much do I owe you?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - This the book your writing?
  ans:
  - It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Henry Lucas.

- que:
  - How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
  ans:
  - He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.

- que:
  - That bad?
  ans:
  - ...Then some.

- que:
  - ...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
  ans:
  - Dahlia, no.

- que:
  - Now why is that?
  ans:
  - Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.

- que:
  - That your... \"theory\", ain't that what they call it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You wanna hear mine?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Ain't you goin' to record it?
  ans:
  - By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.

- que:
  - Nah... how much money have you got?
  ans:
  - ...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.

- que:
  - Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
  ans:
  - Forget about it, doesn't matter.

- que:
  - So tell me... what happened here?
  ans:
  - Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.

- que:
  - ...and?
  ans:
  - They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.

- que:
  - What happened to Adele?
  ans:
  - Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman.

- que:
  - Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
  ans:
  - A... I gotta go.

- que:
  - The party?
  ans:
  - The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.

- que:
  - ...just like that?
  ans:
  - Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.

- que:
  - Thanks. What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.

- que:
  - So how's it going?
  ans:
  - ...I think it's the best stuff I've done.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.

- que:
  - This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
  ans:
  - Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.

- que:
  - A book on the warehouse murders?
  ans:
  - It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.

- que:
  - I still think we should have met them first.
  ans:
  - What did he sound like on the phone?

- que:
  - Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
  ans:
  - Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?

- que:
  - You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
  ans:
  - He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.

- que:
  - I don't want to talk about it.
  ans:
  - Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?

- que:
  - Take your time.
  ans:
  - All set?

- que:
  - Who said he's my good buddy?
  ans:
  - You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.

- que:
  - She told me... ...but only when she \"deserves\" it. Did you know he was in jail?
  ans:
  - A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.

- que:
  - What about you?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Any word from that gallery?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Nervous?
  ans:
  - ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.

- que:
  - You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
  ans:
  - ...Soon as he finishes his thesis.

- que:
  - Where's Adele?
  ans:
  - She wasn't feeling so good.

- que:
  - ...Need a hand with those bags?
  ans:
  - No, thanks, I can manage.

- que:
  - Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
  ans:
  - ...Brian hurt his foot.

- que:
  - Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - ...never?
  ans:
  - No, never. Excuse me.

- que:
  - ...You know what I mean?
  ans:
  - ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - ...Janitor's job.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - His Parole Officer.

- que:
  - Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
  ans:
  - Could be.

- que:
  - Where would we find him?
  ans:
  - Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.

- que:
  - What about the owner of the house... ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
  ans:
  - No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.

- que:
  - ...Diebold?
  ans:
  - ...That'd be my guess.

- que:
  - How old you?
  ans:
  - 17.

- que:
  - Umm. Altogether?
  ans:
  - Yes. Altogether.

- que:
  - How many times have you gone unprotected?
  ans:
  - With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.

- que:
  - Have you ever had anal intercourse?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - With how many people?
  ans:
  - Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Were they wearing condoms?
  ans:
  - Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.

- que:
  - Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
  ans:
  - Was up bitch?

- que:
  - Well, how was it?
  ans:
  - Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.

- que:
  - She can fuck?
  ans:
  - Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.

- que:
  - How long did you fuck her?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
  ans:
  - Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I can tell that she had just entered puberty.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.

- que:
  - To what? Virgins?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.

- que:
  - Did you tell her that you loved her?
  ans:
  - Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.

- que:
  - Are you hungry?
  ans:
  - Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.

- que:
  - You wanna go to Paul's house?
  ans:
  - What for? That guys a dick.

- que:
  - You think he's got any herb?
  ans:
  - I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.

- que:
  - You think?
  ans:
  - Probably.

- que:
  - He lives on 76th?
  ans:
  - 78th.

- que:
  - Did she suck your dick?
  ans:
  - A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.

- que:
  - It's no big deal, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I feel dehydrated.

- que:
  - You got any money?
  ans:
  - Three pennies and a ball of lint.

- que:
  - You down with the boost?
  ans:
  - Unzip my pack, yo.

- que:
  - The cartoon?
  ans:
  - Yeah. \"The Wonder Twins\". You know. Activate in the form of, a glass of water.

- que:
  - Well, those guys share everything, right?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
  ans:
  - But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Darcy. Benny's little sister.

- que:
  - Oh. You like her?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.

- que:
  - Darcy?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.

- que:
  - It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
  ans:
  - I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.

- que:
  - Why I do what?
  ans:
  - That.

- que:
  - Why I give pennies?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Why you give money.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - So. You never know when you can end up like that.

- que:
  - Good luck?
  ans:
  - Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.

- que:
  - I don't know. How much do you want?
  ans:
  - About ten. Fifteen is good.

- que:
  - You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
  ans:
  - Yeah probably.

- que:
  - Yo, you got any weed around here?
  ans:
  - Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.

- que:
  - You are?
  ans:
  - Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.

- que:
  - Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - Casper, where's Telly.

- que:
  - Casper, where is he?
  ans:
  - Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.

- que:
  - Casper! Was up kid?
  ans:
  - Nothen' B.

- que:
  - Where you at?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - Where you goin' tonight?
  ans:
  - Maybe Nasa. I don't know.

- que:
  - You goin'?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I'm goin'. You on the list?
  ans:
  - Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.

- que:
  - Yo, you think we killed that guy?
  ans:
  - Na.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.

- que:
  - Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
  ans:
  - Man we fucked him up.

- que:
  - Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
  ans:
  - Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nuffin' G. Just forget it.

- que:
  - Sup then? Sup?
  ans:
  - Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.

- que:
  - Hey. What are you doin' right now?
  ans:
  - I was just getting ready to take a bath.

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Come on.

- que:
  - Is it cold?
  ans:
  - You know I've been thinking about you lately.

- que:
  - You have?
  ans:
  - Yeah. After I saw you last week.

- que:
  - At the block party?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You were?
  ans:
  - Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.

- que:
  - Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
  ans:
  - No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.

- que:
  - She won't? Why not?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I can understand that.

- que:
  - Tonight?
  ans:
  - Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.

- que:
  - Do you like kissing me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I just know. I know you'll love it.

- que:
  - Nothing?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.

- que:
  - Do you care about me?
  ans:
  - Of course I do.

- que:
  - Fine Fidget. What's all this?
  ans:
  - Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.

- que:
  - Who are they?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Bang up stuff.

- que:
  - You know what I want to do?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What do I want to do?
  ans:
  - You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because, you know why. You know.

- que:
  - Because your a virgin?
  ans:
  - Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.

- que:
  - I wouldn't believe it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I just think that you would love it.

- que:
  - Do you care about me?
  ans:
  - Come dance.

- que:
  - I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
  ans:
  - Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.

- que:
  - Telly is at Steven's?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - 15.

- que:
  - How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
  ans:
  - One.

- que:
  - Have you ever had anal intercourse?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...

- que:
  - I tested positive?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - No. I'm OK. Thanks.

- que:
  - You're OK?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Miss, would I be prying?
  ans:
  - Everything is wrong.

- que:
  - No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I guess so.

- que:
  - Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you in trouble with the law?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Am I getting warm?
  ans:
  - Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Thanks.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.

- que:
  - What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
  ans:
  - Your a real philosopher.

- que:
  - Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
  ans:
  - It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.

- que:
  - I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
  ans:
  - Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.

- que:
  - I know.
  ans:
  - You still mad at him?

- que:
  - Did you bleed?
  ans:
  - I didn't bleed.

- que:
  - You didn't?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't bleed.

- que:
  - Mine?
  ans:
  - Mine are like my neck and my chest.

- que:
  - Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.

- que:
  - Do you know where he went?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.

- que:
  - OWNER Whah is dissdee?
  ans:
  - Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.

- que:
  - OWNER Whah you say? Dissdee?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.

- que:
  - You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Have you ever swallowed it before?
  ans:
  - Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.

- que:
  - Did they ask you a lot of questions?
  ans:
  - How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.

- que:
  - You think so?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.

- que:
  - You've heard the stories right?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Holy shit. That's all true?
  ans:
  - No. I was just kidding.

- que:
  - Hi Telly. Where you been?
  ans:
  - Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.

- que:
  - When are you gonna be back?
  ans:
  - Not too late.

- que:
  - Four-thirty in the morning?
  ans:
  - Not too late.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - It's me. Telly.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Paul it's Telly. Open up.

- que:
  - What are you guys doing?
  ans:
  - Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.

- que:
  - You want a wip-it?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - So, how many people live here now?
  ans:
  - I don't know, eight or nine.

- que:
  - Where does everyone sleep?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.

- que:
  - What man? What is it?
  ans:
  - Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.

- que:
  - Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
  ans:
  - Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip.

- que:
  - By yourself?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What kind of problem?
  ans:
  - I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - Casual.

- que:
  - It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
  ans:
  - You are! I don't like you.

- que:
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.

- que:
  - You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
  ans:
  - He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.

- que:
  - What do you mean, no?
  ans:
  - He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.

- que:
  - Are you crazy?
  ans:
  - Let's see how much he wants to play.

- que:
  - You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it. You think I'm right?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know.

- que:
  - How'd you get in here?
  ans:
  - The door was open.

- que:
  - You ever do any hunting, Peter?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
  ans:
  - Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.

- que:
  - Then what's he talking about?
  ans:
  - If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.

- que:
  - You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
  ans:
  - I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.

- que:
  - What's the first street?
  ans:
  - Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.

- que:
  - Local?
  ans:
  - No. She just moved here last month from Portland.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.

- que:
  - You think he's dirty?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.

- que:
  - What was your relationship with her?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first- timer.

- que:
  - You still having a problem with this?
  ans:
  - We've checked. There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.

- que:
  - I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
  ans:
  - I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.

- que:
  - Sanderson?
  ans:
  - I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's a voice modulator.

- que:
  - Ready for round two?
  ans:
  - I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while.

- que:
  - Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe there's two of them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.

- que:
  - Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
  ans:
  - Did anyone stand out?

- que:
  - What was suspicious about him?
  ans:
  - It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you.

- que:
  - Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
  ans:
  - To get your attention.

- que:
  - Did you know her?
  ans:
  - No, only the path she chose to travel.

- que:
  - And -- what path is that?
  ans:
  - We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me.

- que:
  - Why did you write remember on the wall?
  ans:
  - That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.

- que:
  - Where is she?
  ans:
  - Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.

- que:
  - You know her?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Why her?
  ans:
  - Because she's the type.

- que:
  - Just like who?
  ans:
  - I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.

- que:
  - And you want these girls to feel your pain?
  ans:
  - Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.

- que:
  - If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
  ans:
  - I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well.

- que:
  - What makes you think I was there?
  ans:
  - I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.

- que:
  - Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing?
  ans:
  - You're playing the Tarakoss opening.

- que:
  - The police haven't told you?
  ans:
  - They think that you and I are doing this together.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter.

- que:
  - Very good. How did you know?
  ans:
  - The pipes.

- que:
  - How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
  ans:
  - You told me. When you called you said she was in the other room. Drop the knife.

- que:
  - What's this?
  ans:
  - Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind.

- que:
  - Can we correlate data? Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
  ans:
  - No problem. We're in.

- que:
  - Set up some pieces on the big board?
  ans:
  - Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me. There can't be more than a handful.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich.

- que:
  - Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why?
  ans:
  - You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours.

- que:
  - What scars?
  ans:
  - The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.

- que:
  - The police came to me for help. What could I do?
  ans:
  - I just can't believe it.

- que:
  - Why did he what?
  ans:
  - Come here.

- que:
  - Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
  ans:
  - You're losing me.

- que:
  - So, are you having a good time on the Island?
  ans:
  - Not really. It's pretty boring.

- que:
  - That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?
  ans:
  - Boys.

- que:
  - Do you like my dad?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - How do you know that? Did he say something?
  ans:
  - No... but I can tell. A woman knows these things.

- que:
  - What are you doing up?
  ans:
  - I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.

- que:
  - I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
  ans:
  - That has nothing to do with it.

- que:
  - You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.

- que:
  - Has he gotten through to any?
  ans:
  - No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.

- que:
  - What is it, dad?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Don't you have something you want to say to David?
  ans:
  - Thanks, David.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.

- que:
  - Whaddaya got, Nolan?
  ans:
  - Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.

- que:
  - How long has she been dead?
  ans:
  - Six, eight hours tops.

- que:
  - Any sign of rape?
  ans:
  - Not that I can see. We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.

- que:
  - There's no blood. Where's the fuckin' blood?
  ans:
  - Bingo.

- que:
  - What about prints?
  ans:
  - No prints.

- que:
  - You mean, no prints but hers?
  ans:
  - No Frank. No prints.

- que:
  - There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood?
  ans:
  - Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.

- que:
  - Same as the others?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - How long she been dead?
  ans:
  - I'd say at least eighteen hours.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.

- que:
  - Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on. What'd he do?
  ans:
  - We're not sure.

- que:
  - What do you think he did?
  ans:
  - No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.

- que:
  - Meaning?
  ans:
  - His home would be... Mount Olympus.

- que:
  - He moves around a lot. Why?
  ans:
  - Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.

- que:
  - What time did he get there?
  ans:
  - About a quarter to one.

- que:
  - What are you saying? That I'm seeing what I want to see? That I'm protecting a murderer? What?
  ans:
  - We can't rely on your judgement anymore.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - No. He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist. It was Peter.

- que:
  - I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
  ans:
  - I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.

- que:
  - Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in. How long ago was that?
  ans:
  - Ten days ago.

- que:
  - Do you know how she found the apartment?
  ans:
  - Through a rental agency.

- que:
  - I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?
  ans:
  - Only in passing. To say hello to.

- que:
  - Could you tell me where you were last night?
  ans:
  - Here. I played Gregory Lutz.

- que:
  - I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that?
  ans:
  - To my room and then I went for a walk.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I was afraid there'd be hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game.

- que:
  - What have you come up with on the riddle?
  ans:
  - \"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street.\" We think he might be making a reference to himself.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - We think he might be making a reference to drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.

- que:
  - \"Is\". Did you tell him about the institute?
  ans:
  - As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.

- que:
  - A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
  ans:
  - He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.

- que:
  - Are we going to go through this again?
  ans:
  - Answer the question.

- que:
  - Did you send the car?
  ans:
  - It's over, Peter. Let's stop the games. I'm not sending a car.

- que:
  - I suppose you have something in mind?
  ans:
  - It's a good play, but risky.

- que:
  - We got a problem?
  ans:
  - Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.

- que:
  - Is it serious?
  ans:
  - Peter...

- que:
  - You have something you want to say?
  ans:
  - Just thought you might want to talk.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Whatever's on your mind.

- que:
  - What do you see here?
  ans:
  - Mate in five.

- que:
  - She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Feel like practicing?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Just let me grab a shower.

- que:
  - What are they, please?
  ans:
  - \"Carefully\". \"Carefully\". \"Carefully\".

- que:
  - Is this your first time here?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Because I love them, but they drive me crazy. You know how parents are?
  ans:
  - No. I don't.

- que:
  - Are you with the tournament?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - Are you one of the players?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I've always wanted to learn how to play chess. I don't have the patience for it. When did you start playing?
  ans:
  - When I was very young.

- que:
  - If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
  ans:
  - That's a very personal question.

- que:
  - Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
  ans:
  - I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.

- que:
  - Are we talking about me, or chess?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I just came in for a steam.

- que:
  - Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
  ans:
  - I don't think I could.

- que:
  - Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
  ans:
  - I think it's interesting.

- que:
  - Another kind of game?
  ans:
  - In a way.

- que:
  - How can you look at it so clinically?
  ans:
  - Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.

- que:
  - What about you? Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Let's change the subject.

- que:
  - Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married?
  ans:
  - I'm just curious.

- que:
  - Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
  ans:
  - You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.

- que:
  - I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I work with them.

- que:
  - You're not?
  ans:
  - No -- I'm not involved. And I plan on keeping it that way.

- que:
  - Doesn't that scare you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because I think he's wrong.

- que:
  - Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
  ans:
  - No. But I'm open to distractions.

- que:
  - Wasn't I just talking about me?
  ans:
  - No. You were talking about chess.

- que:
  - I dunno. Where's Erica mother?
  ans:
  - She died in a car accident.

- que:
  - It must've been very hard on Erica?
  ans:
  - It was.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.

- que:
  - What is this?
  ans:
  - I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.

- que:
  - What? By attacking me?
  ans:
  - What are you talking about? You don't even know me.

- que:
  - Does anyone?
  ans:
  - I just don't want to fight with you.

- que:
  - You can turn everything around so easily. This is not just another game, is it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you want on it?
  ans:
  - You.

- que:
  - Would you settle for pepperoni?
  ans:
  - If I have to. I'm going to take a shower.

- que:
  - Did you call?
  ans:
  - The line was busy. I'll try again.

- que:
  - I thought you said the line was busy?
  ans:
  - I tried again and got through.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Peter, you have to admit--
  ans:
  - Peter...

- que:
  - For emphasis?
  ans:
  - Exactly. It's the key.

- que:
  - But what does he mean by a fierce magazine? Violent?
  ans:
  - A fierce magazine... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine... fierce... Mad.

- que:
  - Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
  ans:
  - Right. Here! c-4.

- que:
  - Can I come in?
  ans:
  - I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.

- que:
  - This letter. I've never opened it.
  ans:
  - Why?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because I know what it says.

- que:
  - How did you know it was \"carefully\"?
  ans:
  - Frank told me.

- que:
  - This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
  ans:
  - Of course not.

- que:
  - Are you going to come tonight?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'll be there later.

- que:
  - Do we have a future?
  ans:
  - I'm sure you are.

- que:
  - You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
  ans:
  - I'm not nervous.

- que:
  - Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We're almost married.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - I can't wait either.

- que:
  - Have they harmed you?
  ans:
  - No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.

- que:
  - Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
  ans:
  - In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.

- que:
  - Where is the Fortress?
  ans:
  - I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.

- que:
  - Does the Queen live?
  ans:
  - The new Queen lives.

- que:
  - Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
  ans:
  - In the old books. It's called a glaive.

- que:
  - Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
  ans:
  - There is no other way.

- que:
  - You have rope?
  ans:
  - I am too old to climb down a rope.

- que:
  - The Fortress moves?
  ans:
  - Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.

- que:
  - You choose these?
  ans:
  - Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.

- que:
  - They know when they're going to die?
  ans:
  - Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.

- que:
  - What do you see?
  ans:
  - Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Lyssa? Why?
  ans:
  - Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.

- que:
  - Can she be forced?
  ans:
  - I found the body of the Seer in the stream.

- que:
  - What will happen?
  ans:
  - They can be saddled.

- que:
  - You have done it?
  ans:
  - I road them often in my youth.

- que:
  - It is today?
  ans:
  - Yes. It is today.

- que:
  - Am I not worth returning to?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Even by you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You will not, then?
  ans:
  - I cannot.

- que:
  - It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death. Where is this place?
  ans:
  - A forest near the Valley of Needles.

- que:
  - What business?
  ans:
  - Staying alive.

- que:
  - Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
  ans:
  - Fame.

- que:
  - How did you know I had sons?
  ans:
  - Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.

- que:
  - And where do you lead, boy?
  ans:
  - To the place where Death lives.

- que:
  - When did you last sleep, boy?
  ans:
  - I'm all right.

- que:
  - Not sleepy, either?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What kind of friend do you think I am?
  ans:
  - The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.

- que:
  - Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
  ans:
  - Go. I command you.

- que:
  - Would you settle for a boar?
  ans:
  - I am Quell.

- que:
  - What is that awful looking place?
  ans:
  - The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - We'll meet you at the inn.

- que:
  - Can't I come, too?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Quell?
  ans:
  - I cannot go with you, my friend.

- que:
  - Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Sugarballs?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - You can have half.

- que:
  - One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
  ans:
  - I only want one.

- que:
  - A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
  ans:
  - Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...

- que:
  - What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
  ans:
  - I don't think it's working.

- que:
  - And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
  ans:
  - Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so ugly.

- que:
  - Would you desert your friends?
  ans:
  - No, no. I'm with you, boy.

- que:
  - And do you think I live on air?
  ans:
  - We have plenty of hares.

- que:
  - I am being exploited! Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.

- que:
  - And who is he?
  ans:
  - He is the King.

- que:
  - What news from our friends?
  ans:
  - Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.

- que:
  - Freylag's stronghold?
  ans:
  - It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.

- que:
  - You were attacked in the forest?
  ans:
  - Yes. We lost five.

- que:
  - How many did you lose?
  ans:
  - Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.

- que:
  - Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
  ans:
  - The new King.

- que:
  - With an old voice?
  ans:
  - You know the voice.

- que:
  - Can you see?
  ans:
  - Yes. It is the Western Ocean.

- que:
  - The leader of the Dark Ones?
  ans:
  - Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.

- que:
  - The Widow of the Web?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - She bore you many children?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
  ans:
  - Knowledge.

- que:
  - Why must you know?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why do you want to know?
  ans:
  - He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.

- que:
  - Yeah... How do you know it?
  ans:
  - ...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.

- que:
  - Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
  ans:
  - Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you. But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?

- que:
  - Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
  ans:
  - No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.

- que:
  - YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
  ans:
  - No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.

- que:
  - ...Good... But what's special in him?
  ans:
  - ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.

- que:
  - ...You moved too, didn't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
  ans:
  - ...Not at all.

- que:
  - At a certain moment I thought, maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
  ans:
  - Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.

- que:
  - Do you need money?
  ans:
  - No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.

- que:
  - Pay attention to women, Leon. They are dangerous, you know?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.

- que:
  - Huh... 500 meters?
  ans:
  - 130... 140...

- que:
  - What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
  ans:
  - Rocket launcher.

- que:
  - Yeah... Come on, have a little training.
  ans:
  - Oh really? But can you miss the car?

- que:
  - Who'll I aim at?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
  ans:
  - Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.

- que:
  - Mathilda? May I come in?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - May I go to the cinema?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Too heavy.

- que:
  - Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
  ans:
  - I never rent my gear.

- que:
  - And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
  ans:
  - ...I'm going to kiss you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - When I say I love you.

- que:
  - Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
  ans:
  - ...17.

- que:
  - What shall we do?
  ans:
  - I think.

- que:
  - ...Why didn't he close the window?
  ans:
  - It's cool departing this way... warm... music...

- que:
  - You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
  ans:
  - A little...

- que:
  - Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
  ans:
  - There are just two things I'm interested in, love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!

- que:
  - Poor darling, and then?
  ans:
  - Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.

- que:
  - ...Don't you drink?
  ans:
  - I prefer waiting for a while... I feel it would go the wrong way.

- que:
  - How many girlfriends did you have?
  ans:
  - ...I don't know.

- que:
  - Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
  ans:
  - ...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.

- que:
  - You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - May I ask you a personal question?
  ans:
  - ...Yes.

- que:
  - What do you do, with the money you earn?
  ans:
  - Nothing, for the moment.

- que:
  - Yeah, what?
  ans:
  - I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this...

- que:
  - It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
  ans:
  - I don't know... Five minutes.

- que:
  - It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
  ans:
  - How shall we get out now, Leon?

- que:
  - ...Yes?
  ans:
  - Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...

- que:
  - How are you, Miss?
  ans:
  - Fine...

- que:
  - Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
  ans:
  - ...Composer.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - ...No... he's my lover...

- que:
  - Huh? Why?
  ans:
  - Because you have to pay. It's like a parking meter, if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...

- que:
  - ...And how much is it?
  ans:
  - Ten dollars... A month.

- que:
  - Can I sit on the stairways now?
  ans:
  - Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.

- que:
  - Rinaldi... Rinaldi... What region do you come from?
  ans:
  - Messina.

- que:
  - But... He works for your same employer?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but I don't give a shit about. I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...

- que:
  - ...Who sent you?
  ans:
  - Giancarlo... Rinaldi.

- que:
  - Is he still alive?
  ans:
  - Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.

  ans:
  - No... Dino's.

- que:
  - Have you ever been in Messina, son?
  ans:
  - Yes... Twice.

- que:
  - Did you fish in Messina? The \"pesce spada\"?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Do you recognize him?
  ans:
  - ...Even his mother wouldn't.

- que:
  - May we have this wolf's name and address?
  ans:
  - These guys have no place. They change virtually everyday. And his name... It's a surname.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - For a walk. I don't know.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.

- que:
  - Why am I such an authority?
  ans:
  - Here comes the resume.

- que:
  - Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
  ans:
  - High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles. They're nasty.

- que:
  - And your store? What about your new store? What about all your dreams?
  ans:
  - I have new dreams now.

- que:
  - She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
  ans:
  - You'd be visiting me at Nasa.

- que:
  - What if you don't make it?
  ans:
  - I'll make it.

- que:
  - Are you two planning kids?
  ans:
  - Maybe later.

- que:
  - How serious is it?
  ans:
  - Then it'll have to wait until I finish.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.

- que:
  - What would you like us to do?
  ans:
  - Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.

- que:
  - How long does this... Mania last?
  ans:
  - A couple days to a few months if untreated.

- que:
  - Are you a preacher?
  ans:
  - No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.

- que:
  - A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife? Crushed her like a bug. Snapped her bones?
  ans:
  - That's enough.

- que:
  - Can it kill me?
  ans:
  - It can, but it'll have to wait in line.

- que:
  - What steps do we take now?
  ans:
  - We operate. We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.

- que:
  - What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
  ans:
  - It's hard to say. It's a delicate surgery. There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.

- que:
  - Pardon?
  ans:
  - I mean why the sudden voluntary visit -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...

- que:
  - Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy?
  ans:
  - Yes -- you are.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - I've seen it before.

- que:
  - You have?

  ans:
  - Twenty miles? I see.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - The flowers... they're beautiful.

- que:
  - You thought I sent them?
  ans:
  - There was no card.

- que:
  - Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day?
  ans:
  - It's just a regular day.

- que:
  - The new store?
  ans:
  - Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we should just do it.

- que:
  - Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
  ans:
  - Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.

- que:
  - I want to be shown... Maurice would you do anything for me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Anything?
  ans:
  - No I don't. I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.

- que:
  - Why do you polish it?
  ans:
  - A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.

- que:
  - Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Then why?
  ans:
  - There's no reason.

- que:
  - You like to take walks?
  ans:
  - No. But I want to take a walk with you.

  ans:
  - The beach of Pacifica, California.

- que:
  - What did they ask?
  ans:
  - If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.

- que:
  - To where?
  ans:
  - Pacifica, California.

- que:
  - From where?
  ans:
  - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

- que:
  - Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
  ans:
  - Most certainly.

- que:
  - Doubts? About what?
  ans:
  - About my love for her.

- que:
  - What's his story?
  ans:
  - His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.

- que:

  - I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home?
  ans:
  - You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.

- que:
  - Is that right?
  ans:
  - You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.

- que:
  - You tell stories?
  ans:
  - Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...

- que:
  - Who's telling this story?
  ans:
  - That's me.

- que:
  - Perhaps there's another route?
  ans:
  - Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.

- que:
  - This story is big huh?
  ans:
  - Mammoth.

- que:
  - Umm, Coalville Utah.
  ans:
  - The Gazette's small huh?

- que:
  - Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
  ans:
  - Maybe.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Never have children. If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.

- que:
  - Are you firing me?
  ans:
  - No. No... I won't be here for a while. The store will be closed in the interim.

- que:
  - You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
  ans:
  - I told you.

- que:
  - You're walking to California?
  ans:
  - Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.

- que:
  - I'm really lost. What does this have to do with walking?
  ans:
  - I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.

- que:
  - Why know?
  ans:
  - Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.

- que:
  - What Mr. Parker?
  ans:
  - She never ate a slice.

- que:
  - Tom Joad?
  ans:
  - ... The Grapes of Wrath.

- que:
  - Are they standing?
  ans:
  - Saluting.

- que:
  - What, come on?
  ans:
  - I can't do it. I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.

- que:
  - Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
  ans:
  - Don't do this.

- que:
  - Where am I?
  ans:
  - In a hospital.

- que:
  - What do your friends call you?
  ans:
  - Steph.

- que:
  - Do you have a car, Steph?
  ans:
  - You're in pain.

- que:
  - You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
  ans:
  - Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.

- que:
  - Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here?
  ans:
  - You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.

- que:
  - Is it a boy or a girl?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's not mine.

- que:
  - You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
  ans:
  - Forty-seven years.

- que:
  - Where did he go?
  ans:
  - He's getting my sweater from the car. I said there was a breeze. I told him not to go.

- que:
  - May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How are you feeling?
  ans:
  - Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.

- que:
  - What? Who are you?
  ans:
  - If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.

- que:
  - Evening News?
  ans:
  - We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.

- que:
  - What are my choices?
  ans:
  - Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.

- que:
  - Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
  ans:
  - ...Noooo.

- que:
  - Orange soda?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Coffee?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Sparkling apple cider?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Water?
  ans:
  - One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.

- que:
  - Are you working?
  ans:
  - Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.

- que:
  - That's funny. I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
  ans:
  - That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.

- que:
  - Sarah -- with an H?
  ans:
  - No -- S.E.R.A.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - I sometimes fade out.

- que:
  - Mind if I use the bathroom?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
  ans:
  - OK... whatever.

- que:
  - What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
  ans:
  - No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...

- que:
  - To death?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's right.

- que:
  - How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
  ans:
  - I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.

- que:
  - Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
  ans:
  - Yeah. And your meter just ran out.

- que:
  - No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
  ans:
  - I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - This is the home of an angel.

- que:
  - You OK out there?
  ans:
  - Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.

- que:
  - You OK?
  ans:
  - Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.

- que:
  - Thank you. What time is it?
  ans:
  - Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.

- que:
  - Is that really what you want to ask me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
  ans:
  - Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.

- que:
  - What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
  ans:
  - Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.

- que:
  - I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better. Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
  ans:
  - Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.

- que:
  - Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
  ans:
  - There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.

- que:
  - So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
  ans:
  - What do you mean?

- que:
  - Don't be silly?
  ans:
  - Sera... what you don't understand is...

- que:
  - You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
  ans:
  - Hi!

- que:
  - Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
  ans:
  - Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.

- que:
  - Ben?
  ans:
  - Sorry.

- que:
  - Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
  ans:
  - OK.

- que:
  - Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
  ans:
  - Well... OK...

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - I know that...

- que:
  - Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
  ans:
  - I'm going to fill it right now.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.

- que:
  - That's impressive. How did you do that?
  ans:
  - I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.

- que:
  - We?
  ans:
  - I warned you... ...but I'm sorry.

- que:
  - That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
  ans:
  - Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.

- que:
  - Can we just forget it?
  ans:
  - I don't understand any of that.

- que:
  - Thank you, Sera.
  ans:
  - Can we just ignore it?

- que:
  - Do you want me not to go tonight?
  ans:
  - No... we already talked about that.

- que:
  - Shall we go away for a couple of days?
  ans:
  - Yeah... I'd like that.

- que:
  - Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
  ans:
  - Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.

- que:
  - I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
  ans:
  - I didn't know I'd ever need it again.

- que:
  - Will you lighten up, please?
  ans:
  - One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.

- que:
  - You know I love you... yeah?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hey, Brad... how's it going?
  ans:
  - Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.

- que:
  - How'd this happen?
  ans:
  - I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.

- que:
  - How much, do you think?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'll find out though.

- que:
  - Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
  ans:
  - Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.

- que:
  - So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
  ans:
  - Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.

- que:
  - Right here at the hotel. Why?
  ans:
  - Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.

- que:
  - You have been lonely?
  ans:
  - I've been all right.

- que:
  - You have been lonely?
  ans:
  - I am lonely, Yuri.

- que:
  - Where have you been staying?
  ans:
  - With an old friend.

- que:
  - Where have you been?
  ans:
  - It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.

- que:
  - A full night on the street and this is all?
  ans:
  - Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.

- que:
  - Yes? What?
  ans:
  - It's me, Yuri.

- que:
  - Have you told anyone that I'm here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Harvard Law School?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced \"History of Lycra\". What are your backups?
  ans:
  - I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.

- que:
  - What alibi?
  ans:
  - I can't tell you.

- que:
  - You understand you're on trial for murder?
  ans:
  - Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.

- que:
  - Why would I kill my husband?
  ans:
  - Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.

- que:
  - Were you with another man?
  ans:
  - Go to hell.

- que:
  - Are we done for today?
  ans:
  - I believe we are.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're fired. I have new representation.

- que:
  - Is he always such an ass?
  ans:
  - He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.

- que:
  - But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
  ans:
  - He's an ass that's gonna try.

- que:
  - He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
  ans:
  - That's not what's important.

- que:
  - You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
  ans:
  - Sort of.

- que:
  - Who could better understand than me?
  ans:
  - I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.

- que:
  - Did she have a weapon in her hand?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
  ans:
  - Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.

- que:
  - Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
  ans:
  - His dead body with a bullet in it.

- que:
  - Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
  ans:
  - Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.

- que:
  - And when you came downstairs, what happened?
  ans:
  - I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.

- que:
  - But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
  ans:
  - No, she'd stashed it by then.

- que:
  - Did you hear a shot fired?
  ans:
  - No. I was in the shower.

- que:
  - So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
  ans:
  - I guess.

- que:
  - Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
  ans:
  - I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.

- que:
  - Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How many, would you say?
  ans:
  - Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.

- que:
  - Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
  ans:
  - Because they got wet.

- que:
  - Who's askin'?
  ans:
  - I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Tell him, Paulette.

- que:
  - Did you get it?
  ans:
  - Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.

- que:
  - Is everything okay?
  ans:
  - You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.

- que:
  - You're hitting on me?
  ans:
  - You're a beautiful girl, Elle.

- que:
  - What did you see when you entered the house?
  ans:
  - I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.

- que:
  - Was she carrying a weapon?
  ans:
  - No, she was crying her eyes out.

- que:
  - Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
  ans:
  - Just the love in my heart.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.

- que:
  - Uh -- both?
  ans:
  - Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Aristotle.

- que:
  - Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - After you went to all that trouble?
  ans:
  - She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.

- que:
  - Is she?
  ans:
  - She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.

- que:
  - You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
  ans:
  - Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? So you're sure, this Warner guy is \"the one\"?

- que:
  - You ready?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
  ans:
  - No. Sometimes I say \"Okay\" instead of \"Fine\".

- que:
  - Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
  ans:
  - Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.

- que:
  - Licensed attorney or family member?
  ans:
  - Uh -- family.

- que:
  - Relation?
  ans:
  - I'm her sister.

- que:
  - Name?
  ans:
  - Delta. Gamma.

- que:
  - You know her?
  ans:
  - Our group is full.

- que:
  - Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
  ans:
  - The idiot speaks.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.

- que:
  - Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
  ans:
  - Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?

- que:
  - Too demure?
  ans:
  - I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.

- que:
  - What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
  ans:
  - Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.

- que:
  - Here. You're gonna need this.
  ans:
  - So?

- que:
  - Your scrunchie?
  ans:
  - My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.

- que:
  - Not yet.
  ans:
  - Elle, do you know what happened on \"Days of Our Lives\" yesterday?

- que:
  - Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
  ans:
  - The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.

- que:
  - And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
  ans:
  - You have Stromwell.

- que:
  - Did she do that to you, too?
  ans:
  - Neat.

- que:
  - Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
  ans:
  - My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...

- que:
  - How do you figure?
  ans:
  - Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.

- que:
  - Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
  ans:
  - No, she can't move for an hour.

- que:
  - How can you still believe she's innocent?
  ans:
  - You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.

- que:
  - Okay, how would it work?
  ans:
  - I can't.

- que:
  - Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
  ans:
  - That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.

- que:
  - What the hell is that for?
  ans:
  - The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.

- que:
  - You really think I'm attractive?
  ans:
  - Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.

- que:
  - Whoa -- Why?
  ans:
  - As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.

- que:
  - So Friday at eight?
  ans:
  - Someone missed you.

- que:
  - Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
  ans:
  - Is he the only one?

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know! I don't know anything any more! I just need to be by myself.

- que:
  - You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
  ans:
  - Are you sure?

- que:
  - Where's Warner?
  ans:
  - I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'd rather have a client who's innocent.

- que:
  - Yes? Ms. Woods?
  ans:
  - I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.

- que:
  - You should. Do you have a resume?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - Class schedule, map, book list.
  ans:
  - You don't really believe she's innocent?

- que:
  - Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
  ans:
  - Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.

- que:
  - Your what?
  ans:
  - You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.

- que:
  - There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
  ans:
  - I guess it'll have to...

- que:
  - Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
  ans:
  - You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?

- que:
  - How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
  ans:
  - I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.

- que:
  - What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
  ans:
  - No, silly. I go here.

- que:
  - You go where?
  ans:
  - Harvard. Law school.

- que:
  - Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
  ans:
  - Uh -- sure.

- que:
  - So -- uh -- how was your first class?
  ans:
  - Good. Good.

- que:
  - Do anything exciting?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.

- que:
  - Thank you. Having fun?
  ans:
  - Now I am.

- que:
  - See?
  ans:
  - Thanks for the backup.

- que:
  - How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
  ans:
  - It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - In court. On opposing sides.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.

- que:
  - Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.

- que:
  - And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
  ans:
  - Three months.

- que:
  - And what is your boyfriend's name?
  ans:
  - Chuck.

- que:
  - VANDERMARK But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
  ans:
  - Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?

- que:
  - Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
  ans:
  - Faith.

- que:
  - Then we smash 'em?
  ans:
  - Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.

- que:
  - You go? Not watch fun?
  ans:
  - I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.

- que:
  - Fire moat... why do that?
  ans:
  - Purely a precaution...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.

- que:
  - Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
  ans:
  - We go out, smash 'em now?

- que:
  - More fun win battle?
  ans:
  - This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.

- que:
  - You go to lady now?
  ans:
  - To finish last evening's delightful work.

- que:
  - What do you want with me?
  ans:
  - Your love.

- que:
  - And you... are you not also afraid?
  ans:
  - I am afraid of nothing.

- que:
  - Protection?
  ans:
  - Like some vile toadstool.

- que:
  - Do you feed on mice and rats?
  ans:
  - I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.

- que:
  - Why have you brought me here?
  ans:
  - To be my bride, of course.

- que:
  - Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
  ans:
  - Kill me... I want... so nice...

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - At the moment, very little. Your company at my table...

- que:
  - We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes...

- que:
  - What will become of me then?
  ans:
  - It's nothing. My men take great delight in routing the enemy. Don't trouble yourself, beauty.

- que:
  - Might we watch, too?
  ans:
  - Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...

- que:
  - Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
  ans:
  - It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust. I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...

- que:
  - And, now?
  ans:
  - Now I want to live forever. I've never felt so strong or happy.

- que:
  - You come stealee tleasoo?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.

- que:
  - No need lie, boy. I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
  ans:
  - Well, er... no. I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.

- que:
  - Cathay?
  ans:
  - Country fa' fa' away. To the East, beyond the lising sun...

- que:
  - You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
  ans:
  - Dlagon not like that. Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.

- que:
  - Oh no... Don't you understand?
  ans:
  - No, wait... please... listen...

- que:
  - Who might these friends be?
  ans:
  - Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk. We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.

- que:
  - Gump, is it?
  ans:
  - Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.

- que:
  - Faerie ring?
  ans:
  - To be sure.

- que:
  - And if I cannot?
  ans:
  - Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.

- que:
  - Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
  ans:
  - I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.

- que:
  - What does she want from me?
  ans:
  - Elderberry wine. No finer drink under heaven.

- que:
  - He is afraid of enchantment! Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
  ans:
  - Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --

- que:
  - Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
  ans:
  - Aye. Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.

- que:
  - Don't you know?
  ans:
  - If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...

- que:
  - Then, what's gone wrong? Why did it happen?
  ans:
  - If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.

- que:
  - Don't you care about what's happened?
  ans:
  - There must be an answer somewhere.

- que:
  - Will you lead me to her?
  ans:
  - Aye. On the morrow we go, but tonight... ... tonight is for making merry.

- que:
  - Are we here?
  ans:
  - Aye. That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells. Oona... lure her out. Play the part of a girl-child.

- que:
  - What do I do?
  ans:
  - Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.

- que:
  - And if she thinks me a liar?
  ans:
  - Fie on what she thinks! You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.

- que:
  - Bravely spoke. You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
  ans:
  - Time for a champion. Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?

- que:
  - Twill take more than heart. Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
  ans:
  - I know where to find it. Taking possession be another matter.

- que:
  - Have we turned grave-robber, then?
  ans:
  - A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.

- que:
  - And who might that be?
  ans:
  - No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.

- que:
  - So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
  ans:
  - Knaves and robbers...

- que:
  - What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
  ans:
  - You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise. Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Something's coming.

- que:
  - Pregnant, is she?
  ans:
  - It would appear so.

- que:
  - I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...! Want to see me do it?
  ans:
  - We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.

- que:
  - How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
  ans:
  - A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed. The Baron must have left a trail.

- que:
  - Aye. Said to follow it to the edge of night. But is this the right bird?
  ans:
  - I'm sure. It spoke to me.

- que:
  - Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
  ans:
  - Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.

- que:
  - Blackheart?
  ans:
  - Aye. He's enchanted the lot of them. His reward for delivering the unicorn.

- que:
  - What know you of fields of war?
  ans:
  - There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.

- que:
  - Stealing his arms?
  ans:
  - Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.

- que:
  - And this? Some of their handiwork?
  ans:
  - Nay. That's but to distract the casual visitor. A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.

- que:
  - What make ye of that, Jack?
  ans:
  - It bodes evil.

- que:
  - Is she... dead?
  ans:
  - No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.

- que:
  - We're blind now. Oona was our eyes and ears. How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
  ans:
  - We'll find it.

- que:
  - No... but what choice have we?
  ans:
  - Never felt so cold in all me born days...

- que:
  - Why not mine the damned walls?
  ans:
  - We do both. Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...

- que:
  - A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
  ans:
  - Defend ourselves. We've bested far worse already.

- que:
  - Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
  ans:
  - What magic have we on our side?

- que:
  - Will you chance a miss?
  ans:
  - Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked.

- que:
  - Can you save her?
  ans:
  - Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves? Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.

- que:
  - In the dark, lad? Why should he do that?
  ans:
  - Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.

- que:
  - Mean you to seek him out below?
  ans:
  - I'm not afraid of the dark.

- que:
  - Did you bring me here to sup?
  ans:
  - Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.

- que:
  - What weapon?
  ans:
  - Sunlight.

- que:
  - Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
  ans:
  - Easier than that, Jack. Screwball! Fetch me down a couple of them plates.

- que:
  - Will you explain what's going on?
  ans:
  - Patience, lad.

- que:
  - She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
  ans:
  - She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted. Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...

- que:
  - The quest's at an end and where's the good of it? A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
  ans:
  - I was with the Princess.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - By the pond. She was teasing me.

- que:
  - And did you?
  ans:
  - Nay. It was lost. When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.

- que:
  - How're these?
  ans:
  - They'll do nicely.

- que:
  - These for me?
  ans:
  - If you like.

- que:
  - Unicorn?
  ans:
  - A promise is a sacred oath.

- que:
  - Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper?
  ans:
  - I detest serpents.

- que:
  - What shall we do?
  ans:
  - Be patient.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - I've lost my napkin. It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.

- que:
  - Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one? It would thrill me so.
  ans:
  - How much longer?

- que:
  - Tis a fair question. If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
  ans:
  - Are you honest?

- que:
  - He'll not flee if I show myself?
  ans:
  - Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - To fetch your napkin.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know. They've hurt the unicorn.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - My father and the Baron.

- que:
  - How bad was the unicorn's wound?
  ans:
  - It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away.

- que:
  - He did run?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, and the mare with him.

- que:
  - Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
  ans:
  - Not even the birds sing sweet as you.

- que:
  - If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...? Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
  ans:
  - My lady mocks me.

- que:
  - Let it. Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
  ans:
  - Tis not fit for a princess.

- que:
  - Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
  ans:
  - I have no wife.

- que:
  - Jack... Forgive me...
  ans:
  - Do you wish it, Jack? Wish you this our wedding band?

- que:
  - What have I done?
  ans:
  - Only what's right...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sunlight... It destroys him.

- que:
  - Sunlight?
  ans:
  - That's why he goes masked during the day...

- que:
  - Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
  ans:
  - Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Ouch! Something's biting me.

- que:
  - Oona? Do you suppose it's a faerie?
  ans:
  - Ow! Whatever it is, it hurts.

- que:
  - Grand champion, is it? And what great cause leads you to me?
  ans:
  - We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir. He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.

- que:
  - What's this now?
  ans:
  - I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.

- que:
  - Well spoke, boy. You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
  ans:
  - They call me Green Jack, ma'am.

- que:
  - Think me fair, do you, Jack?
  ans:
  - The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...

- que:
  - Where do I find the Baron's castle?
  ans:
  - Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...

- que:
  - What became of the princess?
  ans:
  - Princess? I know of no princess.

- que:
  - Is she fair, this princess?
  ans:
  - Exceeding fair.

- que:
  - As fair as me?
  ans:
  - Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.

- que:
  - You'll visit again?
  ans:
  - As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.

- que:
  - I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk. Mayn't I come visit sometime?
  ans:
  - I'd be honored.

- que:
  - Only that?
  ans:
  - And charmed, of course.

- que:
  - Do I not please you, Jack?
  ans:
  - In every way.

- que:
  - And am I not fair?
  ans:
  - Wondrously so.

- que:
  - Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
  ans:
  - That was in jest.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.

- que:
  - And sweet?
  ans:
  - True north... Straight up that pass, through the net.

- que:
  - What do we do now?
  ans:
  - We wait.

- que:
  - What's she doing?
  ans:
  - I think she's about to foal.

- que:
  - Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
  ans:
  - Where?

- que:
  - What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
  ans:
  - His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.

- que:
  - What care the bones when the soul is free?
  ans:
  - Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets.

- que:
  - Done like a champion. Can you reach me with the line?
  ans:
  - Sorry, Jack.

- que:
  - No speeches! What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
  ans:
  - Oh, but I have.

- que:
  - How came you by this blade?
  ans:
  - I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.

- que:
  - Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...

- que:
  - Lost?
  ans:
  - Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...

- que:
  - Simple as that, eh?
  ans:
  - Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...

- que:
  - To Castle Couer de Noir?
  ans:
  - There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there. Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.

- que:
  - You've been inside?
  ans:
  - I guess it depends on what you give up on.

- que:
  - When does George get to come see his house?
  ans:
  - It's so beautiful.

- que:
  - What's that for?
  ans:
  - Mom said I should.

- que:
  - What color?
  ans:
  - Red.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - I couldn't get it to go down.

- que:
  - And why was the alarm on?
  ans:
  - I couldn't sleep last night.

- que:
  - Why? What do you mean?
  ans:
  - Uh...using Josh like that.

- que:
  - Has he eaten anything at all?
  ans:
  - I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.

- que:
  - Who are all these people?
  ans:
  - Sorry I got you into trouble.

- que:
  - Are you his friend?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.

- que:
  - Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
  ans:
  - I'm living here while I build another house.

- que:
  - Don't you have school?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - What's today?
  ans:
  - Monday.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - I had them in my pocket.

- que:
  - Can you keep Sam straight?
  ans:
  - He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me.

- que:
  - I mean drugs. I thought you said he was?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.

- que:
  - Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that?
  ans:
  - My mother would die.

- que:
  - What did you think it would be?
  ans:
  - I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam.

- que:
  - I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - They're trying to make me spend the summer here. I'm leaving in the morning.

- que:
  - Where to?
  ans:
  - I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.

- que:
  - Your dad's really gonna build his house?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where's your dad?
  ans:
  - He jumped into the ocean.

- que:
  - Do you remember me from when you lived here?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I wanted him to marry her.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Turn over.

- que:
  - Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride? Maybe see a movie?
  ans:
  - No thanks.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I can use your mom's.

- que:
  - Not really. No. Kinda. He got busted?
  ans:
  - His parents took his car. They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.

- que:
  - Why are you so uptight?
  ans:
  - I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means.

- que:
  - Does everything have to have a point?
  ans:
  - It's freakish. I don't get it. I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Josh said...

- que:
  - You're driving me crazy! Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay. I guess.

- que:
  - Are you afraid of heights?
  ans:
  - Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You hate your father.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.

- que:
  - Why is that?
  ans:
  - Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.

- que:
  - Will he talk to me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Are you guys' friends?
  ans:
  - We've known each other since grade school.

- que:
  - I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't want you as a friend.

- que:
  - Mr. Stevens?
  ans:
  - I've been dreading you.

- que:
  - A violation?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - And if I enclosed it?
  ans:
  - An exhaust system or a window is code.

- que:
  - A sink?
  ans:
  - Allowed outside the enclosed area.

- que:
  - I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
  ans:
  - If that's what it takes.

- que:
  - how much weight have you lost?
  ans:
  - Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry.

- que:
  - How's your wife?
  ans:
  - When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry. Now she's just hostile.

- que:
  - Right...she married...what was he?
  ans:
  - He buys and sells the world.

- que:
  - Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
  ans:
  - This isn't me. We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer. But you won't change.

- que:
  - Maybe...?
  ans:
  - That's too long.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - Forty.

- que:
  - We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley?
  ans:
  - Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there.

- que:
  - What can I do for you, George?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Is Alyssa home?
  ans:
  - She's out with a friend.

- que:
  - Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
  ans:
  - She didn't really say.

- que:
  - Sam?
  ans:
  - Uh huh.

- que:
  - It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
  ans:
  - Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa.

- que:
  - Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
  ans:
  - There are no windows facing my...exposure.

- que:
  - Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
  ans:
  - And you thought they might be under her dress?

- que:
  - To check up on me?
  ans:
  - I'll be around to check up on you.

- que:
  - Why would you be there?
  ans:
  - Because I live there.

- que:
  - Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It bugs me.

- que:
  - You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out?
  ans:
  - Your brothers are right. It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.

- que:
  - Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - When are you going to be back?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - A friend of yours is here.

- que:
  - Did you got through my pants?
  ans:
  - I might have a solution.

- que:
  - I know. Why?
  ans:
  - I like how it feels not to feel.

- que:
  - What would you like to be?
  ans:
  - What I'm not.

- que:
  - What are you now?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What do you know about me?
  ans:
  - He's got nothing to do with me.

- que:
  - What would you be doing now?
  ans:
  - Getting high, I guess.

- que:
  - If I asked you to stop, would you?
  ans:
  - I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.

- que:
  - Sun glasses?
  ans:
  - To hide a black eye.

- que:
  - Why wouldn't she leave?
  ans:
  - I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.

- que:
  - Do you ever wish you had done it?
  ans:
  - I loved him too much.

- que:
  - After everything he did to you and your mom?
  ans:
  - After everything.

- que:
  - Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. Have him put it on a separate line. At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.

- que:
  - I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
  ans:
  - The kind where there isn't really an answer.

- que:
  - I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
  ans:
  - The kind where there isn't really an answer.

- que:
  - And you told Mom today?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What would you do?
  ans:
  - I'd build a house.

- que:
  - Can you build a house in four months?
  ans:
  - I can die trying.

- que:
  - I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave?
  ans:
  - It's my day off. I thought I'd help with the plumbing.

- que:
  - Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
  ans:
  - I don't let him. He just loves to.

- que:
  - How many bedrooms will your house have?
  ans:
  - Three.

- que:
  - I just wanted to know where Mom was?
  ans:
  - Oh. Sorry.

- que:
  - Because Dad left?
  ans:
  - She's a little sad, is all.

- que:
  - You let him pierce his nose?
  ans:
  - Lock the door behind you.

- que:
  - Where is he?
  ans:
  - Where he always is.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - He doesn't answer.

- que:
  - You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
  ans:
  - Why does he have a lock on his door?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect.

- que:
  - What did you do with your dog?
  ans:
  - Kurt's been feeding him.

- que:
  - But you can't call me while you think?
  ans:
  - I wasn't thinking. Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.

- que:
  - Why would they tow your truck?
  ans:
  - I was parked in day parking.

- que:
  - Why call me?
  ans:
  - I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.

- que:
  - Money?
  ans:
  - Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.

- que:
  - Where will you live?
  ans:
  - The garage.

- que:
  - When's school over?
  ans:
  - Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.

- que:
  - You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
  ans:
  - The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive.

- que:
  - Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
  ans:
  - No. I was going to let you do that.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I used to live here.

- que:
  - Which?
  ans:
  - The first and the last.

- que:
  - I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
  ans:
  - Sam's favorite.

- que:
  - Do you remember?
  ans:
  - The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I'm fine. Nothing. I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.

- que:
  - Finished or unfinished?
  ans:
  - It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real.

- que:
  - Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
  ans:
  - That wasn't a dream. That was Sam.

- que:
  - With your hands or your tongue?
  ans:
  - You're not well.

- que:
  - Where's Sam?
  ans:
  - He won't use my shower. I don't get it.

- que:
  - You brought your kids?
  ans:
  - I'll find something that won't kill them.

- que:
  - Do you need help?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - I can hire workers to help me.
  ans:
  - How much time do they get to spend with their dad?

- que:
  - Going on?
  ans:
  - When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.

- que:
  - That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that?
  ans:
  - That was the truth.

- que:
  - Let's not do this, okay?
  ans:
  - I need to know.

- que:
  - Is your back still killing you?
  ans:
  - I didn't think you'd come today.

- que:
  - Back. Neck. Back.
  ans:
  - Left you?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I could die.

- que:
  - Are you going to kiss me?
  ans:
  - It's not my back that's killing me.

- que:
  - Been thinking?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Does Alyssa know?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What's your deal with Alyssa?
  ans:
  - Don't even...I'm there.

- que:
  - What the fuck?
  ans:
  - Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said.

- que:
  - Then you tell me, what just happened?
  ans:
  - The payoff.

- que:
  - Should I?
  ans:
  - It would worry me.

- que:
  - What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
  ans:
  - I'd be you.

- que:
  - To shave your chest?
  ans:
  - We should take a vacation.

- que:
  - Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
  ans:
  - I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is.

- que:
  - You can't go with me because of Sam?
  ans:
  - Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that.

- que:
  - So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it?
  ans:
  - I was talking about our marriage.

- que:
  - What are you doing home?
  ans:
  - I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.

- que:
  - Where are the kids?
  ans:
  - Sam took them to a movie.

- que:
  - Are you wearing eye shadow?
  ans:
  - You don't look like you.

- que:
  - Do you like red?
  ans:
  - Hey.

- que:
  - You got a dog?
  ans:
  - It's not ours. It's George's.

- que:
  - Do you know anything about building a house?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you doing in my room?
  ans:
  - I didn't go in your room.

- que:
  - Can you stay for dinner?
  ans:
  - Depends on what I'd give up on.

- que:
  - You're sure about this?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You could keep it and rent it out?
  ans:
  - This is what he wants.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He'll be gone for his birthday.

- que:
  - What did you say?
  ans:
  - Dad said it first.

- que:
  - Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
  ans:
  - I just thought it would be nice.

- que:
  - All day again?
  ans:
  - Not all day. I'll be home after lunch.

- que:
  - Can we really help build a house?
  ans:
  - I brought a few of my own.

- que:
  - Go tell your father we're eating.
  ans:
  - Nothing R, okay?

- que:
  - Dad's home, already?
  ans:
  - In the bedroom.

- que:
  - Nagger?
  ans:
  - No, nigger.

- que:
  - A night in the hole?
  ans:
  - Better make it a week.

- que:
  - Is Mae Rose okay?
  ans:
  - She's doing just fine.

- que:
  - And the baby?
  ans:
  - He's a big one.

- que:
  - Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
  ans:
  - Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.

- que:
  - You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
  ans:
  - Crawford's are always looking for new talent.

- que:
  - Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
  ans:
  - Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.

- que:
  - I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
  ans:
  - Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...

- que:
  - At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.

- que:
  - Is Spanky here?
  ans:
  - No, but...

- que:
  - Then what's the problem?
  ans:
  - Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.

- que:
  - Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
  ans:
  - Sharp.

- que:
  - She's alright, isn't she?
  ans:
  - Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - She got married last month.

- que:
  - Married?
  ans:
  - Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.

- que:
  - Take care of me?
  ans:
  - You know, go to the tonk or whatever.

- que:
  - Want me to come back some other time?
  ans:
  - Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.

- que:
  - You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.

- que:
  - Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
  ans:
  - You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.

- que:
  - Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
  ans:
  - As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.

- que:
  - Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line. What's wrong, baby?
  ans:
  - Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.

- que:
  - Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
  ans:
  - Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.

- que:
  - Can't you remember your own name?
  ans:
  - I know it begins with a \"C\"...

- que:
  - You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
  ans:
  - Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.

- que:
  - Don't I know you?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Sure I do. What's your name again?
  ans:
  - Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.

- que:
  - You went to Monroe?
  ans:
  - That's right! Good old Monroe...

- que:
  - Where they taking us, anyway?
  ans:
  - Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.

- que:
  - What are they gonna do to us?
  ans:
  - You? Dine and ditch, right? Over ten bucks? You're probably looking at a thumb.

- que:
  - A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks? That include the tip?
  ans:
  - Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.

- que:
  - Start your job? What kind of job?
  ans:
  - That's some long green.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Why didn't you take it?
  ans:
  - The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.

- que:
  - A loan officer?
  ans:
  - That's right, a loan officer.

- que:
  - So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - How would I get a loan, anyway?
  ans:
  - You need collateral.

- que:
  - That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
  ans:
  - My daddy gave me this watch.

- que:
  - Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
  ans:
  - Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!

- que:
  - You mean this sign? The one that says \"No Coloreds Allowed.\" That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
  ans:
  - Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - I said you're soft.

- que:
  - Alright. You want some pie?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I want some pie.

- que:
  - Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
  ans:
  - Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?

- que:
  - Reward?
  ans:
  - Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.

- que:
  - Still got that ten dollars?
  ans:
  - Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.

- que:
  - That jelly you were talking to right here?
  ans:
  - So you made a generous contribution.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.

- que:
  - You lost all our money in a card game?
  ans:
  - He even got my daddy's watch.

- que:
  - Fuck that cheap-ass watch -- I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
  ans:
  - It ain't here.

- que:
  - I wouldn't do that if I was you.
  ans:
  - What ain't there?

- que:
  - Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
  ans:
  - Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - He does it all by himself.

- que:
  - What about you, Radio?
  ans:
  - Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.

- que:
  - He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit. How 'bout him down there?
  ans:
  - No, man. I want you to have it.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm saying.

- que:
  - What does that mean?
  ans:
  - Forget it.

- que:
  - What's up, Ray?
  ans:
  - Claude.

- que:
  - What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
  ans:
  - Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. The map is very clear.

- que:
  - You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
  ans:
  - Cookie didn't draw it. I did.

- que:
  - Say what?
  ans:
  - That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.

- que:
  - The hell you talking about? What train?
  ans:
  - We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.

- que:
  - I don't know. Who do you want?
  ans:
  - Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.

- que:
  - You get ketchup?
  ans:
  - Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.

- que:
  - What am I gonna eat?
  ans:
  - You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.

- que:
  - You want to hit? Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
  ans:
  - Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?

- que:
  - Him?
  ans:
  - Can't be worse than any of these other fools.

- que:
  - So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
  ans:
  - What about us? Don't forget to mention us.

- que:
  - Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
  ans:
  - I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.

- que:
  - You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
  ans:
  - He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.

- que:
  - Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
  ans:
  - I'm not working on a plan.

- que:
  - What the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - Don't touch that car.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - I said you're soft.

- que:
  - Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
  ans:
  - He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.

- que:
  - Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.

- que:
  - Why the hell not?
  ans:
  - I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.

- que:
  - You didn't get ketchup?
  ans:
  - Gimme that damn thing.

- que:
  - Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
  ans:
  - Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - They're touching.

- que:
  - Yeah? You and what army?
  ans:
  - Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.

- que:
  - How you doin'?
  ans:
  - I'm all right.

- que:
  - You ever done time before?
  ans:
  - You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.

- que:
  - Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
  ans:
  - Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.

- que:
  - Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
  ans:
  - Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.

- que:
  - You got your own nightclub?
  ans:
  - Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.

- que:
  - Why ain't that pick swinging?
  ans:
  - Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.

- que:
  - Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
  ans:
  - Judge gave 'em the long ride.

- que:
  - You mean Louis Armstrong?
  ans:
  - He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.

- que:
  - Where am I at, man?
  ans:
  - C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.

- que:
  - Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
  ans:
  - That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.

- que:
  - Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story. Nigger, you crying?
  ans:
  - Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.

- que:
  - What do you think about that?
  ans:
  - I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.

- que:
  - What were they, bootleggers?
  ans:
  - Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.

- que:
  - What are you doing here, mama?
  ans:
  - Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.

- que:
  - Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
  ans:
  - He must still be in there.

- que:
  - Lemonade?
  ans:
  - I prefer bourbon.

- que:
  - What's going on here?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.

- que:
  - Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
  ans:
  - Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.

- que:
  - Are you offering me a bribe?
  ans:
  - I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.

- que:
  - Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
  ans:
  - Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.

- que:
  - Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
  ans:
  - Something like that, yes.

- que:
  - She give you that scar, too?
  ans:
  - I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.

- que:
  - Like you shot Winston Hancock?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.

- que:
  - Jenny?
  ans:
  - No, it says Marleen here.

- que:
  - Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
  ans:
  - They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Satchmo.

- que:
  - Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
  ans:
  - Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.

- que:
  - You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
  ans:
  - That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Me? Willie Long.

- que:
  - What are you in for, Willie?
  ans:
  - That's a long story...

- que:
  - You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
  ans:
  - They run but they never get too far.

- que:
  - What's the Boom Boom Room?
  ans:
  - That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.

- que:
  - Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.

- que:
  - Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
  ans:
  - That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.

- que:
  - Blacks welcome there?
  ans:
  - Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.

- que:
  - What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
  ans:
  - Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.

- que:
  - Where'd you get this?
  ans:
  - I'm interested. Keep talking.

- que:
  - He's sick?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.

- que:
  - Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
  ans:
  - Little Nicky.

- que:
  - Is this a joke?
  ans:
  - No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.

- que:
  - Now will you get in the flask?
  ans:
  - We could create our own hell there.

- que:
  - You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
  ans:
  - Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...

- que:
  - Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
  ans:
  - I lowered the drinking age to ten.

- que:
  - Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
  ans:
  - Noon...

- que:
  - It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
  ans:
  - Weed lowers the body temperature. I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.

- que:
  - Uh. No it won't?
  ans:
  - Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...

- que:
  - She goes to Parson's, right?
  ans:
  - I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.

- que:
  - Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
  ans:
  - My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.

- que:
  - My mom wasn't a goat?
  ans:
  - Try an angel.

- que:
  - An angel?
  ans:
  - Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.

- que:
  - Wow. What... what did she look like?
  ans:
  - Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.

- que:
  - How come you're not older?
  ans:
  - Angels don't get any older, son.

- que:
  - Where did you meet my father?
  ans:
  - It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.

- que:
  - How did you see me?
  ans:
  - We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.

- que:
  - Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
  ans:
  - It would be so okay.

- que:
  - What's Nicky doing down there?
  ans:
  - Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.

- que:
  - Did you just talk?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - That turn you on there, RuPaul?
  ans:
  - My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.

- que:
  - So far, so good. Now what?
  ans:
  - Put it in your mouth.

- que:
  - Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
  ans:
  - Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

- que:
  - What can I do about it?
  ans:
  - You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.

- que:
  - Release the evil?
  ans:
  - Everything's fine, pop.

- que:
  - Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
  ans:
  - Sure, pop. Whatever you want.

- que:
  - Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
  ans:
  - Now everybody sit down.

- que:
  - Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
  ans:
  - Metallica, Dad. Come on.

- que:
  - How bad?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.

- que:
  - Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
  ans:
  - No. This can't be happening.

- que:
  - Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
  ans:
  - What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...

- que:
  - You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
  ans:
  - Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?

- que:
  - What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
  ans:
  - Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.

- que:
  - I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
  ans:
  - Coulda been much worse.

- que:
  - You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
  ans:
  - You got it.

- que:
  - Bus?
  ans:
  - Beast.

- que:
  - You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
  ans:
  - I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...

- que:
  - DEMON I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
  ans:
  - We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?

- que:
  - DEMON You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
  ans:
  - You're not saying it's up to me?

- que:
  - DEMON You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
  ans:
  - I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.

- que:
  - By she, do you mean he?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's with that guy?
  ans:
  - Gotta be one of his disciples or something.

- que:
  - Should we wake him up?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You do it.

- que:
  - Did you check out the dragon mouth?
  ans:
  - The Dark Prince is here.

- que:
  - You sure you're down with this?
  ans:
  - Little nervous. Wanna puke.

- que:
  - Which way did he go?
  ans:
  - That way.

- que:
  - What's Ozzy trying to say there?
  ans:
  - Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.

- que:
  - You followed him?
  ans:
  - I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.

- que:
  - You keep a bat under your seat?
  ans:
  - Yes, great movie...

- que:
  - Dude. Seriously?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.

- que:
  - It's \"Comptoir Sud Pacific.\" Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
  ans:
  - No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

- que:
  - Adrian?
  ans:
  - Andrew.

- que:
  - Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
  ans:
  - That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
  ans:
  - The South.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.

- que:
  - Why are you laughing?
  ans:
  - I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.

- que:
  - Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
  ans:
  - If you want to.

- que:
  - This town is really going to hell lately. So what part of the city do you live in?
  ans:
  - I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.

- que:
  - You have a dog? What kind?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.

- que:
  - School?
  ans:
  - Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.

- que:
  - Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
  ans:
  - Sometimes, sure.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

- que:
  - What was that?
  ans:
  - I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...

- que:
  - What were you thinking coming here?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.

- que:
  - Are you dead?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I think I'm floating.

- que:
  - Why would you be floating?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - Can we go fly over Central Park?
  ans:
  - Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.

- que:
  - We're going to Jersey?
  ans:
  - From my dad's side of the family.

- que:
  - Yes. What is rent?
  ans:
  - Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.

- que:
  - It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
  ans:
  - Yeah. The deep South.

- que:
  - Why is that funny?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - A black guy?
  ans:
  - If it's Cassius, yes.

- que:
  - Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
  ans:
  - That just hurt a lot.

- que:
  - I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
  ans:
  - Hey...

- que:
  - See something you like, my man?
  ans:
  - Yes. I would like my flask back.

- que:
  - You callin' me a thief, my man?
  ans:
  - No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.

- que:
  - All right -- what are you?
  ans:
  - Your turn.

- que:
  - We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
  ans:
  - Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

- que:
  - Where do you send them?
  ans:
  - You're a beautiful pair.

- que:
  - That's better. How do you want us?
  ans:
  - Nude. Imagine, a pair.

- que:
  - How do you want us?
  ans:
  - Up there.

- que:
  - How did they get in here?
  ans:
  - Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.

- que:
  - What other food?
  ans:
  - It's a real privilege, Sandman.

- que:
  - Your own work?
  ans:
  - And I did it myself right on there.

- que:
  - I designed it myself. What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
  ans:
  - Just the face.

- que:
  - Do you have anything special in mind?
  ans:
  - I don't care... Just get it over with.

- que:
  - Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
  ans:
  - You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?

- que:
  - Had enough?
  ans:
  - Even the alarm didn't wake him.

- que:
  - Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
  ans:
  - Not in my time...

- que:
  - Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
  ans:
  - Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.

- que:
  - I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
  ans:
  - Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.

- que:
  - Who invited you?
  ans:
  - I'm in my party mood.

- que:
  - Yes. But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
  ans:
  - I just might look in on New You 483 myself.

- que:
  - Did you ever see anybody renew?
  ans:
  - I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.

- que:
  - Did you?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Anybody we know?
  ans:
  - Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - I'm Mary 2.

- que:
  - Where do you live, Mary?
  ans:
  - Here.

- que:
  - Why aren't you in Nursery?
  ans:
  - I'm very smart.

- que:
  - When do you go up?
  ans:
  - I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.

- que:
  - What's wrong, Available?
  ans:
  - Please... No.

- que:
  - You prefer women?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Well then...?
  ans:
  - Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.

- que:
  - Sad? What made you sad?
  ans:
  - A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.

- que:
  - Yes... probably he was renewed?
  ans:
  - He was killed.

- que:
  - Killed? Why do you use that word?
  ans:
  - Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.

- que:
  - I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners. Who brought you?
  ans:
  - Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.

- que:
  - You felt sad. What's your name?
  ans:
  - Jessica.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - I changed my mind.

- que:
  - And now?
  ans:
  - Curious.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - How a Sandman lives.

- que:
  - I suppose. But what if you want to live?
  ans:
  - So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.

- que:
  - Are you a 5 or a 6?
  ans:
  - Six. I go red next year.

- que:
  - What Quad do you live in?
  ans:
  - K.

- que:
  - You're sure you don't want to try?
  ans:
  - You could have called me yourself.

- que:
  - Here I am. Shall I come in?
  ans:
  - I couldn't get you out of my mind.

- que:
  - I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
  ans:
  - Maybe... sure...

- que:
  - You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
  ans:
  - You know.

- que:
  - Why show me?
  ans:
  - I'm going to run.

- que:
  - Why tell me?
  ans:
  - You know something.

- que:
  - About running, dying what?
  ans:
  - Both... running's what I'm interested in.

- que:
  - Where did you get that?
  ans:
  - A Runner gave it to me.

- que:
  - And then you killed him, right?
  ans:
  - I let him go... believe me.

- que:
  - Please? What friends?
  ans:
  - I don't have much time.

- que:
  - What're you going to do?
  ans:
  - That's tomorrow.

- que:
  - We're coming to Arcade. Shall we Relive together?
  ans:
  - A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.

- que:
  - You're not going, are you?
  ans:
  - Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.

- que:
  - I'm only telling you what I've heard... Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
  ans:
  - Uh-uh.

- que:
  - Let's see -- how long has it been?
  ans:
  - Just follow -- no matter how it seems...

- que:
  - I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
  ans:
  - But what is this -- why?

- que:
  - Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
  ans:
  - Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

- que:
  - Because he's my friend -- and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
  ans:
  - Are you taking me to them?

- que:
  - He's good, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now...

- que:
  - How will they know we're coming?
  ans:
  - They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.

- que:
  - Will you take me with you?
  ans:
  - Why, Jessica? You're still a green.

- que:
  - How do we know this is the right way?
  ans:
  - It's the only way.

- que:
  - What do you suppose this was...?
  ans:
  - Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything... ...to eat, of course.

- que:
  - I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- Are you glad you didn't kill him?
  ans:
  - It doesn't make any difference anymore.

- que:
  - I wanted to... ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
  ans:
  - I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.

- que:
  - Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
  ans:
  - I doubt it.

- que:
  - Do you think he was telling the Truth?
  ans:
  - Maybe we're the first ones to get through... Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.

- que:
  - What does it mean?
  ans:
  - The Lifeclocks have no power outside.

- que:
  - You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
  ans:
  - You know, Jessica.

- que:
  - ...But I still have the choice...?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Look at his face... and his hair... Is that what it is to grow old?
  ans:
  - It could be...

- que:
  - That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
  ans:
  - He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.

- que:
  - You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
  ans:
  - I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.

- que:
  - And Sanctuary?
  ans:
  - Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...

- que:
  - What does that water do?
  ans:
  - It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.

- que:
  - Is it inside the city?
  ans:
  - Of course. I don't know where... I just took them for granted. It's our only chance.

- que:
  - And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
  ans:
  - Yes...

- que:
  - What kind of jewel is this?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
  ans:
  - All this. All of it.

- que:
  - What people?
  ans:
  - I don't know... but it does.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Goodbye.

- que:
  - Do you want to see Doc?
  ans:
  - We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.

- que:
  - A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
  ans:
  - I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.

- que:
  - My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
  ans:
  - No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.

- que:
  - How long have you been living here?
  ans:
  - For as long as I can remember.

- que:
  - How did you get here?
  ans:
  - I have always been here...

- que:
  - Are there any other humans?
  ans:
  - Gracious... no.

- que:
  - Have any other people ever passed through?
  ans:
  - But there may be a few around somewhere.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - Dead... they're dead... and buried.

- que:
  - They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
  ans:
  - No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.

- que:
  - Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
  ans:
  - Never, never, ever. Nothing.

- que:
  - Are you ready to put him in?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
  ans:
  - More... many more.

- que:
  - Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
  ans:
  - I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.

- que:
  - Stay? They lived together all their years?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes... I think...

- que:
  - Can you make it back?
  ans:
  - Oh my... I'll try.

- que:
  - Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
  ans:
  - Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.

- que:
  - Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
  ans:
  - Too little.

- que:
  - You're not contagious are you?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Good... You up for a drive?
  ans:
  - Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.

- que:
  - Sure, what's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - Texaco... What's wrong with that?
  ans:
  - Listen.

- que:
  - You want somethin'?
  ans:
  - No, I'm okay.

- que:
  - What's happenin'?
  ans:
  - They're comin' with us.

- que:
  - Pete... You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I'm, okay... You okay?
  ans:
  - Sure, I'm okay.

- que:
  - Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
  ans:
  - This is our bedroom.

- que:
  - You're a musician?
  ans:
  - Yes, I thought my wife...

- que:
  - What do you mean by that?
  ans:
  - How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.

- que:
  - What is?
  ans:
  - The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.

- que:
  - Do you own a video camera?
  ans:
  - No. Fred hates them.

- que:
  - Maid? Relative?
  ans:
  - No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.

- que:
  - How'd the camera get so high like that?
  ans:
  - And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.

- que:
  - Or not so recently?
  ans:
  - Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.

- que:
  - You recognize that guy?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Laurent.

- que:
  - His or ours?
  ans:
  - Ours, Ed.

- que:
  - What's that, Ed?
  ans:
  - There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

- que:
  - How would you like to take me to dinner?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Can I call you?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.

- que:
  - Pete?
  ans:
  - Me, too.

- que:
  - Are you positive he knows?
  ans:
  - I'm not positive... but... he knows.

- que:
  - So what do we do?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Have you partied with him?
  ans:
  - I used to.

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  - No, honey... It was part of the deal.

- que:
  - What deal?
  ans:
  - He works for Mr. Eddy.

- que:
  - What's he do?
  ans:
  - He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

- que:
  - How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
  ans:
  - Pete... Don't...

- que:
  - How'd it happen, Alice?
  ans:
  - It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...

- que:
  - In pornos?
  ans:
  - No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.

- que:
  - Andy?
  ans:
  - That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.

- que:
  - Why are ya goin' so early?
  ans:
  - Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.

- que:
  - What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
  ans:
  - Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.

- que:
  - What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
  ans:
  - I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else... To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...

- que:
  - Are you my man?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
  ans:
  - You got him.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - We killed him.

- que:
  - Alice?
  ans:
  - Alice...

- que:
  - Where's the bathroom?
  ans:
  - Up the stairs - down the hall.

- que:
  - Andy, who is that guy?
  ans:
  - I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.

- que:
  - Dick Laurent?
  ans:
  - Yes, I believe so.

- que:
  - He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
  ans:
  - I don't. I don't know him.

- que:
  - Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
  ans:
  - Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.

- que:
  - Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
  ans:
  - Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.

- que:
  - What night is that?
  ans:
  - The night before you showed up in the slammer...

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - Sit down.

- que:
  - I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
  ans:
  - The police called us.

- que:
  - Yeah? what did they want?
  ans:
  - They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.

- que:
  - Sheila?
  ans:
  - Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.

- que:
  - Did you tell the police this?
  ans:
  - We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.

- que:
  - What happened to me?
  ans:
  - Please tell me.

- que:
  - The wife killer?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - His condition? What do you mean?
  ans:
  - His physical condition.

- que:
  - Have you made any charges against him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Where's Pete?
  ans:
  - Out in back.

- que:
  - You talk to him?
  ans:
  - No... Here he comes.

- que:
  - Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
  ans:
  - I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.

- que:
  - Where is he now?
  ans:
  - He's in the infirmary, being examined.

- que:
  - Did you ask him who he is?
  ans:
  - He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.

- que:
  - If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
  ans:
  - I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.

- que:
  - How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
  ans:
  - Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.

- que:
  - You just gonna let him go?
  ans:
  - We'll get a tail put on him.

- que:
  - Now, Mack, what's the situation?
  ans:
  - I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.

- que:
  - That's not Fred Madison?
  ans:
  - No, sir, it's not.

- que:
  - Yeah, Mack?
  ans:
  - Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.

- que:
  - You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
  ans:
  - When he went to work, right.

- que:
  - What about yesterday?
  ans:
  - He didn't come home.

- que:
  - Pete, what happened to you?
  ans:
  - No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothin'.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - He won't give his name.

- que:
  - What is this, Rogoff?
  ans:
  - I don't know yet.

- que:
  - Who is this man?
  ans:
  - He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.

- que:
  - He's not Madison?
  ans:
  - Not even close.

- que:
  - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  ans:
  - I... I didn't say anything...

- que:
  - DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - There's no other bedroom?
  ans:
  - No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.

- que:
  - What's your axe?
  ans:
  - Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...

- que:
  - Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
  ans:
  - The first night... Not the last two.

- que:
  - Something wrong?
  ans:
  - My... My head.

- que:
  - What's bothering you, Madison?
  ans:
  - The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.

- que:
  - No, no I don't. Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.

- que:
  - What do you mean? You're where right now?
  ans:
  - At your house.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I thought I'd stay home and read.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - A videotape.

- que:
  - Who's it from?
  ans:
  - I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.

- que:
  - Does it say anything on the tape?
  ans:
  - No, nothing.

- que:
  - Good book, huh?
  ans:
  - Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.

- que:
  - What night?
  ans:
  - When you didn't come to the club.

- que:
  - Called? When?
  ans:
  - From the club. You didn't answer.

- que:
  - I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
  ans:
  - You were asleep when I got home, yes.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.

- que:
  - What's that? Another tape?
  ans:
  - Yes, I just found it on the step.

- que:
  - Don't you want to watch it?
  ans:
  - I guess so.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - On the tape! There was something else on the tape.

- que:
  - Where would you feel safe?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Maybe a hotel.

- que:
  - I thought you were getting me a drink?
  ans:
  - Just a minute.

- que:
  - What job?
  ans:
  - I thought there might be somebody inside.

- que:
  - Was there?
  ans:
  - No... of course not.

- que:
  - Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
  ans:
  - How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.

- que:
  - Which would you choose?
  ans:
  - Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.

- que:
  - Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
  ans:
  - The heart, I guess.

- que:
  - What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
  ans:
  - I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.

- que:
  - At sixty?
  ans:
  - Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.

- que:
  - Pornos?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Give ya a boner.

- que:
  - Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
  ans:
  - If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.

- que:
  - How ya doin', Pete?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.

- que:
  - Who is this?
  ans:
  - You know who it is.

- que:
  - Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - At your house. Don't you remember?
  ans:
  - No. No, I don't.

- que:
  - What's goin' on?
  ans:
  - I missed you.

- que:
  - What are you guys doin'?
  ans:
  - Guess we're goin' over to the \"Ten Pin\".

- que:
  - You want some company?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Why haven't you called me?
  ans:
  - Sorry... I...

- que:
  - What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What night?
  ans:
  - Last time I saw you.

- que:
  - I don't remember... What happened that night?
  ans:
  - You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.

- que:
  - Whatiya mean?
  ans:
  - You were acting like a different person.

- que:
  - You still care about me?
  ans:
  - Sure. Sure I do.

- que:
  - You really don't remember?
  ans:
  - No... I told you.

- que:
  - Whatiya mean, Sheila?
  ans:
  - I don't want to talk about it...

- que:
  - Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Why don't you like me?
  ans:
  - I do like you, Sheila.

- que:
  - Where'd you come from?
  ans:
  - I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.

- que:
  - I was?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
  ans:
  - Yes. Might as well - all of it.

- que:
  - Not even a radio?
  ans:
  - It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.

- que:
  - What about those men we met this morning?
  ans:
  - Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.

- que:
  - Two years!?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
  ans:
  - Fossils.

- que:
  - Fossils, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm a paleontologist.

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - A paleontologist.

- que:
  - Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
  ans:
  - It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.

- que:
  - Yes, it just shows I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
  ans:
  - Okay, brother.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
  ans:
  - Why, of course. Yes.

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - It certainly is.

- que:
  - Oh, really?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - All right, all right. Keep quiet.
  ans:
  - Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?

- que:
  - Do you think they're cannibals?
  ans:
  - Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.

- que:
  - Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.

- que:
  - No kidding?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
  ans:
  - Have I?

- que:
  - They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
  ans:
  - The police?

- que:
  - Horns?
  ans:
  - Yeah. You know.

- que:
  - Horns? What kind of horns?
  ans:
  - Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.

- que:
  - Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
  ans:
  - Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?

- que:
  - What are we going to do?
  ans:
  - Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.

- que:
  - It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
  ans:
  - I'll say.

- que:
  - Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
  ans:
  - It's unbelievable.

- que:
  - All right.
  ans:
  - Say, what about that gold deal?

- que:
  - I say, will you have a cigarette?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Nothing. Why?
  ans:
  - Why, you look beautiful.

- que:
  - Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
  ans:
  - Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.

- que:
  - Cave, eh? Where?
  ans:
  - Over by that hill.

- que:
  - When are you going to start?
  ans:
  - Right this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.

- que:
  - Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey. She'll stick around too. Is that right?
  ans:
  - And mine's Conway.

- que:
  - Where is your mad pilot?
  ans:
  - He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.

- que:
  - So there are others?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - Who, for instance?
  ans:
  - In time you will meet them all.

- que:
  - By the way, what religion do you follow here?
  ans:
  - We follow many.

- que:
  - You have no disputes over women?
  ans:
  - Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.

- que:
  - Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
  ans:
  - Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.

- que:
  - That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
  ans:
  - Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely ...

- que:
  - buy and sell?
  ans:
  - Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .

- que:
  - He amputated his own leg?
  ans:
  - Well, they didn't actually mean that.

- que:
  - You're startled?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.

- que:
  - One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
  ans:
  - The only one.

- que:
  - And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
  ans:
  - The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.

- que:
  - Well, then he's the man I want to see. Will you come along?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'm afraid it does.

- que:
  - Shall we have another?
  ans:
  - No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.

- que:
  - Charming, isn't she?
  ans:
  - Yes, charming.

- que:
  - Amazing! She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
  ans:
  - Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.

- que:
  - Suppose she should leave it?
  ans:
  - Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.

- que:
  - No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
  ans:
  - Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.

- que:
  - It's weird. Chang, how old are you?
  ans:
  - You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.

- que:
  - What exactly do you mean by \"almost any time now\"?
  ans:
  - Splendid!

- que:
  - I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
  ans:
  - Oh, immediately.

- que:
  - Are you so certain you are away from it?
  ans:
  - As far away as I ever want to be.

- que:
  - Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
  ans:
  - Are you taking me?

- que:
  - Are you the High Lama?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
  ans:
  - Sondra Bizet.

- que:
  - Oh, the girl at the piano?
  ans:
  - Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.

- que:
  - Mine?
  ans:
  - Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La. For I am going to die.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - Do you think this will come in my time?

- que:
  - Hello? Colonel?
  ans:
  - The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.

- que:
  - You?
  ans:
  - Hurray!

- que:
  - Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
  ans:
  - Yes, Bob.

- que:
  - Did you say we saved ninety white people?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - George, what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.

- que:
  - What are these people?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I can't get the dialect.

- que:
  - It looks like it. Smell those fumes?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - See that spot?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's it mean?
  ans:
  - It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.

- que:
  - Hello, George. Cigarette?
  ans:
  - Thanks. I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
  ans:
  - Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.

- que:
  - Did I say \"if\"?
  ans:
  - That's what you said.

- que:
  - Porters?
  ans:
  - Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.

- que:
  - Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.

- que:
  - I don't see that there's anything to say.
  ans:
  - What about the porters?

- que:
  - Why not? What's going to stop me?
  ans:
  - You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.

- que:
  - So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
  ans:
  - I don't need any proof.

- que:
  - Is that all my story meant to you?
  ans:
  - What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.

- que:
  - Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
  ans:
  - George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?

- que:
  - George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
  ans:
  - Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.

- que:
  - Maria?
  ans:
  - Yes, the little Russian girl.

- que:
  - You say the porters are waiting for us?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What about the others?
  ans:
  - I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.

- que:
  - Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
  ans:
  - Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.

- que:
  - Where did you come from?
  ans:
  - I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.

- que:
  - Good.
  ans:
  - Why aren't you registered through our office?

- que:
  - What if he refuses?
  ans:
  - We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.

- que:
  - Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane?
  ans:
  - I guess we're in for it.

- que:
  - In for what?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner. When he lands, we'll find out.

- que:
  - Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us! George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
  ans:
  - You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?

- que:
  - Where are we going? Huh?
  ans:
  - Oh, you mean my pigeons.

- que:
  - Was this your idea?
  ans:
  - Yes. Hold this pigeon.

- que:
  - You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
  ans:
  - That was easy. I read your books.

- que:
  - Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
  ans:
  - I saw a man whose life was empty.

- que:
  - Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
  ans:
  - I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!

- que:
  - I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
  ans:
  - I'm so glad.

- que:
  - Bump?
  ans:
  - When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.

- que:
  - You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
  ans:
  - Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.

- que:
  - Struggling, why?
  ans:
  - Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.

- que:
  - I've thought about it for years. I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave. Am I forgiven for sending for you?
  ans:
  - It would serve you right if you were left behind.

- que:
  - It's Fenner.
  ans:
  - Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?

- que:
  - What do you want him to do?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.

- que:
  - Go? Where?
  ans:
  - Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.

- que:
  - I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
  ans:
  - Hesitated, sir.

- que:
  - So... this door. It's... not an exit... ?
  ans:
  - It's not even a fucking door.

- que:
  - And Goodwill Toward Man?
  ans:
  - No. just peace on Earth.

- que:
  - And if I say yes?
  ans:
  - Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.

- que:
  - What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
  ans:
  - Well... you know, when you say \"normal,\" what, exactly...

- que:
  - Mrs. Edelson?
  ans:
  - Only the damn guy won't know it.

- que:
  - What happens if I say no?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Everybody, listen up, we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware. Be safe. Have a good day. Oh, uh... Cowan?
  ans:
  - All the time, sir.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yes, air. But I'm usually wrong. Sir.

- que:
  - Which do you have your money on, Dee?
  ans:
  - I'd go with number three.

- que:
  - Three, huh? Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four? Huh? No?
  ans:
  - I wasn't scared...

- que:
  - Helluva night, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yup. Sure is.

- que:
  - Home? You gotta be kidding me. Black?
  ans:
  - Dee. God damn it. I told you to go home.

- que:
  - What? Who the hell are you?
  ans:
  - INS, Washington. Special services.

- que:
  - Why? What are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - Actually that's a very good question. The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You heard me. You two, especially.

- que:
  - So what's the problem?
  ans:
  - It's the way we do it. The way we've always done it.

- que:
  - What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
  ans:
  - I taught kindergarten.

- que:
  - Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
  ans:
  - Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD. Jay winces.

- que:
  - If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.

- que:
  - Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
  ans:
  - I guess it's simple, huh? They're either gone... or dead.

- que:
  - Now what?
  ans:
  - A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.

- que:
  - Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
  ans:
  - Hold it.

- que:
  - Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
  ans:
  - I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Looks like a train ticket.

- que:
  - What's going on, Kay?
  ans:
  - I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.

- que:
  - The radio show?
  ans:
  - No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.

- que:
  - You think that's what's-happening?
  ans:
  - I think that's what's happening...

- que:
  - That's the Loch Ness Monster. And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
  ans:
  - Jesus...

- que:
  - Where's it coming? Where's he landing?
  ans:
  - The Pentagon.

- que:
  - What if he's telling the truth?
  ans:
  - Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.

- que:
  - Since how long?
  ans:
  - Since as long as we've been keeping records...

- que:
  - For how long?
  ans:
  - We saw it in the office. It went from this big... to big... in a day.

- que:
  - Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
  ans:
  - It's marble.

- que:
  - Would you call this a code 100?
  ans:
  - In case I need it.

- que:
  - Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
  ans:
  - Yeah. His dream and our worst nightmare.

- que:
  - Kay. Seriously. What if he actually means what he says?
  ans:
  - So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...

- que:
  - So... how'd you hear about this?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work.

- que:
  - With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
  ans:
  - Exactly. I very much enjoy that.

- que:
  - Do have any idea what I just said?
  ans:
  - Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...

- que:
  - It's hard to find. It's an old civil war cemetery. Nobody ever goes there. So... what is it you say you do?
  ans:
  - I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, first of all, it's entomologist.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen. And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.

- que:
  - But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.

- que:
  - So... how did they get here?
  ans:
  - What do we do? Lean into it.

- que:
  - What the hell does that mean?
  ans:
  - Actually... I don't know.

- que:
  - Out of focus?
  ans:
  - The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.

- que:
  - Yeah ... ?
  ans:
  - Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.

- que:
  - What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack. Recognize this?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You figured what?
  ans:
  - Your licence is revoked. Permanently.

- que:
  - I understand. I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
  ans:
  - Come on now. People are smart.

- que:
  - Not bad. Briliiant, actually. You come unarmed, and alone. Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
  ans:
  - Give or take. It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last. We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.

- que:
  - Try seven. From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident. You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh?
  ans:
  - It's... coming.

- que:
  - Yeah, I'll talk to you.
  ans:
  - What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming?

- que:
  - ... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years?
  ans:
  - Nope. Nothing at all.

- que:
  - Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
  ans:
  - Noon exactly.

- que:
  - How'd you know that? Kay?
  ans:
  - Cause I think we're looking at it.

- que:
  - What if I don't?
  ans:
  - In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.

- que:
  - Will it lower the curve?
  ans:
  - I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.

- que:
  - This guy. Where was he?
  ans:
  - We're from Scientific American. We read about your discovery. We'd like to take a look.

- que:
  - This it?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.

- que:
  - We need to talk to you about the alien.
  ans:
  - Come again?

- que:
  - Which way?
  ans:
  - Fine. Good.

- que:
  - Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
  ans:
  - I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school.

- que:
  - What the hell is going on?
  ans:
  - He's gone, too.

- que:
  - What about the other agents? Ella? Tee?
  ans:
  - Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.

- que:
  - Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive?
  ans:
  - Hard to tell. I hope not.

- que:
  - Dee? What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I'm getting a trajectory...

- que:
  - And they're buying it?
  ans:
  - They went right to the President.

- que:
  - They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
  ans:
  - As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed. All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.

- que:
  - Where's he making his big speech?
  ans:
  - They haven't announced it yet. All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.

- que:
  - And get this, you know how humans evolved from primates? Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me. Insects.

- que:
  - How'd you know?
  ans:
  - Just a guess. But I think found a nest.

- que:
  - Now, what are we looking at? Keys. Look at them all. Why do we have them? Mr. President?
  ans:
  - Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.

- que:
  - If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
  ans:
  - They're inside.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Drop some money.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Anderton --

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Someplace safe.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - The other two will die without me.

- que:
  - You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
  ans:
  - Agatha, you're never going back there.

- que:
  - Who wanted her little girl back?
  ans:
  - The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.

- que:
  - She died?
  ans:
  - She grew up.

- que:
  - She's still alive?
  ans:
  - She's not alive, but she didn't die.

- que:
  - Then who was he?
  ans:
  - Just some guy... they found.

- que:
  - Found? Where?
  ans:
  - Somewhere.

- que:
  - Think, John. Why would they set you up?
  ans:
  - Because I found out about her...

- que:
  - About who?
  ans:
  - Anne Lively...

- que:
  - How did I not see this? Agatha, who killed you mother? Who killed Anne Lively?
  ans:
  - That's comforting.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care? They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.

- que:
  - We know each other?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes.

- que:
  - From where? D.C.?
  ans:
  - So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...

- que:
  - The nano... what?
  ans:
  - I'm setting up a timer. When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here. But not before then, or you'll --

- que:
  - You the sentry?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. I'm Gideon. The music relaxes the prisoners.

- que:
  - I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
  ans:
  - No, you're not in trouble. I'm interested in a murder.

- que:
  - Kill type?
  ans:
  - Drowning.

- que:
  - This about the Justice Department? They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m. Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?
  ans:
  - That's an old one. One of our first.

- que:
  - This is the official composite of the three precogs?
  ans:
  - That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.

- que:
  - You the only sentry?
  ans:
  - I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.

- que:
  - Why's he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
  ans:
  - On account of those are not his eyes. He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.

- que:
  - So she cleaned up. Where is she now?
  ans:
  - You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.

- que:
  - You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him. If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
  ans:
  - Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?

- que:
  - I understand. What's the other thing?
  ans:
  - Tuck in your shirt.

- que:
  - And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
  ans:
  - Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.

- que:
  - What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
  ans:
  - I'm fine, Lamar.

- que:
  - Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
  ans:
  - This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.

- que:
  - Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
  ans:
  - Somebody named Leo Crow.

- que:
  - And who the hell is that?
  ans:
  - I have no idea. I've never heard of him. But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.

- que:
  - Can you fake the cerebral output?
  ans:
  - We're years from that. John, I'm asking you, please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.

- que:
  - You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
  ans:
  - You're kidding, that's today?

- que:
  - Okay, Jad, what's coming?
  ans:
  - Red Ball -- double homicide, one male, one female. Killer's male, white, 40's.

- que:
  - Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route. What's our confirmed time?
  ans:
  - From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.

- que:
  - Somewhere near the capital?
  ans:
  - No maglev system.

- que:
  - The mall?
  ans:
  - Georgetown.

- que:
  - Yeah? So?
  ans:
  - Now look at him...

- que:
  - Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
  ans:
  - Did he close the front door?

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Go back to work. All of you.

- que:
  - Jad. How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
  ans:
  - We're in motion on something.

- que:
  - Red Ball?
  ans:
  - Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one.

- que:
  - Any ID on the shooter yet?
  ans:
  - Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...

- que:
  - But it's not the future if you stop it. Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - Why did you catch that?
  ans:
  - Because it was going to fall.

- que:
  - You're certain?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
  ans:
  - It was Iris Hineman. She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.

- que:
  - To Hineman?
  ans:
  - To them.

- que:
  - Really? You've never been inside?
  ans:
  - We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.

- que:
  - So I'll be the first one to go in then?
  ans:
  - Maybe you didn't hear me.

- que:
  - What does he think of your chosen line of work?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.

- que:
  - Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
  ans:
  - Flaws.

- que:
  - You gonna tell on me?
  ans:
  - Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.

- que:
  - Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
  ans:
  - Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...

- que:
  - To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
  ans:
  - She said...

- que:
  - Do I know you? Who are you?
  ans:
  - I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...

- que:
  - Are these all of her previsions?
  ans:
  - I need your help.

- que:
  - She's a precog?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Are you reading my mind right now?
  ans:
  - Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So now I need you to hack into her.

- que:
  - What happened? Where's the rest?
  ans:
  - Four. Wow. What a big boy. I love you, Sean.

- que:
  - Wanna hear something funny?
  ans:
  - What the hell.

- que:
  - You're alive?
  ans:
  - No. He got tired of pretending.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - His name was Sean. Six years ago. Francis pool.

- que:
  - You're not gonna kill me?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Tell me, who was it, set this up?
  ans:
  - If I tell you, my family gets nothing.

- que:
  - Good-bye, Crow.
  ans:
  - Who made you do this?

- que:
  - Something wrong?
  ans:
  - I'm a little dizzy...

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...

- que:
  - Just what is it you think I can do for you?
  ans:
  - You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.

- que:
  - What's so funny?
  ans:
  - You don't seem all that proud.

- que:
  - Heal who?
  ans:
  - The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.

- que:
  - You say some of the children died?
  ans:
  - I'm not a murderer. I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.

- que:
  - So you won't help me?
  ans:
  - I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.

- que:
  - Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
  ans:
  - Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.

- que:
  - You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
  ans:
  - I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.

- que:
  - Answer my question. Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.

- que:
  - Do you? Really?
  ans:
  - You want to bring it down.

- que:
  - Why should I trust you?
  ans:
  - You said they're destroyed.

- que:
  - What safe place is that?
  ans:
  - The safest place of all.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Inside the Precog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it.

- que:
  - How do I even know which one has it?
  ans:
  - It's always in the more gifted of the three.

- que:
  - Which one is that?
  ans:
  - The female.

- que:
  - John?
  ans:
  - He's dead, Lara.

- que:
  - Oh, God, what did you do?
  ans:
  - This is all my fault.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him.

- que:
  - Lamar --
  ans:
  - Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.

- que:
  - How did you get this?
  ans:
  - I padded your expense account for the last six months.

- que:
  - He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged. What did you talk about?
  ans:
  - The Mets. John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.

- que:
  - Six years ago. What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
  ans:
  - None of your damn business.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.

- que:
  - Good God. What was that?
  ans:
  - Wait, just a second...

- que:
  - He told me about this. You got this from Containment?
  ans:
  - It's the same prevision.

- que:
  - I did find it. It was inside of Agatha all this time. So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
  ans:
  - Danny, tell me what you're thinking.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Precog Deja Vu...

- que:
  - So there is a way to fool the system?
  ans:
  - I wanna kill my boss.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. Okay. You got some images I can work with?
  ans:
  - Right here.

- que:
  - Nice to meet you. Gum?
  ans:
  - So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.

- que:
  - Can't they shut that off?
  ans:
  - That's the Red Ball Alarm.

- que:
  - People have gotten the message. Gum?
  ans:
  - The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood. And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.

- que:
  - No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
  ans:
  - Because he thinks he's innocent.

- que:
  - Two?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter. He wins.

- que:
  - If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
  ans:
  - They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.

- que:
  - I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
  ans:
  - Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - None. This was arranged.

- que:
  - That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The man across the street. I've seen him before...

- que:
  - What about your meeting?
  ans:
  - I'll reschedule. I've been working too much anyway.

- que:
  - Raincheck?
  ans:
  - Sure. Raincheck.

- que:
  - This your work?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Thanks. You take anything in your coffee?
  ans:
  - Cream and sugar.

- que:
  - Just sugar then. You and John ever come here?
  ans:
  - We used to, every summer.

- que:
  - He's not here now, is he?
  ans:
  - I don't have any sugar either.

- que:
  - Thank you. He hasn't tried to contact you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
  ans:
  - No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.

- que:
  - So you haven't seen his apartment?
  ans:
  - That was our apartment.

- que:
  - Have you been there recently?
  ans:
  - Since right after we lost our son.

- que:
  - But John was with him at the pool?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What was it then?
  ans:
  - The FBI found something that belonged to my son. A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...

- que:
  - To what? Trap him?
  ans:
  - To prevent a murder. Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.

- que:
  - What does he want with a precog?
  ans:
  - What do you think? So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.

- que:
  - Wally, the other two can still function, right?
  ans:
  - You don't understand... they're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.

- que:
  - Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
  ans:
  - Jesus...

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.

- que:
  - You're Bobby, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
  ans:
  - No thank you.

- que:
  - Is it a good room?
  ans:
  - I can take you down there.

- que:
  - Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
  ans:
  - Not on me, sir.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Take it.

- que:
  - Is it the good room?
  ans:
  - All the suites are about the same.

- que:
  - What if I gave you forty?
  ans:
  - It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.

- que:
  - Women?
  ans:
  - Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.

- que:
  - So, wait, you're from where?
  ans:
  - Manhattan.

- que:
  - You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I don't get it. What do you do?
  ans:
  - We're in Fashion.

- que:
  - So you're models?
  ans:
  - I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.

- que:
  - Is he cute?
  ans:
  - He's okay.

- que:
  - Should I fuck him?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Do whatever you want.

- que:
  - He's great, right. Is he great?
  ans:
  - He's alright.

- que:
  - Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
  ans:
  - What the fuck was that about?

- que:
  - And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
  ans:
  - I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.

- que:
  - What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
  ans:
  - Ricky's not wearing one.

- que:
  - A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
  ans:
  - She's, uh, sleeping.

- que:
  - Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What's wrong, baby?
  ans:
  - He's not doing it.

- que:
  - Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Mommy's not home?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.

- que:
  - No. What kind of bachelor party?
  ans:
  - The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.

- que:
  - A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
  ans:
  - Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.

- que:
  - I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
  ans:
  - They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.

- que:
  - Who's watching the baby?
  ans:
  - She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.

- que:
  - You talk to Max today?
  ans:
  - I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.

- que:
  - No coke tonight. Right?
  ans:
  - Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.

- que:
  - Yeah? You sure?
  ans:
  - Go.

- que:
  - With what?
  ans:
  - Max offered to stake me.

- que:
  - How could you let her see this?
  ans:
  - Goodbye, Bobby.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - I want you to take her with you.

- que:
  - But what about them?
  ans:
  - I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.

- que:
  - Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
  ans:
  - Your dance is over.

- que:
  - It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
  ans:
  - I had a fight up at Sportsman's.

- que:
  - Well, you look it. You win?
  ans:
  - Draw.

- que:
  - What's your record at?
  ans:
  - 5-5-1.

- que:
  - You driving her?
  ans:
  - Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.

- que:
  - What's his name?
  ans:
  - Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.

- que:
  - Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
  ans:
  - Shit.

- que:
  - Why isn't Ruiz coming?
  ans:
  - This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.

- que:
  - Where is this happening?
  ans:
  - We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.

- que:
  - Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - He must have that shit troughed.

- que:
  - Ruiz tied in out there?
  ans:
  - Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.

- que:
  - Where we going?
  ans:
  - Quick drop. In and out.

- que:
  - Where's Ricky?
  ans:
  - Ricky's taken care of.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.

- que:
  - That it?
  ans:
  - That's it.

- que:
  - You like the ponies?
  ans:
  - Sure. Yeah.

- que:
  - You bet the ponies?
  ans:
  - Me? No. Not really.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.

- que:
  - This one?
  ans:
  - Pshhh...

- que:
  - She was fast, huh?
  ans:
  - That's why they call it the smart money.

- que:
  - I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
  ans:
  - Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.

- que:
  - So, that's it. I'm out?
  ans:
  - I didn't say that.

- que:
  - Then what are you saying?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sorry.

- que:
  - Ruiz knows about this?
  ans:
  - Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.

- que:
  - Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
  ans:
  - You told him you liked him.

- que:
  - You vouch for him?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Sure.

- que:
  - Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
  ans:
  - No. Okay. I'll think about it.

- que:
  - What drill?
  ans:
  - We get it. We're sorry.

- que:
  - Tom, the Welsh dude --
  ans:
  - What's the plan?

- que:
  - You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
  ans:
  - Hi. I, uh, think that's us.

- que:
  - You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.

- que:
  - Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - Where is the Soho Grand?
  ans:
  - Soho.

- que:
  - So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.

- que:
  - You don't know where you're going?
  ans:
  - No. Just the cross streets.

- que:
  - Spa?
  ans:
  - Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.

- que:
  - Understand me?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
  ans:
  - Ricky's taken care of.

- que:
  - Taken care of?
  ans:
  - Yeah, he's getting there on his own.

- que:
  - So's this. Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
  ans:
  - Listen, man, we really gotta...

- que:
  - I be off in a minute. Say again...?
  ans:
  - We're with Ruiz.

- que:
  - We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
  ans:
  - Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.

- que:
  - Can you check?
  ans:
  - He's not here.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - So, it was a draw.

- que:
  - How am I being shitty?
  ans:
  - Don't be shitty.

- que:
  - Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I know the number.

- que:
  - I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
  ans:
  - I got no idea.

- que:
  - Then why do you try to get in?
  ans:
  - Fuck them.

- que:
  - Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
  ans:
  - You wanna go right now?

- que:
  - What are we delivering?
  ans:
  - We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.

- que:
  - Who is this fucking Ruiz?
  ans:
  - Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.

- que:
  - How'd you unlock my phone?
  ans:
  - I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.

- que:
  - See? Now everyone's got one on. What do you got there?
  ans:
  - Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.

- que:
  - What? Did she say something?
  ans:
  - She wants you to paint the ashtray.

- que:
  - Who's driving her?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Is that the woman from..?
  ans:
  - She really liked the kitchen.

- que:
  - Holy shit. Can you believe this?
  ans:
  - Pretty nice.

- que:
  - What's the movie?
  ans:
  - I'll get the girl.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.

- que:
  - Shhh... Hello, room service?
  ans:
  - C'mon, man...

- que:
  - How much is it?
  ans:
  - How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.

- que:
  - How much was it?
  ans:
  - Forty-six.

- que:
  - Jesus, man. Plus ten?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I guess.

- que:
  - Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
  ans:
  - Don't worry about it. Just be smart.

- que:
  - Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
  ans:
  - Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I know you're not calling Jimmy.

- que:
  - As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
  ans:
  - We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.

- que:
  - Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
  ans:
  - Fuck...

- que:
  - What exactly did they say?
  ans:
  - They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.

- que:
  - They didn't say an address?
  ans:
  - I told you what they said.

- que:
  - How'd they know who you were?
  ans:
  - They asked who it was.

- que:
  - What the fuck do you have to complain about?
  ans:
  - Don't even start.

- que:
  - You know this guy?
  ans:
  - His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.

- que:
  - Yeah. What vibe?
  ans:
  - I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.

- que:
  - So is this the drop?
  ans:
  - Like I said, I don't know.

- que:
  - He woulda told us right?
  ans:
  - You would think.

- que:
  - You too?
  ans:
  - Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.

- que:
  - Where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - Back in.

- que:
  - You fucking nuts?
  ans:
  - Work's over. I'm gonna party.

- que:
  - What the hell did you do?
  ans:
  - I swear to God, I didn't do anything.

- que:
  - What the fuck was that about?
  ans:
  - She was jonesing for me.

- que:
  - What's up?
  ans:
  - He wants to see us now.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.

- que:
  - Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
  ans:
  - It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.

- que:
  - I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
  ans:
  - You gonna shank him in the shower?

- que:
  - Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
  ans:
  - Nothing, man.

- que:
  - You want us strapped, don't you?
  ans:
  - Let's do it.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - The penguin house.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.

- que:
  - Did you hear what he just said?
  ans:
  - Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.

- que:
  - You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
  ans:
  - That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.

- que:
  - You're out of money?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you have left?
  ans:
  - Eighty.

- que:
  - Eighty bucks?!?
  ans:
  - Eighty five.

- que:
  - What happened to the fifteen hundred?
  ans:
  - They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...

- que:
  - So what do we do?
  ans:
  - Let's just go now and wait.

- que:
  - Three and a half hours?
  ans:
  - I don't want to take any more chances.

- que:
  - Where do you get this shit?
  ans:
  - You're not getting a gun.

- que:
  - Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
  ans:
  - Easy...

- que:
  - I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
  ans:
  - No. I'll wait here.

- que:
  - Fine, fine. And you were...?
  ans:
  - Bobby and Ricky.

- que:
  - And you grew up in Manhattan?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I want it.

- que:
  - How is it you're good? You on a list?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Ricky Slade.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Cardiff Giant. Just check.

- que:
  - Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
  ans:
  - Hey. I'm half Lebanese.

- que:
  - Did you see that shit? Motherfucker. You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
  ans:
  - He's on the list.

- que:
  - You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
  ans:
  - It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.

- que:
  - How much is what?
  ans:
  - The videos.

- que:
  - Yes. Would you care for another one?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Where do you live?
  ans:
  - Excuse me.

- que:
  - I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
  ans:
  - Where's Spa.

- que:
  - How do you know it's not drugs?
  ans:
  - Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.

- que:
  - It means you got a gun?
  ans:
  - I'm not saying shit to neither of you.

- que:
  - What? Why am I bad?
  ans:
  - See you later.

- que:
  - You really in trouble?
  ans:
  - Stop.

- que:
  - So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
  ans:
  - Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.

- que:
  - And where is...?
  ans:
  - Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.

- que:
  - Sure. Anyplace in particular?
  ans:
  - I hear the China Club is a laugh.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - A little Charlie, perhaps.

- que:
  - Coke?
  ans:
  - I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.

- que:
  - No, really, mate?
  ans:
  - Here...

- que:
  - Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
  ans:
  - No, thanks, man. We got to head out.

- que:
  - Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
  ans:
  - Couldn't make it. Here's the money.

  - Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You think this shit's funny, Ho?
  ans:
  - Nah, man...

- que:
  - You think it's funny, motherfucker?
  ans:
  - Last thing I want is you with a gun.

- que:
  - The Soho Grand?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're from LA, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So you're our own private guy?
  ans:
  - I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.

- que:
  - I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
  ans:
  - The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.

- que:
  - A lot of Persians?
  ans:
  - Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.

- que:
  - Sure. You boys want anything?
  ans:
  - Yeah, bring us four fernet.

- que:
  - Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
  ans:
  - We're square.

- que:
  - dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
  ans:
  - You rode?

- que:
  - We're going to New York?
  ans:
  - Yes. You're going to New York.

- que:
  - And the money. Where do we bring the money?
  ans:
  - That money is your per diem.

- que:
  - And where do we bring it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What about my keys?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You want... Why are you picking on me?
  ans:
  - Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.

- que:
  - So, wait, what are we dropping off?
  ans:
  - Goodbye.

- que:
  - What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
  ans:
  - Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.

- que:
  - Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
  ans:
  - What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.

- que:
  - Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Outfit? What's he talking about?
  ans:
  - The Red Dragon.

- que:
  - When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street. Why aren't you coming?
  ans:
  - That's none of your fucking business.

- que:
  - And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
  ans:
  - So, you must be the Red Dragon.

- que:
  - Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
  ans:
  - Edinburgh.

- que:
  - And where might that be?
  ans:
  - I'll get it.

- que:
  - What they call you?
  ans:
  - Red, and I ain't no punk.

- que:
  - Heard where?
  ans:
  - Where I come from. Boston.

- que:
  - You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
  ans:
  - My papa taught me one thing, don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.

- que:
  - Is your papa West Indian?
  ans:
  - No, my mama. She's from Grenada.

- que:
  - Where can I get a hold of you?
  ans:
  - YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.

- que:
  - Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do. 'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Did you just now con me?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

  ans:
  - You know it.

- que:
  - That really you, Red?
  ans:
  - You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

- que:
  - That's a fact. What you do, boy?
  ans:
  - Yeah, got to do something about you.

- que:
  - What you say?
  ans:
  - He gave it to you, Archie. He did.

- que:
  - Who the hell are you?
  ans:
  - Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.

- que:
  - Man, what do you want?
  ans:
  - You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.

- que:
  - If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
  ans:
  - I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.

- que:
  - Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
  ans:
  - That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.

- que:
  - What did you give it to me for then?
  ans:
  - Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.

- que:
  - Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
  ans:
  - I ain't said I'm ashamed.

- que:
  - Elijah who?
  ans:
  - Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.

- que:
  - What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
  ans:
  - You the only cat don't come on with that \"Whatcha know, daddy\" jive; and you don't cuss none.

- que:
  - What do you do with your time?
  ans:
  - That's what Mama used to say.

- que:
  - What the hell for, man?
  ans:
  - Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.

- que:
  - That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
  ans:
  - They sure ain't no black man's books in here.

- que:
  - Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
  ans:
  - Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.

- que:
  - Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
  ans:
  - Where am I gonna start?

- que:
  - Lemme tell you about history, black history. You listening?
  ans:
  - You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.

- que:
  - I don't know what to say to Allah.
  ans:
  - Who are you?

- que:
  - Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
  ans:
  - Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.

- que:
  - Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
  ans:
  - Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.

- que:
  - Is the program ready?
  ans:
  - No, Brother Minister.

- que:
  - Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
  ans:
  - She ate.

- que:
  - Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
  ans:
  - If you want to tell me.

- que:
  - Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
  ans:
  - Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?

- que:
  - Could we sit down someplace?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.

- que:
  - How do you like it?
  ans:
  - Delicious.

- que:
  - They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
  ans:
  - You have enough worries of your own.

- que:
  - Why do you ask?
  ans:
  - Just an idle question.

- que:
  - How old are you, Betty?
  ans:
  - There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.

- que:
  - Are you?
  ans:
  - And dogged when I set my mind to something.

- que:
  - What have you set your mind to?
  ans:
  - Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.

- que:
  - At a gas station. Will you marry me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Yes. Did you eat?
  ans:
  - I love you.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - The simplest thing in the world, I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.

- que:
  - Why are you looking at me like that?
  ans:
  - Because you're in trouble.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.

- que:
  - The talk is everywhere!
  ans:
  - We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.

- que:
  - Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.

- que:
  - Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
  ans:
  - The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.

- que:
  - Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
  ans:
  - Get some sleep.

- que:
  - Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
  ans:
  - Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.

- que:
  - I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
  ans:
  - I don't think that's such a good idea.

- que:
  - I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
  ans:
  - I assumed...

- que:
  - Brother Minister, what is wrong?
  ans:
  - Let's cancel.

- que:
  - Is my family here yet?
  ans:
  - Down front as always.

- que:
  - Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
  ans:
  - Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.

- que:
  - You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
  ans:
  - I don't think we know for certain.

- que:
  - They were Hebrew, weren't they?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What color were the original Hebrews?
  ans:
  - I told you we don't know for certain.

- que:
  - Just what are you saying?
  ans:
  - I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.

- que:
  - Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
  ans:
  - Stop me if I'm wrong. I \"polarize the community.\" I \"erroneously appraise the racial picture.\"

- que:
  - Did you see the papers today?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir, I did.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something?
  ans:
  - Sure, man.

- que:
  - Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
  ans:
  - Are you Elijah's pimp?

- que:
  - Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
  ans:
  - Bout every other night, Red.

- que:
  - She know?
  ans:
  - If she got eyes, she do.

- que:
  - Is she hooking?
  ans:
  - Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.

- que:
  - How many you turning out?
  ans:
  - 500.

- que:
  - How long has this been going on?
  ans:
  - All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.

- que:
  - What does Sidney say?
  ans:
  - I'm with you, Brother Minister.

- que:
  - ...That isn't a whore?
  ans:
  - That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.

- que:
  - You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
  ans:
  - C'mere.

- que:
  - You hear me, girl?
  ans:
  - You the man.

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - You will, baby -- if the time come.

- que:
  - Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
  ans:
  - I ain't doing bad.

- que:
  - Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
  ans:
  - I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.

- que:
  - How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
  ans:
  - Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.

- que:
  - What can you do?
  ans:
  - Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.

- que:
  - Might be all right.
  ans:
  - So what about him?

- que:
  - You want to be the head man?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Head nigger in charge?
  ans:
  - I'm the man.

- que:
  - Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
  ans:
  - Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.

- que:
  - Who the hell are they?
  ans:
  - Brothers of Brother Johnson.

- que:
  - He told you that?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.

- que:
  - Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can. This page?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Am I a suspect?
  ans:
  - No. It would be convenient, but no.

- que:
  - It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
  ans:
  - Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.

- que:
  - The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
  ans:
  - I don't know shit about you.

- que:
  - Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
  ans:
  - So you are going to talk me to death.

- que:
  - Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
  ans:
  - I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.

- que:
  - My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
  ans:
  - No, but I have to admit I thought about it.

- que:
  - You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
  ans:
  - I'm not... easy.

- que:
  - So what do I get in return?
  ans:
  - Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.

- que:
  - I need something. Do you have banking connections?
  ans:
  - I have connections.

- que:
  - Where do I find you?
  ans:
  - I'll call you tomorrow.

- que:
  - What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
  ans:
  - He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.

- que:
  - Where does he live?
  ans:
  - Give me the address.

- que:
  - I show, you give me the information?
  ans:
  - Deal.

- que:
  - Who's he?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.

- que:
  - Is it loaded?
  ans:
  - It's loaded.

- que:
  - How does it affect you?
  ans:
  - My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.

- que:
  - I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
  ans:
  - No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.

- que:
  - Creasy? Where the fuck are you?
  ans:
  - I'm here.

- que:
  - What do you mean, I'm here?
  ans:
  - I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.

- que:
  - So what's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing wrong.

- que:
  - But don't you stay in El Paso?
  ans:
  - Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.

- que:
  - You been working?
  ans:
  - Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.

- que:
  - How long you staying, Crease?
  ans:
  - Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.

- que:
  - You did something on impulse?
  ans:
  - Everything happens once if you live long enough.

- que:
  - You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
  ans:
  - Well, you'd have to keep it under control.

- que:
  - And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
  ans:
  - You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I came to visit you.

- que:
  - A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
  ans:
  - Oh, now you think I can be trusted.

- que:
  - You mean a misfire?
  ans:
  - I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.

- que:
  - Creasy?
  ans:
  - Sorry I woke you, Ray.

- que:
  - Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
  ans:
  - I said the plan was right here.

- que:
  - Yes or no?
  ans:
  - I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.

- que:
  - Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers?
  ans:
  - Different door. Not far from here.

- que:
  - Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
  ans:
  - If they like me.

- que:
  - That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
  ans:
  - Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?

- que:
  - Who's Emilio?
  ans:
  - My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.

- que:
  - In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
  ans:
  - Creasy. Just call me Creasy.

- que:
  - Where are you from, Creasy?
  ans:
  - The United States.

- que:
  - I know. But which state?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for potential.

- que:
  - Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
  ans:
  - Someone gave him more money than we could.

- que:
  - Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
  ans:
  - Time will tell.

- que:
  - There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
  ans:
  - Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.

- que:
  - Did you like school, Creasy?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Not at all?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Hmmm?
  ans:
  - It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.

- que:
  - So you were unhappy?
  ans:
  - Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.

- que:
  - I go to school, don't I?
  ans:
  - You're fast.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.

- que:
  - Maybe. Did you hear him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How do you think he got out?
  ans:
  - Well, I let him go.

- que:
  - It's better to be free, right?
  ans:
  - Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.

- que:
  - I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
  ans:
  - My ankle.

- que:
  - The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
  ans:
  - White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.

- que:
  - Do you always sleep with him?
  ans:
  - I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.

- que:
  - Did you sleep alright?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
  ans:
  - In a week you should be fine.

- que:
  - Why do you ask?
  ans:
  - It was in a book at school. Concubine.

- que:
  - But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
  ans:
  - In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.

- que:
  - So how come you know so much about those countries?
  ans:
  - I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.

- que:
  - What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
  ans:
  - No, that was in Columbia.

- que:
  - Remember you asked me what state I was from?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Did you used to?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Two or three.

- que:
  - Where's my mother?
  ans:
  - I dropped her at home.

- que:
  - It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
  ans:
  - I'm not afraid you, Creasy.

- que:
  - Are you afraid of me?
  ans:
  - The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

- que:
  - What's so important in Los Angeles?
  ans:
  - Your father has business.

- que:
  - Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
  ans:
  - The blocks.

- que:
  - Could I stop you?
  ans:
  - You don't drink like you used to.

- que:
  - My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
  ans:
  - Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.

- que:
  - You think too much?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.

- que:
  - Dyslexic?
  ans:
  - You got that right.

- que:
  - The world of our children. How dare they?
  ans:
  - It's war. The weakest suffer the most.

- que:
  - You've done much of this work before?
  ans:
  - Never.

- que:
  - How are you getting along with Pinta?
  ans:
  - We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.

- que:
  - Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
  ans:
  - Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.

- que:
  - Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
  ans:
  - Because... I was already dead.

- que:
  - Planned what?
  ans:
  - I don't believe you.

- que:
  - What was her name?
  ans:
  - Camila. Camila Valencias.

- que:
  - Do you know what she told me last night?
  ans:
  - Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.

- que:
  - Yeah? And if she was ugly?
  ans:
  - And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.

- que:
  - Yes, mom?
  ans:
  - This is Mr. Creasy.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'...

- que:
  - And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
  ans:
  - I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.

- que:
  - Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
  ans:
  - I think it's nice he's American.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - Creasy. Pinta likes him.

- que:
  - What? Who?
  ans:
  - Creasy.

- que:
  - What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
  ans:
  - None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.

- que:
  - What was she to Creasy then?
  ans:
  - Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.

- que:
  - You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
  ans:
  - Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.

- que:
  - Which one was that?
  ans:
  - That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.

- que:
  - Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
  ans:
  - I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - I could see she likes you.

- que:
  - My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
  ans:
  - My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

- que:
  - Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
  ans:
  - There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.

- que:
  - Who you gonna call?
  ans:
  - I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.

- que:
  - Are you kidding?
  ans:
  - You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.

- que:
  - I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
  ans:
  - Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.

- que:
  - Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
  ans:
  - He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.

- que:
  - Who told you that?
  ans:
  - Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.

- que:
  - I came to see you. How you feel?
  ans:
  - I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.

- que:
  - Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
  ans:
  - I don't think I remember him.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.

- que:
  - Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
  ans:
  - You told me.

- que:
  - What happen?
  ans:
  - She gave me the evil eye.

- que:
  - Ah?
  ans:
  - You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...

- que:
  - When was this?
  ans:
  - This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.

- que:
  - My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
  ans:
  - So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:

- que:
  - You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.

- que:
  - Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
  ans:
  - I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.

  - It's loaded with what?
  ans:
  - Tomatoes.

- que:
  - How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?

  ans:

  ans:
  - Well...

  ans:
  - That's swell, Missus Fusari.

- que:
  - Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
  ans:
  - Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.

- que:
  - Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
  ans:
  - Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.

- que:
  - How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
  ans:
  - Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.

  - Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
  ans:
  - Tommy...

- que:
  - We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
  ans:
  - I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?

- que:
  - You talked to Walt?
  ans:
  - He's parted his moorings.

- que:
  - What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.

- que:
  - What is, Red, the intention or the act?
  ans:
  - I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.

- que:
  - Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
  ans:
  - He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.

- que:
  - Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
  ans:
  - Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.

- que:
  - How you, Radar?
  ans:
  - You boys'll have to go to work early.

- que:
  - What are you going to do with him?
  ans:
  - Well... I was going to name you Chief Surgeon... To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.

- que:
  - I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Hospital.

- que:
  - Which hospital?
  ans:
  - Back home.

- que:
  - Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
  ans:
  - No. Or why you should.

- que:
  - Don't you use olives?
  ans:
  - Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.

- que:
  - I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Not enough to be a pro.

- que:
  - Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
  ans:
  - There's only one way.

- que:
  - You really think we hurt him that bad?
  ans:
  - Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.

- que:
  - I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
  ans:
  - Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?

- que:
  - Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
  ans:
  - I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.

- que:
  - You  must  open  me  up  again?
  ans:
  - This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.

- que:
  - But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
  ans:
  - I don't drink intoxicants.

- que:
  - The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
  ans:
  - Wisconsin.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - We got to stop them right here.

- que:
  - You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
  ans:
  - What's there to do? You found the sliver.

- que:
  - You got directions?
  ans:
  - Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.

- que:
  - Make it yourself, or is it real?
  ans:
  - Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.

- que:
  - Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
  ans:
  - Crabapple Cove. Maine.

- que:
  - Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
  ans:
  - We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.

- que:
  - Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore  House. You in the market Duke?
  ans:
  - I done my shopping in Seoul last night.

- que:
  - What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
  ans:
  - Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.

- que:
  - Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
  ans:
  - Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - The chest-cutter.

- que:
  - Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
  ans:
  - Sixteen times.

- que:
  - Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
  ans:
  - Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.

- que:
  - And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
  ans:
  - Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice. It's a different ritual but it works the same.

- que:
  - What do you think, Trapper?
  ans:
  - Y'all just act natural.

- que:
  - Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
  ans:
  - Never mind. Forget it.

- que:
  - What's he got to write, for God's sake?
  ans:
  - An application to Androscoggin College.

- que:
  - How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
  ans:
  - I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.

- que:
  - Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
  ans:
  - All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...

- que:
  - How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
  ans:
  - Any time. Whenever we want.

- que:
  - Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
  ans:
  - Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.

- que:
  - Ravenous. What about you?
  ans:
  - Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...

- que:
  - Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
  ans:
  - Give us this day our daily...

- que:
  - You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
  ans:
  - ...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...

- que:
  - Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
  ans:
  - ...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.

- que:
  - But what about Major Houlihan?
  ans:
  - Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.

- que:
  - Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
  ans:
  - Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.

- que:
  - I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
  ans:
  - Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - SERGEANT We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.

- que:
  - SERGEANT C-A-M-E-M...?
  ans:
  - B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.

- que:
  - If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
  ans:
  - That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.

- que:
  - What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
  ans:
  - Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.

- que:
  - But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
  ans:
  - But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.

- que:
  - Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
  ans:
  - And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.

- que:
  - Is he out?
  ans:
  - Like the Rock of Gibraltar.

- que:
  - Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
  ans:
  - It's in pretty deep.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.

- que:
  - It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
  ans:
  - They're coming.

- que:
  - So what makes you think he'll play for us?
  ans:
  - We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.

- que:
  - Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
  ans:
  - Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.

- que:
  - All of them?
  ans:
  - That's right. We work well together.

- que:
  - Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
  ans:
  - Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.

- que:
  - How did you get called that?
  ans:
  - The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.

- que:
  - It isn't always this rough?
  ans:
  - Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.

- que:
  - Our minds?
  ans:
  - For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...

- que:
  - And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
  ans:
  - It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.

- que:
  - Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
  ans:
  - But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye. You helped me pull together when I needed it.

- que:
  - You're leaving tomorrow?
  ans:
  - In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.

- que:
  - You're on his side all of the sudden?
  ans:
  - A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.

- que:
  - How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
  ans:
  - It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.

- que:
  - You're asking for somebody else?
  ans:
  - It happens to be a matter of life and death.

- que:
  - A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
  ans:
  - He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.

- que:
  - Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
  ans:
  - I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.

- que:
  - Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
  ans:
  - Second pint.

- que:
  - What do you want with those two medical officers?
  ans:
  - They missed the boat.

- que:
  - The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
  ans:
  - The one and only.

- que:
  - Why can't you look at him?
  ans:
  - I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.

- que:
  - What's the story?
  ans:
  - Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.

- que:
  - What's wrong with him?
  ans:
  - Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.

- que:
  - If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
  ans:
  - Tell me the whole story, Walt.

- que:
  - Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
  ans:
  - Homosexuality.

- que:
  - You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
  ans:
  - No, never in the slightest.

- que:
  - Just in dreams?
  ans:
  - Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.

- que:
  - That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
  ans:
  - No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.

- que:
  - Morning Painless. How they goin'?
  ans:
  - Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.

- que:
  - Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
  ans:
  - Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.

- que:
  - Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
  ans:
  - I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.

- que:
  - I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
  ans:
  - Nope, we're assigned heah.

- que:
  - Your tent?
  ans:
  - We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.

- que:
  - That's all the commitment you're offering me? Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
  ans:
  - You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.

- que:
  - Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
  ans:
  - You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.

- que:
  - You mean who hit who?
  ans:
  - Yes, that's what I mean.

- que:
  - What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...

- que:
  - One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
  ans:
  - Yes, dammit, and...

- que:
  - O'Reilly, what is it? There aren't more choppers coming?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid so, Colonel.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...

- que:
  - Morning, Radar. How were things?
  ans:
  - Splendid, sir. No problems.

- que:
  - Can you make out what they're talking about?
  ans:
  - I can try, sir.

- que:
  - Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
  ans:
  - I used to throw the javelin.

- que:
  - What's that, Henry?
  ans:
  - I out-coached that General Hammond.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.

- que:
  - Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
  ans:
  - I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.

- que:
  - That bad? But I guess you're right. We might as well see him. Got any caddie carts?
  ans:
  - Never mind.

- que:
  - Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
  ans:
  - No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.

- que:
  - How is he?
  ans:
  - Nice.

- que:
  - Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds. How is he?
  ans:
  - Yeah, maybe.

- que:
  - Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
  ans:
  - Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.

- que:
  - Are you all right?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I'm all right.

- que:
  - Action?
  ans:
  - Um-hum.

- que:
  - With all of it?
  ans:
  - Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.

- que:
  - Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
  ans:
  - Oh, crabby guy, huh?

- que:
  - Against what?
  ans:
  - Against anything. Just protest.

- que:
  - Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - John Doe. The one in there.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.

- que:
  - Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh ...

- que:
  - Me?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Can I help you pack?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - Do you care if I sit down out here?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - About me?
  ans:
  - Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.

- que:
  - Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
  ans:
  - Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.

- que:
  - I guess so. Then what happened?
  ans:
  - Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.

- que:
  - How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
  ans:
  - I don't know. About three hundred thousand.

- que:
  - Did you write this?
  ans:
  - Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.

- que:
  - ... Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - How much money do you get?
  ans:
  - Thirty dollars.

- que:
  - Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
  ans:
  - Money.

- que:
  - Money? Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm sure I can.

- que:
  - Oh, somebody else sitting there?
  ans:
  - No, no, nothat's your seat.

- que:
  - A third party?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go. Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
  ans:
  - Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, Father certainly would.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - The letter.

- que:
  - What letter?
  ans:
  - The letter from John Doe.

- que:
  - Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
  ans:
  - John Doe.

- que:
  - The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
  ans:
  - Well, you're catching on.

  - So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
  ans:
  - Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.

- que:
  - We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him. Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
  ans:
  - Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.

- que:
  - Yes. What's he doing here?
  ans:
  - Friend of his. They play duets together.

- que:
  - I got it all ready. Here.
  ans:
  - Duets? But can we trust him?

- que:
  - No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
  ans:
  - If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.

- que:
  - Thank you.
  ans:
  - What's the idea?

- que:
  - How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
  ans:

- que:
  - Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?

  - Ba-ll!

- que:
  - Grubbel's here. See?
  ans:
  - Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.

- que:
  - How could he be a fake?
  ans:
  - It must be some kind of a gag.

- que:
  - Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
  ans:
  - A what?

- que:
  - Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
  ans:
  - You ain't gonna get me to stay here.

  ans:
  - I trust him.

- que:
  - Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
  ans:
  - Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.

- que:
  - Now, that's all right, isn't it?
  ans:
  - You betcha.

- que:
  - Yeah. It certainly is.
  ans:
  - Yeah, you bet!

- que:
  - And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.

- que:
  - Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.

- que:
  - Huh? Get what?
  ans:
  - Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.

- que:
  - I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
  ans:
  - Yes. Sure.

- que:
  - Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
  ans:
  - How?

- que:

  ans:
  - Let go of me! This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so! Do you deny that?

- que:
  - She isn't?
  ans:
  - No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
  ans:
  - Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.

- que:
  - What do you mean, too bad?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.

- que:
  - Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
  ans:

  - Say, who's putting up this dough?
  ans:
  - Feller runs the Chronicle . Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.

  - Have you got the speech I gave you?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Is there a crowd in the street?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.

- que:
  - What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
  ans:
  - No -- you can't do that.

- que:
  - Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
  ans:
  - Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

- que:
  - You want me to go up with you?
  ans:
  - Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.

  ans:
  - May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.

- que:
  - Where did you find an old recording like that?
  ans:
  - Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson. Memories... Memory Lane or something...

- que:
  - Could I please have a little water?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - This cousin of yours... What's his name?
  ans:
  - Clarence Teal.

- que:
  - Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
  ans:
  - I won't get away with it.

- que:
  - Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
  ans:
  - This has nothing to do with Walter.

- que:
  - How can I help you with the particles?
  ans:
  - They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Tell my dad.

- que:
  - Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
  ans:
  - Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.

- que:
  - Where's the car?
  ans:
  - Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.

- que:
  - Am I gettin' the car?
  ans:
  - Automatic.

- que:
  - 2 Johnny who?
  ans:
  - 2 Hold on a second here.

- que:
  - Is there a problem?
  ans:

  ans:
  - ...a car.

- que:
  - What's the suspect's name?
  ans:
  - Earl.

- que:
  - Anything on Korda so far?
  ans:
  - Solis said to keep you clear of this.

- que:
  - Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
  ans:
  - Being faxed over now.

- que:
  - Are you in charge, Roper?
  ans:
  - Yep.

- que:
  - Is that all?
  ans:
  - For now that's all.

- que:
  - What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
  ans:
  - Open the bag, dump everything on the table.

- que:
  - I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
  ans:
  - Sorry... Habit.

- que:
  - We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
  ans:
  - If you say so.

- que:
  - You ever been in a hostage situation?
  ans:
  - Only at the very end.

- que:
  - What's the point of this?
  ans:
  - A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.

- que:
  - So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
  ans:
  - They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.

- que:
  - Recruited you from where?
  ans:
  - National Marksman Competition.

- que:
  - With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
  ans:
  - Furthest point I could find from New York.

- que:
  - You don't like New York?
  ans:
  - Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.

- que:
  - You'd never been out of New York?
  ans:
  - Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.

- que:
  - How did you like Toronto?
  ans:
  - It was okay.

- que:
  - You caught me on an \"up\" day. How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
  ans:
  - I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for \"fast advancement\".

- que:
  - Is there something wrong with that?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - How are we gonna get him out of there?
  ans:
  - We could fill it with water.

- que:
  - You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
  ans:
  - I don't gamble.

- que:
  - You living together?
  ans:
  - She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.

- que:
  - She grow up in Livingtston, too?
  ans:
  - No, no, no... She's from Hoboken.

- que:
  - Oh, \"city girl\". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
  ans:
  - We see each other every couple of months.

- que:
  - Every couple of months, huh?
  ans:
  - That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.

- que:
  - Do you really?
  ans:
  - No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.

- que:
  - Where did you hear that?
  ans:
  - Around. Barnett's tough competition.

- que:
  - You think you can learn, McCall?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
  ans:
  - If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.

- que:
  - You know the ten commandments?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What's the first commandment?
  ans:
  - Thou shall have no other God before me.

- que:
  - Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To save lives.

- que:
  - So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
  ans:
  - My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.

- que:
  - You're a compulsive gambler?
  ans:
  - I have two words for you... Seek help.

- que:
  - Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
  ans:
  - So what do you want?... An autograph.

- que:
  - He'll be running at the quarter pole.
  ans:
  - To run last?

- que:
  - They need to run first and second?
  ans:
  - Yeah, first and second.

- que:
  - How much you wanna bet?
  ans:
  - You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.

- que:
  - How long you been coming here?
  ans:
  - About six years. My partner took me.

- que:
  - Is it always like this?
  ans:
  - Occasionally you lose.

- que:
  - Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
  ans:
  - Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.

- que:
  - How many have you lost?
  ans:
  - I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.

- que:
  - And what about the ones you don't save?
  ans:
  - You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.

- que:
  - And what if you can't live with it?
  ans:
  - You've got to decide that for yourself.

- que:
  - So what do you want to do?
  ans:
  - That's a chance I gotta take.

- que:
  - McCall, you all right?
  ans:
  - I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...

- que:
  - Have you evacuated anyone?
  ans:
  - Only that floor.

- que:
  - Is the hostage injured?
  ans:
  - Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.

- que:
  - Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
  ans:
  - I ain't interested in your life story.

- que:
  - Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
  ans:
  - I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.

- que:
  - Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
  ans:
  - My name's Scott Roper.

- que:
  - A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels?
  ans:
  - I'm not drunk. Yet.

- que:
  - That a new picture?
  ans:
  - About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.

- que:
  - I've proved that, didn't I?
  ans:
  - Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.

- que:
  - What do you want from me?
  ans:
  - Something I guess I can't have anymore.

- que:
  - You think I didn't need you?
  ans:
  - If you did, you never showed it.

- que:
  - You got a bet on the game tonight?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact, I do.

- que:
  - That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
  ans:
  - No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.

- que:
  - What do you think?
  ans:
  - Mmm, needs a little something.

- que:
  - What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
  ans:
  - It's okay. We broke up.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Just now.

- que:
  - How's Paco doing?
  ans:
  - He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.

- que:
  - You like this place?
  ans:
  - It's very nice.

- que:
  - There is?
  ans:
  - For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - ...Let me just show you.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - I've been thinking.

- que:
  - Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - A deeper level?
  ans:
  - That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...

- que:
  - I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.

- que:
  - Depends. What's up?
  ans:
  - There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.

- que:
  - What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
  ans:
  - Your concern is heartwarming.

- que:
  - Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
  ans:
  - His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.

- que:
  - What do you think would be in order?
  ans:
  - Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars.

- que:
  - What happened to your Trans Am?
  ans:
  - Repoed this morning.

- que:
  - Who's running it?
  ans:
  - Roper...

- que:
  - What do we got?
  ans:
  - 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.

- que:
  - What have you promised them?
  ans:
  - Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

- que:
  - Are these yours?
  ans:
  - Yeah, they are but...

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.

- que:
  - What do you need?
  ans:
  - I need to take back what's mine.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To live forever.

- que:
  - How come I can't remember?
  ans:
  - Because I took it out of your memory.

- que:
  - I'm serious, how did you know my name?
  ans:
  - You were right.

- que:
  - Someone who believes in miracles.
  ans:
  - About what?

- que:
  - You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Guests?
  ans:
  - Just like you always wanted.

- que:
  - What's happening?
  ans:
  - Nothing, go back to sleep.

- que:
  - True. But why?
  ans:
  - Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out. So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.

- que:
  - Then what?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Not real?
  ans:
  - You were the one who was dying.

- que:
  - Where the hell are you going?
  ans:
  - Unfinished business.

- que:
  - And what about the reconfiguration?
  ans:
  - Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.

- que:
  - You sure he's going to come?
  ans:
  - It's his nature.

- que:
  - How long 'till we can eject?
  ans:
  - We're going to have to reconfigure.

- que:
  - How long?
  ans:
  - At least a day.

- que:
  - What about the customers with reservations?
  ans:
  - Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers. But remember, it's a capacity problem. That's all.

- que:
  - Where you plugged-in from?
  ans:
  - New York.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The weather.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The woman you're stuck on.

- que:
  - Doesn't make sense. How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
  ans:
  - Sorry, I just design the maze. Keeping the keys secure is your job.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The truth.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't say.

- que:
  - Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
  ans:
  - Good question.

- que:
  - What did he tell you?
  ans:
  - The truth.

- que:
  - Why would I do that?
  ans:
  - To hide the evidence.

- que:
  - Then where is she?
  ans:
  - Come on Tanner, think this through.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Times Square.

- que:
  - Insurance?
  ans:
  - If she's alive, you get it back.

- que:
  - What brings you inside?
  ans:
  - Cleaning up a mess.

- que:
  - Some things never change, do they?
  ans:
  - I've got to get back.

- que:
  - Someone you have to get back to?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You went to my high-school?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Night City.

- que:
  - Her?
  ans:
  - You said we were on the same programming team.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - It was a test.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - To see how long it would take for me to realize.

- que:
  - Realize?
  ans:
  - You weren't real.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Way you kiss me.

- que:
  - What's the difference?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
  ans:
  - Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.

- que:
  - What's so funny?
  ans:
  - This. No point to it.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Because you'll never believe me.

- que:
  - There?
  ans:
  - My uni-net account. I log on. The program's there.

  - How can we reach Phaedos?
  ans:
  - Rangers... I'm afraid you're too late.

- que:
  - So how can we get to it?
  ans:
  - The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...

- que:
  - Now tell me... what do you see?
  ans:
  - ... Let's take a look over there.

- que:
  - Where did it originate?
  ans:
  - I see... a fox

- que:
  - What's a Triac?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - It's... an eagle?
  ans:
  - Look closer.

- que:
  - ... A falcon?
  ans:
  - Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.

- que:
  - And how do we release the power?
  ans:
  - I'm outta here.

  ans:
  - You scare me, Charlie.

- que:
  - Why should I be?
  ans:
  - I had everything. Once.

- que:

  - I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
  ans:
  - Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay.  I guess I'm yours now.

- que:
  - Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
  ans:
  - Back in your head, where he belongs.  No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.

- que:
  - Back? You're sending me back?
  ans:
  - It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the \"Family Circus\" guy instead.

- que:
  - Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
  ans:
  - He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.

- que:
  - But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
  ans:
  - At the moment, yes.

- que:
  - Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
  ans:
  - Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...

- que:
  - I think it's a pig hair.  How much is McDonald's offering?
  ans:
  - Less.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get People to cover it.

- que:
  - You're really gonna pop the question?
  ans:
  - I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.

- que:
  - Herb. I have to go.
  ans:
  - Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:

- que:
  - Oh my God...you're proposing?
  ans:
  - ...In some weird way I respect that.

  - He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.  Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
  ans:
  - No. I want to give him more. I want to give him a massive dose.

- que:
  - Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me die.
  ans:
  - What'll it do if they pull the plug?

- que:
  - Uh huh. And?
  ans:
  - Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of here...

- que:
  - I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
  ans:
  - Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?

- que:
  - Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
  ans:
  - Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...

- que:
  - You're Death's brother?
  ans:
  - Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...

- que:
  - Land of Death. How do I get there?
  ans:
  - The monkey, of course. It was his idea.

- que:
  - Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
  ans:
  - You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons?

- que:
  - Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
  ans:
  - Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...

- que:
  - Sure. Why?
  ans:
  - You're acting kind of...odd.

- que:
  - What are you watching?
  ans:
  - Ohhh, nothing.

- que:
  - You sure this is...medically advisable?
  ans:
  - They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.

- que:
  - Stu? Is that you? Where did you go?
  ans:
  - Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.

- que:
  - It looks so...new.
  ans:
  - You're wearing a topcoat, Stu. - Where are your pants?

- que:
  - It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
  ans:
  - But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...

- que:
  - That was especially I have something I have to give you.
  ans:
  - Heirloom? Huh? You want a used ring - ?

- que:
  - Can't you give it to me later?
  ans:
  - I might wake up.

- que:
  - Did we just - hit something?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.

- que:
  - Stu?
  ans:
  - Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - My tail itches.

- que:
  - An hour ago. . I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
  ans:
  - I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.

- que:
  - Kimmy! What's the matter?
  ans:
  - This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and...  I gave the order.

- que:
  - Hypnos?
  ans:
  - Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.

- que:
  - Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to?
  ans:
  - Don't ask where I got it.

- que:
  - How am I gonna get past the guards?
  ans:
  - I'll OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

- que:
  - I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
  ans:
  - My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.

- que:
  - Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?

- que:
  - He?
  ans:
  - Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.

- que:
  - How'd you get in there?
  ans:
  - Stu... It's a party.

- que:
  - Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
  ans:
  - Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.

- que:
  - Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
  ans:
  - No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

- que:
  - Where'd he go?
  ans:
  - You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.

- que:
  - What happened? Did you lose your keys?
  ans:
  - Have a nice day.

- que:
  - My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe. Is that true?
  ans:
  - We like to think so, yeah.

- que:
  - Who told you we deal drugs?
  ans:
  - I'm just concerned about my daughter.

- que:
  - What about yesterday? Kicking that poor boy?
  ans:
  - That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City. We do not allow his kind on this block.

- que:
  - Is there something else I can do for you?
  ans:
  - Well, I'd love to see inside your club.

- que:
  - You want to come inside?
  ans:
  - Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.

- que:
  - So, what do you think?
  ans:
  - Well, once you're inside, it's nice.

- que:
  - That's New York. It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day. You'll get used to it.
  ans:
  - You don't like where I live?

- que:
  - ... What are they all doing there?
  ans:
  - That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.

- que:
  - The motorcycle gang? Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
  ans:
  - I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.

- que:
  - How are you doing sweetheart?
  ans:
  - I'm good.

- que:
  - Dating anyone?
  ans:
  - No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.

- que:
  - Mother, I ...
  ans:
  - What about the fellow in those pictures?

- que:
  - Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
  ans:
  - Oh, that has nothing to do with it.

- que:
  - No, I had a dream about daddy. Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
  ans:
  - Oh, I hope so, dear.

- que:
  - Aaron?
  ans:
  - Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.

- que:
  - It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Mm hmm.

- que:
  - Here you go. I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing. Okay?
  ans:
  - At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.

- que:
  - I love you, Mom. I have to run. You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
  ans:
  - Mm hmm.

- que:
  - It's Marika. Is Paula there?
  ans:
  - She's at work. I'm her mother.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Oh, it was such a big scandal.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - Poor man had to leave town. And I hear that other women came forward.

- que:
  - What does he do?
  ans:
  - He's an organic farmer.

- que:
  - What do you think? I left it on the curb?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. It's my first time in New York. Just a minute.

- que:
  - So, you come here all by yourself?
  ans:
  - Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently ...

  - This way?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Not far. You will be fine. It's still day.

- que:
  - I see. How much?
  ans:
  - Forty-five all total.

- que:
  - Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
  ans:
  - Thirty is base price. Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.

- que:
  - Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen. What's this?
  ans:
  - Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.

- que:
  - Where's the Majority Leader?
  ans:
  - The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's  the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.

- que:
  - Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
  ans:
  - Thanks very much, sonny--

- que:
  - But it *isn't*?
  ans:

  - Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
  ans:
  - Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.

  - Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
  ans:
  - Can't that wait, Hubert?

- que:
  - No wonder--without your dinner.
  ans:
  - Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?

- que:
  - Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
  ans:
  - Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.

- que:
  - Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
  ans:
  - Are you ready for him, Bill?

- que:
  - All right, why?
  ans:
  - Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.

  - Certainly. Step right in.

- que:
  - That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
  ans:
  - A pet shop?

- que:
  - What? Who?
  ans:
  - I yield.

- que:
  - I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
  ans:
  - Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?

  - Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
  ans:

  - Will he *yield*?
  ans:

  - Whose statue is that?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't know in the *day time*.

  ans:
  - Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?

  ans:
  - Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.

- que:
  - My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
  ans:
  - I know--but you--you're going to help.

- que:
  - If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
  ans:
  - Committee.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.

  - Yes, I see that.

  - Good. Where are we?
  ans:
  - The Steering Committee.

  ans:
  - Yes, Senator--*twice*.

- que:
  - Uh--have you? Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
  ans:
  - But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.

- que:
  - He did?
  ans:
  - Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.

- que:
  - Have you always had to--work?
  ans:
  - No complaints.

- que:
  - No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders-- Everybody else calls you just plain \"Saunders.\" Why can't I?
  ans:
  - Go right ahead.

- que:
  - Saunders. That's better. Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
  ans:
  - Terrible, thank you.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.

- que:
  - You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
  ans:
  - Look--I think we ought to skip it.

- que:
  - No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time-- I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
  ans:
  - Must have been tickled pink.

- que:
  - Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
  ans:
  - Contributions from boys who read about your camp.

- que:
  - Already? All these letters?
  ans:
  - Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.

- que:
  - Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
  ans:
  - Splendid.

- que:
  - Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
  ans:
  - I'm splendid, too.

- que:
  - And how's your bill, Senator?
  ans:
  - Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean-- I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit. I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.

- que:
  - How's that, buddy?
  ans:
  - I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.

- que:
  - Yes, *sir*. Let's *go* Henry.
  ans:
  - Oh--you're *sure* of that now?

- que:
  - What! Who?
  ans:
  - That's what he's been doing since last heard from.

- que:
  - What do you mean? What's going on?
  ans:
  - The Head Man's writing a Bill.

- que:
  - Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
  ans:
  - Let's get away from here.

- que:
  - Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
  ans:
  - The ranger's notices? No idea at all.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.

- que:
  - By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
  ans:
  - Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.

- que:
  - How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
  ans:
  - Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.

- que:
  - Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
  ans:
  - I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?

- que:
  - Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
  ans:
  - Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.

- que:
  - Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
  ans:
  - Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.

- que:
  - You won't stand for it?
  ans:
  - Maybe he won't get up.

- que:
  - How nice. How do you do, Senator?
  ans:
  - Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.

- que:
  - Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
  ans:
  - Is there objection? You may proceed, Senator.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - Certainly.

- que:
  - Deeds?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.

- que:
  - Are you married?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Any children?
  ans:
  - No, no children.

- que:
  - No. Are you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
  ans:
  - I haven't.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.

- que:
  - Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
  ans:
  - Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?

- que:
  - Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
  ans:
  - What's that got to do with it?

- que:
  - Feel better now?
  ans:
  - Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh - uh - nothing.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.

- que:
  - I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
  ans:
  - Oh. What's happening about the opera?

- que:
  - What did they say?
  ans:
  - Gosh, you look pretty tonight.

- que:
  - What did they say?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.

- que:
  - Have you seen the papers?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I say, to most people it's a washout.

- que:
  - Now, what do you see?
  ans:
  - There's Times Square.

- que:
  - I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
  ans:
  - Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You said I was a lady in distress.

- que:
  - You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
  ans:
  - I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.

- que:
  - Yeah, I know.
  ans:
  - You have?

- que:
  - What did he play?
  ans:
  - The drums. He taught me to play some.

- que:
  - It had better be good.
  ans:
  - He did?

- que:
  - Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
  ans:
  - No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.

- que:
  - Let's just walk, okay?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - Are you? When?
  ans:
  - In a day or so, I think.

- que:
  - A girl?
  ans:
  - Well, here we are again.

- que:
  - Hello, Mary?
  ans:
  - Oh, hello darling.

- que:
  - What's the matter, hon?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Yeah, then what?
  ans:
  - Search me. Ask the Gypsies.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks. Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.

- que:
  - What'll I tell him if he calls up?
  ans:
  - Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.

- que:
  - Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Have lunch.

- que:
  - Did it?
  ans:
  - I was the world's sweetest ingenue.

- que:
  - Is he really that big a sap?
  ans:
  - He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.

- que:
  - How'd you get the picture?
  ans:
  - Had the boys follow us.

- que:
  - When're you going to see him again?
  ans:
  - Tonight, maybe. I'll phone him at noon. Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.

- que:
  - What's bothering you, huh?
  ans:
  - Last night he proposed to me.

- que:
  - Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
  ans:
  - I'm going to tell him the truth.

- que:
  - Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
  ans:
  - I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.

- que:
  - I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
  ans:
  - That's the rub.

- que:
  - Oh, as bad as that, huh?
  ans:
  - Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.

- que:
  - Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
  ans:
  - I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.

- que:
  - Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Who? Miss Dawson?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - How's it going? Okay?
  ans:
  - Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.

- que:
  - Gold, eh?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Fourteen carat?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Is that the best you've got?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes sir.

- que:
  - Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her. Get a smaller bowl, will you?
  ans:
  - A smaller bowl of flowers.

- que:
  - Stuff, sir?
  ans:
  - That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.

- que:
  - Me sir?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
  ans:
  - How is this, sir?

- que:
  - Come on, John. What happened?
  ans:
  - The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.

- que:
  - Nuisance value?
  ans:
  - They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.

- que:
  - Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
  ans:
  - Nuisance value. Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?

- que:
  - What was that you said he was?
  ans:
  - Wants to know who the heir is.

- que:
  - Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
  ans:
  - I guess we'd better try somebody else.

- que:
  - You can't?
  ans:
  - I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

- que:
  - Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
  ans:
  - Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.

- que:
  - Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Are your parents living?
  ans:
  - Why, no.

- que:
  - Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
  ans:
  - Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.

- que:
  - Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
  ans:
  - Who - me? No.

- que:
  - What for?
  ans:
  - You're going to New York with us.

- que:
  - Will you have a cigar?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.

- que:
  - Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
  ans:
  - Oh - nothing. No extra charge.

- que:
  - That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I mean, about the Power of Attorney.

- que:
  - Why not? Who is he?
  ans:
  - A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.

- que:
  - Is Mr. Deeds in?
  ans:
  - No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine. Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.

- que:
  - Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
  ans:
  - No, thanks.

- que:
  - That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
  ans:
  - No, I'm his housekeeper.

- que:
  - Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
  ans:
  - He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.

- que:
  - Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
  ans:
  - Nah.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.

- que:
  - Have a drink?
  ans:
  - No, thanks.

- que:
  - You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from \"Lucia.\"
  ans:
  - Thanks Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?

- que:
  - Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Only common sense.
  ans:
  - That's funny. Why is that?

- que:
  - Women! Ever heard of 'em?
  ans:
  - He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.

- que:
  - What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
  ans:
  - And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.

- que:
  - I don't remember. \"Cinderella Man!\" What do they mean by that?
  ans:
  - They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.

- que:
  - But what about this \"Cinderella Man\"?
  ans:
  - Yes, I guess I'll have to.

- que:
  - You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
  ans:
  - They can have the Estate.

- que:
  - Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
  ans:
  - Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.

- que:
  - Well, maybe I will have a sandwich. Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
  ans:
  - Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.

- que:
  - I'm Chairman?
  ans:
  - Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.

- que:
  - Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
  ans:
  - Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.

- que:
  - We own an opera house, don't we?
  ans:
  - We provide opera.

- que:
  - But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
  ans:
  - Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.

- que:
  - Now, where were we?
  ans:
  - You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.

- que:
  - Uh-huh.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.

- que:
  - It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
  ans:
  - Ja.

- que:
  - It takes so long to detect them because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
  ans:
  - Let him alone.

- que:
  - Mrs. Semple?
  ans:
  - Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.

- que:
  - What kind of wife did you say she was?
  ans:
  - Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.

- que:
  - A child? My uncle's?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
  ans:
  - You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.

- que:
  - What about it, Mr. Deeds?
  ans:
  - Why, I turned them down, naturally.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - I say we don't want to appear greedy.

- que:
  - And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
  ans:
  - Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.

- que:
  - One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
  ans:
  - Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.

- que:
  - Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
  ans:
  - Well, I play the tuba.

- que:
  - You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
  ans:
  - Look, he's temperamental.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil. I was watching you.

- que:
  - Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
  ans:
  - No. Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.

- que:
  - Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Oh, the poet? Where?
  ans:
  - Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.

- que:
  - Binge?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
  ans:
  - Don't pay any attention to her.

- que:
  - Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
  ans:
  - I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.

- que:
  - What is your name?
  ans:
  - Christian Svenson.

- que:
  - Farmer?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am.

- que:
  - Where is your farm?
  ans:
  - South Dakota north.

- que:
  - South Dakota - north?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.

- que:
  - You mean by the neck or something?
  ans:
  - Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.

- que:
  - Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.

- que:
  - It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.

- que:
  - Tails tonight, sir?
  ans:
  - What - tails? Why, that's a monkey suit! Do you want people to laugh at me? I never wore one of those things in my life.

- que:
  - What do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - Why, I'm assisting you, sir.

- que:
  - Excuse me. What did you say?
  ans:
  - He talks about women as if they were cattle.

- que:
  - Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
  ans:
  - Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.

- que:
  - Twenty! What did he do with them?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Prairie? Oysters?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.

- que:
  - Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet?
  ans:
  - Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.

- que:
  - Looking for?
  ans:
  - You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.

- que:
  - You try it.
  ans:
  - What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?

- que:
  - Me, sir?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Me more than most.
  ans:
  - Shall I call the police, sir?

- que:
  - Why are they ganging up against me?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.

- que:
  - They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that?
  ans:
  - Good kids.

- que:
  - Hmm?
  ans:
  - I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.

- que:
  - One hundred books?
  ans:
  - It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - You must have been concerned.

- que:
  - Doubtful. What did he say?
  ans:
  - I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --

- que:
  - \"There's no shame in getting a little therapy\", right, Doc?
  ans:
  - Dr. Mumford.

- que:
  - Could you come with me please?
  ans:
  - I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

- que:
  - That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
  ans:
  - No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.

- que:
  - Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
  ans:
  - Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.

- que:
  - I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
  ans:
  - Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.

- que:
  - Were you supposed to have a session?
  ans:
  - No. It's sort of spur of the moment.

- que:
  - A friend?
  ans:
  - Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.

- que:
  - You're the shrink, aren't you?
  ans:
  - No, not really.

- que:
  - But you do therapy?
  ans:
  - I think he's got a point.

- que:
  - So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
  ans:
  - But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.

- que:
  - Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
  ans:
  - Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...

- que:
  - Right now?
  ans:
  - I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.

- que:
  - Are we?
  ans:
  - My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.

- que:
  - Interesting approach. What was his name?
  ans:
  - Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.

- que:
  - What kind of doubts?
  ans:
  - I see.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Stop now.

- que:
  - You find it distasteful, don't you?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.

- que:
  - Where's your wife, Henry?
  ans:
  - Go to hell.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - You are so mean.

- que:
  - What is it?
  ans:
  - It's a thought I had.

- que:
  - Should I open it now?
  ans:
  - Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.

- que:
  - But you did come to me.
  ans:
  - What exactly is it supposed to do?

- que:
  - And the experiment is in here?
  ans:
  - My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.

- que:
  - Do you want to come in?
  ans:
  - I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

- que:
  - I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
  ans:
  - I've had my moments.

- que:
  - Althea hasn't told you?
  ans:
  - We've been talking about her, mostly.

- que:
  - We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. So what do you think?
  ans:
  - Tastes good.

- que:
  - What do you think's wrong with her?
  ans:
  - She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.

- que:
  - You're the doctor, what do you think?
  ans:
  - She seems very unhappy.

- que:
  - Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
  ans:
  - I do.

- que:
  - ...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
  ans:
  - Yes, your honor.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry you're frustrated.

- que:
  - Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
  ans:
  - No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.

- que:
  - So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
  ans:
  - I'd better get in there.

- que:
  - What are they?
  ans:
  - Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
  ans:
  - My patient had to leave early.

- que:
  - Does the phrase \"nosy\" have any meaning to you, Lily?
  ans:
  - I think it's like... inquisitive.

- que:
  - What do you want to know?
  ans:
  - You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.

- que:
  - How long you been in this town?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know...

- que:
  - You like me. How come?
  ans:
  - Not sure. Let me think about it.

- que:
  - Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. Nice car. How's that place?
  ans:
  - It's a pretty piece of land.

- que:
  - Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
  ans:
  - It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.

- que:
  - ...And?
  ans:
  - Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.

- que:
  - Why do you watch?
  ans:
  - They come through a few times each year. Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! It's a tour.

- que:
  - Where am I supposed to eat?
  ans:
  - You're on your own today, honey.

- que:
  - ...so rich?
  ans:
  - ...so accomplished.

- que:
  - I want to give you something. Will you let me?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.

- que:
  - That's it? That's what you're giving me?
  ans:
  - Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.

- que:
  - Thanks for your help, Lionel.
  ans:
  - Don't you at least have a back door I can use?

- que:
  - But you know how to drive?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Got a license? But no car?
  ans:
  - Don't need it.

- que:
  - Can you help Mom?
  ans:
  - I'm trying.

- que:
  - Is she a friend of yours?
  ans:
  - No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better. Let's go, Vanessa.

- que:
  - What's happening here?
  ans:
  - We're going for a walk.

- que:
  - Do you think that's a good idea?
  ans:
  - Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.

- que:
  - What kind of doctor are you?
  ans:
  - It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.

- que:
  - What'd you want?
  ans:
  - There's something I think we need to talk about.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Finally, some common sense...

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I think you know what I mean.

- que:
  - Why don't you tell me?
  ans:
  - Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.

- que:
  - Could I see Sofie, please?
  ans:
  - No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.

- que:
  - You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
  ans:
  - Hmm.

- que:
  - Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
  ans:
  - Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.

- que:
  - What would you do?
  ans:
  - We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.

- que:
  - You have the best answer for everything. You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
  ans:
  - No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.

- que:
  - Can I ask you something? Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient? So what changed?
  ans:
  - I'm not making any promises.

- que:
  - Is she against you getting help?
  ans:
  - We don't discuss it.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? Just kidding.

- que:
  - Is this the treatment?
  ans:
  - Sorry... I'm done.

- que:
  - Sore throat?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Painful lymph glands? Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
  ans:
  - Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Life.

- que:
  - Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe?
  ans:
  - No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.

- que:
  - So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
  ans:
  - I can give myself a headache instantly.

- que:
  - There... I've given myself a real whopper.
  ans:
  - Is that like a party trick?

- que:
  - That was really bad, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Disgusting.

- que:
  - Is that when you split up?
  ans:
  - No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.

- que:
  - So whose route is this?
  ans:
  - Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.

- que:
  - You like it?
  ans:
  - It's all right.

- que:
  - And this is legitimate therapy?
  ans:
  - Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.

- que:
  - Which thing?
  ans:
  - Either one.

- que:
  - Why'd you come to the house the other night?
  ans:
  - I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.

- que:
  - That's... good?
  ans:
  - I don't know if --

- que:
  - I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Is something wrong, Sofie?
  ans:
  - Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.

- que:
  - Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
  ans:
  - Um-huh.

- que:
  - The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
  ans:
  - I think so.

- que:
  - Transference.
  ans:
  - What was that?

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hello.

- que:
  - Which show was that?
  ans:
  - Sofie...

- que:
  - ...How violated I feel?
  ans:
  - You're not the only one...

- que:
  - You feel violated?
  ans:
  - Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.

- que:
  - Will you think about it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.

- que:
  - What is your name?
  ans:
  - You got off easy.

- que:
  - Will you wait for me?
  ans:
  - We're only talking about six weeks.

- que:
  - Will you be here?
  ans:
  - Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.

- que:
  - What do you mean, \"in no time\"?
  ans:
  - In maybe three or four issues.

- que:
  - Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
  ans:
  - Don't do that thing... ...that shrink thing.

- que:
  - The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
  ans:
  - It's called pro bono.

- que:
  - Pro boner? Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
  ans:
  - It's my bit for the community.

- que:
  - Have women found you attractive?
  ans:
  - That's not quite what I said --

- que:
  - What do you want me to see?
  ans:
  - Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.

- que:
  - Was it something that happened at school?
  ans:
  - These appointments were not my idea, remember.

- que:
  - True. Should we stop them?
  ans:
  - I don't think you know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - Do you think that's what he wants?
  ans:
  - What'd he say?

- que:
  - No again?
  ans:
  - I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.

- que:
  - He agreed?
  ans:
  - You're Doc Mumford. Skip Skipperton.

- que:
  - How are you?
  ans:
  - Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.

- que:
  - Would you like another beer?
  ans:
  - Nah... scotch.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a personal question?
  ans:
  - Of course! That's exactly what I want.

- que:
  - Is that the question?
  ans:
  - You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right? Far out.

- que:
  - I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
  ans:
  - Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.

- que:
  - Don't you like this?
  ans:
  - Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.

- que:
  - Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
  ans:
  - No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.

- que:
  - Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
  ans:
  - What kind of person do you have to be to do this?

- que:
  - That's all right. What's on your mind?
  ans:
  - How many sessions have we had now, Doc? Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.

- que:
  - You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
  ans:
  - It's just a thought.

- que:
  - Okay... let's say that, for now.
  ans:
  - Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --

- que:
  - Slash what?
  ans:
  - Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.

- que:
  - No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
  ans:
  - Sounds like kind of a good idea.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Definitely.

- que:
  - Who else knows?
  ans:
  - Just you.

- que:
  - Damn! What is your name?
  ans:
  - Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.

- que:
  - What about everything? How did this happen?
  ans:
  - Everybody has a story, Skip.

- que:
  - An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
  ans:
  - It wasn't the best situation.

- que:
  - Did you carry a gun?
  ans:
  - Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.

- que:
  - And the drugs?
  ans:
  - Somebody's taking a shower down there.

- que:
  - And a birth certificate is enough?
  ans:
  - Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.

- que:
  - But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
  ans:
  - No... no training.

- que:
  - Psych major?
  ans:
  - English Lit.

- que:
  - This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
  ans:
  - There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.

- que:
  - What'd I do?
  ans:
  - Lily... ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.

- que:
  - Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
  ans:
  - It's possible. I don't know about that.

- que:
  - You know where he's taking her?
  ans:
  - Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.

- que:
  - Who the hell are these guys?
  ans:
  - Priests. Imhotep's priests.

- que:
  - And what ritual would that be?
  ans:
  - The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.

- que:
  - And how does one do that?
  ans:
  - By reading the Book Of The Dead.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - If he arrives before us, it will be too late.

- que:
  - Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
  ans:
  - Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

- que:
  - None of the above, thank you.
  ans:
  - In the desert? What for?

- que:
  - Then what the hell are you doing here!?
  ans:
  - My very good friend! What a surprise.

- que:
  - I've had worse.
  ans:
  - Let's make us even, shall we?

- que:
  - C'mon, friend.
  ans:
  - Goin' somewhere?

- que:
  - Why do you like to fight so much?
  ans:
  - Cause I look good doin, it.

- que:
  - Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
  ans:
  - You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.

- que:
  - Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy?
  ans:
  - This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.

- que:
  - Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
  ans:
  - The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.

- que:
  - Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
  ans:
  - He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.

- que:
  - Where's your new friend?
  ans:
  - What friend? You're my only friend.

- que:
  - Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
  ans:
  - It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.

- que:
  - Immune from what?
  ans:
  - You shall see.

- que:
  - What does he want the book for?
  ans:
  - Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... And your sister.

- que:
  - Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
  ans:
  - That's one way of putting it.

- que:
  - What just happened?
  ans:
  - All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, always.

- que:
  - ...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
  ans:
  - Intestines.

- que:
  - When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
  ans:
  - See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.

- que:
  - No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
  ans:
  - What is he doing here?

- que:
  - The key!? She has the lost key!?
  ans:
  - Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.

- que:
  - Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
  ans:
  - I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.

- que:
  - Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
  ans:
  - So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --

- que:
  - Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
  ans:
  - You think it'll send this guy back to hell?

- que:
  - Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
  ans:
  - The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.

- que:
  - The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
  ans:
  - Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

- que:
  - And what is he in prison for?
  ans:
  - I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.

- que:
  - And what did he say?
  ans:
  - He said... he was just looking for a good time.

- que:
  - Where are they taking him?
  ans:
  - Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.

- que:
  - What are you doing here?
  ans:
  - I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.

- que:
  - No.
  ans:
  - So who's the broad?

- que:
  - No?
  ans:
  - No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

- que:
  - How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
  ans:
  - Because that's where I found it. I was there.

- que:
  - Yeah, I was there.
  ans:
  - You were actually at Hamunaptra?

- que:
  - You swear?
  ans:
  - Every damn day.

- que:
  - What did you find? What did you see?
  ans:
  - I found sand. I saw death.

- que:
  - Want to know?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
  ans:
  - Really want to know?

- que:
  - Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
  ans:
  - If you call that a kiss.

- que:
  - Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
  ans:
  - The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.

- que:
  - Ahmar is Ossirion. \"Passageway to the underworld\", actually.
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?

- que:
  - And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
  ans:
  - You know your history.

- que:
  - Can you swim?
  ans:
  - Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - We're about to be shown the way.

- que:
  - What are those mirrors for?
  ans:
  - Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

- que:
  - Preparation for what?
  ans:
  - For entering the afterlife.

- que:
  - Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
  ans:
  - They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.

- que:
  - There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
  ans:
  - Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

- que:
  - Who was talking about what?
  ans:
  - Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.

- que:
  - I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
  ans:
  - I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.

- que:
  - And what is that?
  ans:
  - I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.

- que:
  - I'm not?
  ans:
  - Not unless you call me Rick.

- que:
  - Why would I do that?
  ans:
  - Because that's my name.

- que:
  - No... Why?... Should I?
  ans:
  - Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.

- que:
  - Is he supposed to look like that?
  ans:
  - No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...

- que:
  - Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
  ans:
  - Very slowly.

- que:
  - That bad huh?
  ans:
  - The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.

- que:
  - You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
  ans:
  - It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.

- que:
  - It's everybody's problem!
  ans:
  - Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

- que:
  - That's what I am to you? A contract?
  ans:
  - Don't do it, Evelyn.

- que:
  - Have you no respect for the dead?
  ans:
  - Right now, I only wish to join them.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I think you found something.

- que:
  - Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
  ans:
  - I'm your sister.

- que:
  - But he's just a filthy criminal?
  ans:
  - Way to go, Evy.

- que:
  - Do you really think he'll show up?
  ans:
  - Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.

- que:
  - Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
  ans:
  - After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.

- que:
  - Did you ever see him eat?
  ans:
  - I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.

- que:
  - Juicy?
  ans:
  - Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.

- que:
  - Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
  ans:
  - Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?

- que:
  - Hey,... don't I know you?
  ans:
  - Um, well, you see...

- que:
  - Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Awfully.

- que:
  - And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
  ans:
  - OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

- que:
  - You did not!?... We're not!?
  ans:
  - We gotta get her back.

- que:
  - Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
  ans:
  - I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.

- que:
  - But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...

- que:
  - I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
  ans:
  - Um-hmm.

- que:
  - And what's that?
  ans:
  - That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.

- que:
  - What --?
  ans:
  - Everything's going exactly as we planned.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Head hunting.

- que:
  - What are you doing all alone in the dark?
  ans:
  - Fantasizing... about you.

- que:
  - I thought you were done?
  ans:
  - One last tweak.

- que:
  - Do I?
  ans:
  - The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.

- que:
  - So who killed him?
  ans:
  - The Disco Boys.

- que:
  - When was that?
  ans:
  - Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm the Bowler.

- que:
  - The Inscrutable Six?
  ans:
  - But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.

- que:
  - Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
  ans:
  - I thought you'd never ask.

- que:
  - What did he mean?
  ans:
  - I dunno.

- que:
  - Hey... you okay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - How's your dad?
  ans:
  - He's dead.

- que:
  - Have you considered my offer?
  ans:
  - I got it.

- que:
  - What about Captain Amazing?
  ans:
  - Superheroes.

- que:
  - Why bother?
  ans:
  - That boy's got talent.

- que:
  - Captain who?
  ans:
  - You're nuts.

- que:
  - Are you with me... or against me?
  ans:
  - Against.

- que:
  - Are you an actress?
  ans:
  - Just a waitress.

- que:
  - I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
  ans:
  - Sure -- I guess.

- que:
  - Who's the artist?
  ans:
  - Me.

- que:
  - Then why are you here?
  ans:
  - Curiosity.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I saw him walk you home.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Not tonight.

- que:
  - Alone tonight?
  ans:
  - Every night.

- que:
  - Date?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.

- que:
  - Who wouldn't?
  ans:
  - I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.

- que:
  - What's your real name?
  ans:
  - Roy.

- que:
  - Have you always lived here?
  ans:
  - Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.

- que:
  - What have they got that we ain't got?
  ans:
  - Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.

- que:
  - Monica, where are you?
  ans:
  - At the Frankenstein Center.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Bye.

- que:
  - So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
  ans:
  - Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.

- que:
  - Good or evil, what's the difference?
  ans:
  - You're the Sphinx.

- que:
  - When are you going to take off that mask?
  ans:
  - When I am sure I am among friends.

- que:
  - What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
  ans:
  - Good point.

- que:
  - You sure that's how you spell it?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Are you coming or not?
  ans:
  - I'll drive.

- que:
  - Nah.
  ans:
  - Why not?

- que:
  - Who's chicken?
  ans:
  - Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

- que:
  - Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
  ans:
  - He hasn't stolen it yet.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - But... only when no one is looking.

- que:
  - So you're only invisible... to yourself?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Anybody got any?
  ans:
  - Yes, Obie-wan.

- que:
  - You guys going to a costume party?
  ans:
  - We're superheroes.

- que:
  - Are you famous?
  ans:
  - Not yet.

- que:
  - So you're like... struggling superheroes?
  ans:
  - We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.

- que:
  - So what can I get you?
  ans:
  - Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw.

- que:
  - What are you doing in the silver drawer?
  ans:
  - I use it... to fight evil.

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - I always knew that you were special.

- que:
  - You did?
  ans:
  - Ever since you were a little boy... Come with me.

- que:
  - Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
  ans:
  - We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

- que:
  - How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - Who are they?
  ans:
  - The Disco Boys.

- que:
  - Do we have to?
  ans:
  - I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.

- que:
  - The who?
  ans:
  - He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.

- que:
  - Whatever our name is.
  ans:
  - Yeah, but how do we get to them?

- que:
  - The bazookas?
  ans:
  - Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.

- que:
  - But how do we get in?
  ans:
  - That was too close.

- que:
  - Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
  ans:
  - I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.

- que:
  - Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
  ans:
  - I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.

- que:
  - What do you think Napoleon will do?
  ans:
  - I think it's absolutely charming.

- que:
  - Whatever suggested the idea to you?
  ans:
  - I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.

- que:
  - Yes -- who spoke up?
  ans:
  - I did, sir.

- que:
  - Yes, Captain? Have you anything you wish to say?
  ans:
  - Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.

- que:
  - May I come to the map?
  ans:
  - Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in. Please sit down.

- que:
  - Thank you for coming. Would you care for a drink?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - What do you have in mind?
  ans:
  - To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - I don't even know whether a defense is possible.

- que:
  - What forces do you have at your disposal?
  ans:
  - About 5,000 troops.

- que:
  - Cavalry?
  ans:
  - The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.

- que:
  - Any cannon?
  ans:
  - There are none here.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.

- que:
  - Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
  ans:
  - Properly arranged, yes.

- que:
  - Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
  ans:
  - In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.

- que:
  - Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy?
  ans:
  - They are at the gates of Paris, sire.

- que:
  - And where is the army?
  ans:
  - It is on this road, sire, following me.

- que:
  - And who is defending Paris?
  ans:
  - Paris is evacuated, sire. The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. The National Guard is on duty at the gates.

- que:
  - Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
  ans:
  - I don't know, sire.

- que:
  - And where is Joseph?
  ans:
  - I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.

- que:
  - But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
  ans:
  - I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.

- que:
  - Who is there?
  ans:
  - Bertrand, sire.

- que:
  - Yes, sire?
  ans:
  - No, sire... I was asleep.

- que:
  - General Bonaparte?
  ans:
  - Come back in an hour.

- que:
  - Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Was the trip normal in every respect?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
  ans:
  - No, sir, none at all.

- que:
  - Yes, sir?
  ans:
  - A glass of champagne, please.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am.

- que:
  - Bastia -- and you?
  ans:
  - Ajaccio.

- que:
  - Have you been back recently?
  ans:
  - I haven't been there for three years.

- que:
  - I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
  ans:
  - No, they're living in Nice now.

- que:
  - That's a nice city. This is your first time here, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

- que:
  - You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
  ans:
  - Ah-hh, no.

- que:
  - Why are you carrying the dog?
  ans:
  - His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.

- que:
  - When you eat him, may I have some?
  ans:
  - My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog? I would rather eat Cossack.

- que:
  - My God...! What time is it?
  ans:
  - The first reports came in at about ten.

- que:
  - Why didn't you wake me then?
  ans:
  - At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.

- que:
  - How did it spread so quickly?
  ans:
  - It is the work of incendiaries.

- que:
  - Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
  ans:
  - Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.

- que:
  - Indeed you have, Ambassador. Have you sent for a doctor?
  ans:
  - I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.

- que:
  - But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
  ans:
  - No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.

- que:
  - I have met her. What is your business with me?
  ans:
  - I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.

- que:
  - And he sent you to me?
  ans:
  - He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.

- que:
  - Does your mother know you have come?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected. How do you expect me to find yours?
  ans:
  - Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.

- que:
  - Shall we move closer to the fire?
  ans:
  - Yes -- an excellent idea.

- que:
  - Will Alexander be joining us soon?
  ans:
  - I very much doubt that he will.

- que:
  - Oh...?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.

- que:
  - Would you like some brandy?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
  ans:
  - No -- not as a rule.

- que:
  - The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is. It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.

- que:
  - Then what brings you out on such a night?
  ans:
  - Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.

- que:
  - One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
  ans:
  - No, I'm only here on leave. My regiment is at Valence.

- que:
  - Are you staying with a friend, sir?
  ans:
  - No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.

- que:
  - Is it a nice warm room, sir?
  ans:
  - Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.

- que:
  - Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
  ans:
  - Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.

- que:
  - Do you have three francs, sir?
  ans:
  - Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Lisette.

- que:
  - Only Lisette?
  ans:
  - Lisette La Croix.

- que:
  - That's a very nice name. Where are you from?
  ans:
  - Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.

- que:
  - Junot?
  ans:
  - No... nothing at all.

- que:
  - You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - Yes, of course, I would. You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.

- que:
  - And you, Junot?
  ans:
  - The important thing is to find the right lawyer. One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.

- que:
  - Are you trying to insult me?
  ans:
  - Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.

- que:
  - When is she supposed to return?
  ans:
  - She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.

- que:
  - Oh... I see. I understand. How is... the Emperor?
  ans:
  - I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.

- que:
  - Oh... yes, of course! Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
  ans:
  - Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.

- que:
  - May I offer you a drink?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.

- que:
  - Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.

- que:
  - Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
  ans:
  - I thought I was. I was confused.

- que:
  - And now?
  ans:
  - Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.

- que:
  - Do you expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And you, are you in love with any one else?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Were you in love with any of them?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Were they pretty?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Were any of them prettier than I am?
  ans:
  - One had better legs.

- que:
  - Were any of them married?
  ans:
  - Yes. They were the easiest. I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.

- que:
  - Yes -- what is it?
  ans:
  - Open the door. It's me.

- que:
  - Where is Madame Trillaud?
  ans:
  - How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.

- que:
  - What are you doing in there?
  ans:
  - Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous! If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.

- que:
  - Will you be joining us, soon?
  ans:
  - I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests.

- que:
  - Separate bedrooms?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Not be safe? What on earth are you talking about?
  ans:
  - In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.

- que:
  - Who is it?
  ans:
  - It's me.

- que:
  - God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
  ans:
  - There's probably some explanation.

- que:
  - Why did you give it to him?
  ans:
  - I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.

- que:
  - I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
  ans:
  - He's downstairs -- somewhere.

- que:
  - Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
  ans:
  - Certainly.

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Nothing. That's all I can say.

- que:
  - That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yes, I wrote it.

- que:
  - You couldn't face telling me what?
  ans:
  - About Hippolyte Charles.

- que:
  - Do you know what you're saying?
  ans:
  - God help me -- yes.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I know.

- que:
  - How do you know?
  ans:
  - I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.

- que:
  - You could hear them?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You mean you heard them making love?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How did you know it was Captain Charles?
  ans:
  - I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.

- que:
  - And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
  ans:
  - I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.

- que:
  - Good day, monsieur. Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
  ans:
  - My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.

- que:
  - If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
  ans:
  - If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.

- que:
  - And, where did you see my portrait?
  ans:
  - Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.

- que:
  - And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
  ans:
  - You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.

- que:
  - Do you like music?
  ans:
  - Yes, I do -- very much.

- que:
  - You are so good to me. Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
  ans:
  - You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.

- que:
  - Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
  ans:
  - Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.

- que:
  - Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Does she deserve anything better?
  ans:
  - Those are extremely harsh terms.

- que:
  - Has Alexander agreed to this?
  ans:
  - Yes, he has.

- que:
  - Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
  ans:
  - England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria. A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.

- que:
  - And where do you place Alexander?
  ans:
  - Alexander and I are friends. We have reached an understanding.

- que:
  - I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot. Do you know him, monsieur?
  ans:
  - Very well, Citizen Lieutenant. You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.

- que:
  - What did you say his name was?
  ans:
  - Eugene de Beauharnais.

- que:
  - Is he alone?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.

- que:
  - And I can go free?
  ans:
  - Go, fo' I change my mind.

- que:
  - Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
  ans:
  - Naw, it ain't like that.

- que:
  - You know me? I would've shot his big ass. Hey, Willie, how's it going? Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
  ans:
  - Thanks, Unc.

- que:
  - It's cool, but where's the water?
  ans:
  - Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.

- que:
  - Y'all never use it?
  ans:
  - Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.

- que:
  - Why you say that?
  ans:
  - Cause your lips is getting black.

- que:
  - Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
  ans:
  - Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?

- que:
  - Me, too. You think they're in there?
  ans:
  - Yup.

- que:
  - Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm his cousin.

- que:
  - Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I think he went out the back.

- que:
  - Where you going?
  ans:
  - Ain't the rest room this way? I gotta pee.

- que:
  - What you mean talk to her?
  ans:
  - You know what he mean, dude.

- que:
  - That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
  ans:
  - Naw, I already ate.

- que:
  - Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do that?
  ans:
  - Black magic.

- que:
  - What about the dog?
  ans:
  - Dude, dogs hate me. I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.

- que:
  - Fuck, what's his name?
  ans:
  - Cheeco.

- que:
  - Whatever you say, man. I didn't see shit. The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
  ans:
  - Shut up! Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass! What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?

- que:
  - What's crackin'?
  ans:
  - You. Hi, Uncle Willie.

- que:
  - Who is that?
  ans:
  - Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.

- que:
  - This you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's me. Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.

- que:
  - Oh, yeah, where you work at?
  ans:
  - Thanks for reminding me.

- que:
  - Yeah, I'm alright. Is my face still orange to you?
  ans:
  - Just a little.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.

- que:
  - Restraining order? Where the hell you meet this girl?
  ans:
  - I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way. Worst day of my life.

- que:
  - You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
  ans:
  - You don't know Baby D.

- que:
  - Who is that?
  ans:
  - That's the sister.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - So.

- que:
  - What you mean, so?
  ans:
  - If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that.

- que:
  - You walked?
  ans:
  - Yeah, ya'll got a notice today. It came certified mail.

- que:
  - You know what this is?
  ans:
  - Yeah, that's why I walked down here.

- que:
  - I don't know. Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
  ans:
  - It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.

- que:
  - Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
  ans:
  - $247.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.

- que:
  - You shot her?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Who did?
  ans:
  - I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - And your husband works for somebody else.

- que:
  - What the hell are you saying?
  ans:
  - I knew you wouldn't believe me.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For not believing you.

- que:
  - Can we go now?
  ans:
  - Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.

  ans:
  - Good luck.

  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Daddy?
  ans:
  - Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.

- que:
  - What's your point?
  ans:
  - I will do no such thing.

- que:
  - Where did you get these? Who are you?
  ans:
  - I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.

- que:
  - Are you 'fucking with me!?
  ans:
  - The gun...

- que:
  - What about the gun?
  ans:
  - It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.

- que:
  - What...?
  ans:
  - Tell me why I miss him.

- que:
  - He's dead?
  ans:
  - That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.

- que:
  - How should I...?
  ans:
  - Tell me why he's dead.

- que:
  - Do you now, Mr. Watson?
  ans:
  - I kill her - and you kill me.

- que:
  - Come back.
  ans:
  - How am I supposed to get away?

- que:
  - How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
  ans:
  - Again.

- que:
  - What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
  ans:
  - You know what I'm gonna do.

- que:
  - He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
  ans:
  - What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him. We will.

- que:
  - Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
  ans:
  - I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.

- que:
  - I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
  ans:
  - Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.

- que:
  - Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
  ans:
  - On TV.

- que:
  - So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
  ans:
  - No way.

- que:
  - Ready?
  ans:
  - Nods.

- que:
  - Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

- que:
  - Can we go now?
  ans:
  - Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.

- que:
  - No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
  ans:
  - All right.

- que:
  - Will you promise me that?
  ans:
  - I promise.

- que:
  - What do you do, if I may be so bold?
  ans:
  - I'm just an accountant.

- que:
  - You got anything smaller?
  ans:
  - Keep it.

- que:
  - Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
  ans:
  - Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.

- que:
  - You remember me?
  ans:
  - I remember. The big tipper.

- que:
  - Mister, what are you dragging me into?
  ans:
  - I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...

- que:
  - This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - What are you supposed to do?
  ans:
  - Kill the Governor.

- que:
  - I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
  ans:
  - One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The Governor. If I could just talk to her...

- que:
  - Then why'd you drag me into it?
  ans:
  - It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.

- que:
  - Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - Keep the change.

- que:
  - What am I supposed to say to her?
  ans:
  - It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What are you going to do!?
  ans:
  - This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.

- que:
  - You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
  ans:
  - Fuckin' A.

- que:
  - Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
  ans:
  - It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.

- que:
  - Could I see it?
  ans:
  - You stole that.

- que:
  - Everybody does?
  ans:
  - Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.

- que:
  - My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
  ans:
  - That's pretty good.

- que:
  - You have, huh?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.

- que:
  - Where are we going?
  ans:
  - Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.

- que:
  - You're a big girl, huh?
  ans:
  - I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I've got something for you.

- que:
  - You got this under control?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
  ans:
  - Help me get her off the rug.

- que:
  - Where is he? Did you lose him?
  ans:
  - Shut up.

- que:
  - What about them?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for them.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.

- que:
  - And what happens if I don't call you?
  ans:
  - I kill her anyway.

- que:
  - What gives?
  ans:
  - Just put her on.

- que:
  - Any trouble?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you figure he done with it?
  ans:
  - He took the secret with him when I dropped him.

- que:
  - How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
  ans:
  - I come not with Peace but with a Sword.

- que:
  - You, Preacher?
  ans:
  - That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.

- que:
  - What religion do you profess, Preacher?
  ans:
  - The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.

  ans:

  ans:
  - Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

  ans:
  - Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.

- que:

  ans:

  - Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
  ans:
  - She went.

- que:

  ans:
  - She went.

  ans:
  - Yes, I reckon that's it.

  ans:
  - Yes; from the first night.

- que:
  - The first night?
  ans:
  - Our honeymoon.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - She turned me out of the bed.

- que:
  - What do you figure to do?
  ans:
  - Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.

- que:
  - Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
  ans:
  - A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.

- que:
  - Yes.
  ans:
  - Do you want more children, Willa?

- que:
  - Are you through praying?
  ans:
  - I'm through, Harry.

  ans:
  - Mornin', ladies.

- que:
  - Where's your Missus?
  ans:
  - She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.

- que:
  - Where's she at?
  ans:
  - Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.

- que:
  - How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
  ans:
  - This man down at the Drugstore...

- que:
  - The Drugstore?
  ans:
  - Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.

- que:
  - What you been up to?
  ans:
  - I been out with men.

- que:
  - Now who was this?
  ans:
  - He never asked me for nothin'.

- que:
  - What'd you all talk about?
  ans:
  - No, nothing.

- que:
  - Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
  ans:
  - Please, Nancy. Trust us.

- que:
  - How long's this been going on?
  ans:
  - Since the murder. She was fine before that.

- que:
  - What the hell are dreams, anyway?
  ans:
  - What happened? That needle sank like a rock.

- que:
  - Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
  ans:
  - How can you tell?

- que:
  - Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
  ans:
  - Because he was scary, that's why.

- que:
  - Yeah. Something slippery all over here... Tina?
  ans:
  - Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.

- que:
  - Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
  ans:
  - Guess I did.

- que:
  - Haven't slept, have you?
  ans:
  - Not really.

- que:
  - M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last night?
  ans:
  - Slept like a rock.

- que:
  - Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You believe in the Boogey Man?
  ans:
  - One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.

- que:
  - You believe in anything?
  ans:
  - I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.

- que:
  - Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay, okay. I think.

- que:
  - Used to. Not anymore.
  ans:
  - Yeah. So?

- que:
  - You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
  ans:
  - They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.

- que:
  - What happens if they don't do that?
  ans:
  - I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.

- que:
  - Hello?
  ans:
  - Hi.

- que:
  - Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
  ans:
  - Much better.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - The killer.

- que:
  - You do?
  ans:
  - Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.

- que:
  - Bring him out of what?
  ans:
  - My dream.

- que:
  - How you plan to do that?
  ans:
  - Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.

- que:
  - You crazy? Hit him with what?
  ans:
  - You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...

- que:
  - Meanwhile...?
  ans:
  - Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.

- que:
  - How you doing, pal?
  ans:
  - Okay. Hi, dad.

- que:
  - You got a sane explanation for what he did?
  ans:
  - She dreamed this would happen...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.

- que:
  - Dad -- what you doing here?
  ans:
  - Hello Nancy.

- que:
  - You know he's dead though, right?
  ans:
  - Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.

- que:
  - -- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
  ans:
  - Sure, but...

- que:
  - Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
  ans:
  - She lived there.

- que:
  - Who? Who did that?
  ans:
  - Krueger.

- que:
  - Krueger?
  ans:
  - Had to've done it. No one else was in there.

- que:
  - How you know that?
  ans:
  - Maybe god's punishing us all...

- que:
  - Like Rod Lane?
  ans:
  - School.

- que:
  - I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
  ans:
  - Right home after. See you.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.

- que:
  - I must be going nuts...
  ans:
  - You okay?

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.

- que:
  - What's with the bars?
  ans:
  - S'curity.

- que:
  - So he's alive?
  ans:
  - Go on...

- que:
  - All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
  ans:
  - Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.

- que:
  - Feeling better?
  ans:
  - They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before. No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.

- que:
  - He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change?
  ans:
  - The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.

- que:
  - And then what happened?
  ans:
  - I told you. It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.

- que:
  - How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
  ans:
  - How the fuck do I know? I don't expect you to believe me.

- que:
  - Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
  ans:
  - Because somebody cut her. While I watched.

- que:
  - What you mean 'all at once'?
  ans:
  - I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...

- que:
  - Do you think I did it?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all. So what you dream?
  ans:
  - Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.

- que:
  - You feel better now, right?
  ans:
  - Jungle man fix Jane.

- que:
  - No more fights?
  ans:
  - No more fights.

- que:
  - When did you have a nightmare?
  ans:
  - Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.

- que:
  - Have you any money?
  ans:
  - Well, here are fifty francs.

- que:
  - RUSSIANS What is it, Ninotchka?
  ans:
  - It's from Paris.

- que:
  - RUSSIANS From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
  ans:
  - Good evening, Anna.

- que:
  - Aren't you late?
  ans:
  - No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.

- que:
  - What are you serving?
  ans:
  - An omelet.

- que:
  - An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
  ans:
  - Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.

- que:
  - About what?
  ans:
  - Ever since you have been back from Paris...

- que:
  - Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
  ans:
  - No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.

- que:
  - Tell me... what else did you have?
  ans:
  - Well, a hat...

- que:
  - What was it like?
  ans:
  - It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.

- que:
  - Evening gown?
  ans:
  - A dress you wear in the evening.

- que:
  - What do you wear in the morning?
  ans:
  - When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.

- que:
  - You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - And there?
  ans:
  - Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.

- que:
  - What is it, Anna?
  ans:
  - You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...

- que:
  - You want this?
  ans:
  - Just for the honeymoon.

- que:
  - Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
  ans:
  - Possibly.

- que:
  - If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
  ans:
  - I can tell you exactly.

- que:
  - Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
  ans:
  - Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.

- que:
  - Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
  ans:
  - You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.

- que:
  - How many families live here with you?
  ans:
  - She's right... anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.

- que:
  - Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
  ans:
  - No, no.

- que:
  - May I ask how much your rooms are?
  ans:
  - Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.

- que:
  - How are things in Moscow?
  ans:
  - Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.

- que:
  - You didn't get legal advice?
  ans:
  - Comrade Buljanoff...

- que:
  - Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
  ans:
  - With two f's, if you please.

- que:
  - Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
  ans:
  - Yes, Comrade.

- que:
  - Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
  ans:
  - We have opened a restaurant...

- que:
  - Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
  ans:
  - You think because you represent the former Duchess...

- que:
  - Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
  ans:
  - About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.

- que:
  - Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
  ans:
  - Oh, yes, yes.

- que:
  - A blue shirt, perhaps?
  ans:
  - Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.

- que:
  - What time have you, Gaston?
  ans:
  - Eight forty-two, sir.

- que:
  - Have you?
  ans:
  - Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.

- que:
  - Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Yes, General Savitzky?
  ans:
  - Are they indeed? Thank you.

- que:
  - You're looking magnificent, Leon... ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
  ans:
  - Thank you, Louis.

- que:
  - Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
  ans:
  - Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.

- que:
  - Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
  ans:
  - You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.

- que:
  - What is it, my boy?
  ans:
  - Leon, my little boy.

- que:
  - How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
  ans:
  - We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...

- que:
  - Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
  ans:
  - Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?

- que:
  - I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
  ans:
  - Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.

- que:
  - What proposition?
  ans:
  - I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.

- que:
  - What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
  ans:
  - Razinin.

- que:
  - What did she say about me?
  ans:
  - I think she covered you with the parasites.

- que:
  - You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
  ans:
  - No, no.

- que:
  - How much does this cost?
  ans:
  - Two thousand francs.

- que:
  - A week?
  ans:
  - A day.

- que:
  - Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows. Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
  ans:
  - Just looking around.

- que:
  - Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...

- que:
  - Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
  ans:
  - He is a porter. He wants to carry them.

- que:
  - Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
  ans:
  - Allow me, Comrade.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.

- que:
  - I hope so for your sake. Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
  ans:
  - We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.

- que:
  - How are you, you three scoundrels?
  ans:
  - Well, we're back home.

- que:
  - I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
  ans:
  - Yes. It is unfortunate.

- que:
  - Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
  ans:
  - We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.

- que:
  - What can I do about it?
  ans:
  - She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.

- que:
  - You want me to go in there?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

- que:
  - What business?
  ans:
  - On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.

- que:
  - You believe in our cause?
  ans:
  - She must have her little joke. You're not going to take that seriously.

- que:
  - That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
  ans:
  - The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?

- que:
  - What for... why?
  ans:
  - Or a tunnel or a bridge...

- que:
  - Yes. Could you give me some information?
  ans:
  - Gladly.

- que:
  - How long do we have to wait here?
  ans:
  - Well -- until the policeman whistles again.

- que:
  - How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
  ans:
  - That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.

- que:
  - Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
  ans:
  - In other words you don't know.

- que:
  - Can I help you?
  ans:
  - You might hold this for me.

- que:
  - Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
  ans:
  - No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.

- que:
  - How long does it take a man to land?
  ans:
  - Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it! Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.

- que:
  - Why do you need my finger?
  ans:
  - Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.

- que:
  - I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
  ans:
  - I don't have to but I find it natural.

- que:
  - For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
  ans:
  - Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.

- que:
  - You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
  ans:
  - Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.

- que:
  - And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes, it is.

- que:
  - I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
  ans:
  - It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.

- que:
  - So that is your house?
  ans:
  - Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...

- que:
  - Does that mean that you want me to go there?
  ans:
  - Please don't misunderstand me...

- que:
  - Is this what you call the \"butler\"?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - He looks sad. Do you whip him?
  ans:
  - No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.

- que:
  - Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
  ans:
  - Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.

- que:
  - Is that customary?
  ans:
  - I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.

- que:
  - And what is your profession?
  ans:
  - Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.

- que:
  - And what do you do for mankind?
  ans:
  - For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.

- que:
  - Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
  ans:
  - Your general appearance is not distasteful.

- que:
  - Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
  ans:
  - I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.

- que:
  - What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
  ans:
  - You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.

- que:
  - The bayonet? Did you really?
  ans:
  - I was wounded before Warsaw.

- que:
  - I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
  ans:
  - I'd love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

- que:
  - What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
  ans:
  - Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.

- que:
  - Do you hear that?
  ans:
  - It's twelve o'clock.

- que:
  - Was that talkative?
  ans:
  - No, that was restful. Again.

- que:
  - Then how did you get here?
  ans:
  - I always eat here.

- que:
  - Must one always be after something?
  ans:
  - Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because we are an odd couple.

- que:
  - On which boat?
  ans:
  - Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.

- que:
  - Do you like Scotch stories?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You remember this room?
  ans:
  - Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.

- que:
  - Did you make any change in this room?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - She is very attractive. She has great elegance. She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
  ans:
  - Ninotchka, I love you.

- que:
  - How do you do?
  ans:
  - And General Savitzky.

- que:
  - A funny story?
  ans:
  - You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.

- que:
  - No speech?
  ans:
  - No speech.

- que:
  - Are we going to build our little house?
  ans:
  - Yes... a little white house.

- que:
  - Would that make you any happier?
  ans:
  - Much happier.

- que:
  - Radio! What is radio?
  ans:
  - Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.

- que:
  - Who cried that one?
  ans:
  - It is their wish.

- que:
  - Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
  ans:
  - Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.

- que:
  - Did you win?
  ans:
  - Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.

- que:
  - Those newspaper people?
  ans:
  - Now, Swana...

- que:
  - First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

- que:
  - Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
  ans:
  - Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?

- que:
  - Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - You haven't seen her yet?
  ans:
  - That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.

- que:
  - Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
  ans:
  - You can't imagine.

- que:
  - Thank you.
  ans:
  - You saw all that in one glimpse?

- que:
  - Is this your new dress suit?
  ans:
  - Yes, Swana.

- que:
  - Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
  ans:
  - Yes, Swana, you did.

- que:
  - It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
  ans:
  - Yes, Swana.

- que:
  - I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
  ans:
  - No... please...

- que:
  - There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
  ans:
  - Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.

- que:
  - Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
  ans:
  - No thanks, Swana.

- que:
  - Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
  ans:
  - I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.

- que:
  - Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
  ans:
  - Brutal frankness, if you insist.

- que:
  - What is this, Swana?
  ans:
  - Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.

- que:
  - Has done what?
  ans:
  - She's gone, Leon.

- que:
  - Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
  ans:
  - Do you expect me to believe that?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.

- que:
  - Please come to the point. What is it you want?
  ans:
  - I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.

- que:
  - Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
  ans:
  - My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - You leave me no choice.

- que:
  - Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
  ans:
  - Unfortunately.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Well... that's my business, madame.

- que:
  - Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
  ans:
  - Yes, it does.

- que:
  - You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
  ans:
  - Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.

- que:
  - May I ask why?
  ans:
  - Please... sit down.

- que:
  - Cigarette?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
  ans:
  - It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.

- que:
  - You want me to go to Constantinople?
  ans:
  - Yes... leaving immediately.

- que:
  - This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps? Or a nice little corner table?
  ans:
  - This will do.

- que:
  - I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
  ans:
  - Raw carrots and beets.

- que:
  - But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
  ans:
  - The future of the common people.

- que:
  - Can you recommend a restaurant?
  ans:
  - Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...

- que:
  - Where do you eat?
  ans:
  - At Pre Mathieu's.

- que:
  - Where is that?
  ans:
  - It's just a place for workmen.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.

- que:
  - What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
  ans:
  - No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.

- que:
  - But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning. We don't have the staff to ...
  ans:
  - Why do you bring this up after so many years?

- que:
  - Where the hell is he?
  ans:
  - Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...

- que:
  - How's the job coming, Bob?
  ans:
  - Frankly, sir, it stinks. I have no access. I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.

- que:
  - Then what about this Washington Post crap? Woodwind and Fernstein?
  ans:
  - Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Hunt has nothing to lose now. Pardon all of them. Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.

- que:
  - How much do you need?
  ans:
  - Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...

- que:
  - I agree it's ridiculous but --
  ans:
  - I agree it's ridiculous but --

- que:
  - That's not the question, John. The question is, Why is he paying?
  ans:
  - To protect his people.

- que:
  - Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
  ans:
  - You do it.

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - Cause he hates you. It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.

- que:
  - How so?
  ans:
  - The \"Old Man\" plays politics harder than anybody else.

- que:
  - You think this is just about politics?
  ans:
  - It's a code or something.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.

- que:
  - Jesus! Did Mitchell know?
  ans:
  - Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.

- que:
  - Mitchell?
  ans:
  - No! Magruder! That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.

- que:
  - Hunt? Howard Hunt?
  ans:
  - He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.

- que:
  - Well, he's photogenic. Let's try dog bones?
  ans:
  - I like it. I like the idea.

- que:
  - Is it legal? I mean has anyone ever done it before?
  ans:
  - Sure. Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.

- que:
  - Where's Hunt now?
  ans:
  - In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me.

- que:
  - And?
  ans:
  - He wants money.

- que:
  - I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
  ans:
  - Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay? In ... hundreds? Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - Is the war worth it? Is it worth a one-term presidency? Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.

- que:
  - Yeah, good old Spiro. Well, better him than me. What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
  ans:
  - He's begging for a meeting, chief. He wants to go overseas for awhile.

- que:
  - What about England?
  ans:
  - Forget it. Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...

- que:
  - This is June twentieth?
  ans:
  - It's marked. Also there's June twenty third. And this year -- March twenty first. Those are the ones ...

- que:
  - May I say something, Mr. President?
  ans:
  - There's no secrets here, Al.

- que:
  - Exactly! We've got to take the war to them. Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts. More assassinations, more killings. Right, Al?
  ans:
  - Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Cox! Fire him.

- que:
  - Sir, the deadline is today.
  ans:
  - So?

- que:
  - Can we get around this, Al?
  ans:
  - It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.

- que:
  - The army?
  ans:
  - Lincoln used it.

- que:
  - How do you see this?
  ans:
  - We can't survive this, sir. They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.

- que:
  - They did what?! I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
  ans:
  - Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.

- que:
  - Contributions! It was a legal contribution. Who the hell authorized this? Colson?
  ans:
  - We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...

- que:
  - What's Liddy got?
  ans:
  - Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico. The FBI's onto it. We could have a problem with that.

- que:
  - On the list of horribles, I know what he is. And I know what he tracks back to. You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
  ans:
  - Definitely. Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.

- que:
  - I had nothing to do with that. Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
  ans:
  - Yes, you approved it, sir.

- que:
  - I did?
  ans:
  - It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke. They went in to get his psychiatric records.

- que:
  - Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
  ans:
  - Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.

- que:
  - We'll work on it. I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
  ans:
  - What do you mean, sir?

- que:
  - Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys? Or maybe Chotiner?
  ans:
  - You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you. But ...

- que:
  - That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman. He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
  ans:
  - Just do what I say, Bob.

- que:
  - Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
  ans:
  - Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.

- que:
  - How is this national security?
  ans:
  - Because the President says it is. My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I'll talk to Helms. Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.

- que:
  - Yes, sir. I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing? What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
  ans:
  - He wouldn't do the makeup. Said it was for queers.

- que:
  - Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
  ans:
  - The bastard! If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won. He made me look soft.

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you.

- que:
  - I don't understand. Track 2's Chile?
  ans:
  - The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.

- que:
  - Before?! Eisenhower approved that?
  ans:
  - He didn't veto it. I ran the White House side. The mob contact was Johnny Roselli. One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.

- que:
  - Alright. But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
  ans:
  - ... he'd just found out about Track 2.

- que:
  - You never told him?
  ans:
  - I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.

- que:
  - If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
  ans:
  - Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good. We have to get out in front of this thing. The PR is going to murder us.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - These kids are being manipulated by the Communists. Like Chambers and Hiss.

- que:
  - No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious. Why're we stopping?
  ans:
  - Run 'em over.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - ... \"The Beast.\" A nineteen-year-old kid. She understands the nature of \"the Beast.\" She called it a wild animal.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...

- que:
  - My God, my God! He talked to the New York Times?
  ans:
  - Because they're not Americans.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - When I met with him, he said ...

- que:
  - What about the documents he promised?
  ans:
  - No ...

- que:
  - Why me?
  ans:
  - Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him. Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.

- que:
  - I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
  ans:
  - Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Is it my turn?
  ans:
  - I can't ...

- que:
  - What about happiness, Mother?
  ans:
  - Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard. Strength in this life. Happiness in the next.

- que:
  - What'd he say?
  ans:
  - What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.

- que:
  - What'd you say?
  ans:
  - I said I didn't need a free ride. I need a suit.

- que:
  - What ... ?
  ans:
  - Go to law school. Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...

- que:
  - Harold ... can I get you anything?
  ans:
  - Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it? I want to go home, Dick. Time to go home.

- que:
  - You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
  ans:
  - I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President. You did.

- que:
  - Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
  ans:
  - You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Mr. Castro.

- que:
  - Are you tapping Kissinger?
  ans:
  - My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.

- que:
  - Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
  ans:
  - This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President. Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.

- que:
  - By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
  ans:
  - Cuba would be a small price to pay.

- que:
  - You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats? \"The Second Coming\"?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
  ans:
  - He's lying, Clyde. Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still. And take your hand off your hip.

- que:
  - It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
  ans:
  - ... little Bobby.

- que:
  - Winning?
  ans:
  - Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.

- que:
  - How about you? Are you going to win?
  ans:
  - You should ask Bobby.

- que:
  - Roselli? Johnny Roselli?
  ans:
  - Yes. Your old friend from Cuba.

- que:
  - Yeah, you do. I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
  ans:
  - It won't. As long as I'm here.

- que:
  - Injections. Even this noble sport's been fixed. Seen the guys?
  ans:
  - They're around.

- que:
  - Why, you got a customer?
  ans:
  - The White House.

- que:
  - Where'd you find him?
  ans:
  - Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.

- que:
  - So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
  ans:
  - I won't tell him if you won't.

- que:
  - Howard ... What the hell? What're you doing?
  ans:
  - Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow. It keeps me calm. I don't like going back into the same building four times.

- que:
  - Mein Kampf?
  ans:
  - \"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk.\" Nietzsche.

- que:
  - Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
  ans:
  - Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.

- que:
  - So, what's this about, Dick?
  ans:
  - The American people put me where I am.

- que:
  - Well, goddamn. Are you threatening me, Dick?
  ans:
  - He was, he was. We taught a class together at Harvard. But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...

- que:
  - I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry. What do you think?
  ans:
  - Exactly, sir. That is your historical contribution, to lead boldly in an era of limits.

- que:
  - All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing. You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
  ans:
  - I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.

- que:
  - Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
  ans:
  - Oh God, I'm going to throw up.

- que:
  - Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?
  ans:
  - Yes. My mother used to pray ... a lot. It's been a long time since I really prayed. Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.

- que:
  - Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it?
  ans:
  - Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.

- que:
  - Secret, Mr. Chairman?
  ans:
  - How a fat man gets so many girls.

- que:
  - I was asleep, Mr. President. What can I get you?
  ans:
  - Just ... uh ... you know.

- que:
  - Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
  ans:
  - Yes, Mr. President.

- que:
  - You don't think he was a hero?
  ans:
  - He was a politician.

- que:
  - Did you cry when he died?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He made me see the stars ...

- que:
  - How did he do that? All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
  ans:
  - I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.

- que:
  - You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
  ans:
  - I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.

- que:
  - So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
  ans:
  - Free, if you're the president.

- que:
  - What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile? You gonna send Kissinger down there?
  ans:
  - We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.

- que:
  - How about Kissinger along with him?
  ans:
  - Kissinger's misunderstood. He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...

- que:
  - The lie?
  ans:
  - And Dick beat the shit out of them.

- que:
  - Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John?
  ans:
  - What the hell -- I love her. And she's great in bed.

- que:
  - How many?
  ans:
  - Four. Two boys. Two girls. And eight wounded.

- que:
  - You all right?
  ans:
  - My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John. Tuberculosis got him.

- que:
  - Where you from?
  ans:
  - Syracuse.

- que:
  - ... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like? I mean, what kind of clothes do you like? Do you like blue ... red?
  ans:
  - Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...

- que:
  - What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
  ans:
  - I like jazz ...

- que:
  - Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
  ans:
  - Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...

- que:
  - She must be very attractive. Would she like an autograph? She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
  ans:
  - We didn't come here to talk about football. We came here to end the war.

- que:
  - But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
  ans:
  - Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison. Gandhi, Lenin ...

- que:
  - What's in there?
  ans:
  - POWs. And their families.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Of them.

- que:
  - You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
  ans:
  - No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.

- que:
  - What are you saying? What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I want a divorce.

- que:
  - My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
  ans:
  - The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.

- que:
  - Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
  ans:
  - We can be happy. We really can. We love you, Dick. The girls and I...

- que:
  - If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
  ans:
  - I'll do it. No more.

- que:
  - Are you serious?
  ans:
  - Yeah ... I'm out.

- que:
  - Is that the truth?
  ans:
  - I'll never run again. I promise.

- que:
  - Were you planning to tell me?
  ans:
  - We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...

- que:
  - Do you really want this, Dick?
  ans:
  - This. Above all.

- que:
  - You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
  ans:
  - And then you'll be happy?

- que:
  - Can I just ask for one thing?
  ans:
  - Anything.

- que:
  - Hi, Buddy. What are you doing in here?
  ans:
  - I've missed you.

- que:
  - Are you okay?
  ans:
  - Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together? Just the two of us.

- que:
  - You personally?
  ans:
  - Sometimes I think that's what you want.

- que:
  - How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
  ans:
  - Not for the Pentagon it isn't. I'm kissing Mao's ass. And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Tomorrow.

- que:
  - Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling. But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - And what am I doing?
  ans:
  - I wish I knew. You're hiding.

- que:
  - Hiding what?
  ans:
  - I'm the only left, Dick. If you don't talk to me, you ...

- que:
  - Why didn't you?
  ans:
  - You can't expect me to explain that to you.

- que:
  - Repartee, Dick -- very good. Hey, I feel ten years younger! It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
  ans:
  - Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it. I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.

- que:
  - Won or lost?
  ans:
  - Lost.

- que:
  - To what?
  ans:
  - Write. You know, a book. I'm calling it \"Six Crises.\" It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.

- que:
  - The \"crises\"?
  ans:
  - \"Checkers\" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.

- que:
  - Whatcha mean by that?
  ans:
  - Some say you are, Rocky.

- que:
  - You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
  ans:
  - What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.

- que:
  - But -- how'd you know it was mine?
  ans:
  - I deduced it. Once you walked in.

- que:
  - How many a those things you got now?
  ans:
  - Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.

- que:
  - How you been, Ellis?
  ans:
  - You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.

- que:
  - Want a cup?
  ans:
  - Predate it.

- que:
  - How fresh is this coffee?
  ans:
  - I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.

- que:
  - What would you a done if he'd been released?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.

- que:
  - How come're you doin that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I feel overmatched.

- que:
  - When did he die?
  ans:
  - Nineteen zero and nine.

- que:
  - No ID in her room?
  ans:
  - Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...

- que:
  - No money in his room there?
  ans:
  - Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.

- que:
  - Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
  ans:
  - Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.

- que:
  - You ain't heard from him?
  ans:
  - No I ain't.

- que:
  - Nothin'?
  ans:
  - Not word one.

- que:
  - Would you tell me if you had?
  ans:
  - Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.

- que:
  - Who's he in trouble with then?
  ans:
  - Some pretty bad people.

- que:
  - Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
  ans:
  - I don't know. My mind wanders.

- que:
  - If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
  ans:
  - Yes ma'am, I do.

- que:
  - Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
  ans:
  - It could be.

- que:
  - The old boy shot by the highway?
  ans:
  - That's very linear Sheriff.

- que:
  - You sure?
  ans:
  - Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.

- que:
  - Llewelyn Moss?
  ans:
  - That's the boy.

- que:
  - You figure him for a dope runner?
  ans:
  - Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.

- que:
  - What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
  ans:
  - Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

- que:
  - ...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
  ans:
  - I don't know...

- que:
  - We goin' in?
  ans:
  - Gun out and up.

- que:
  - What about yours?
  ans:
  - I'm hidin' behind you.

- que:
  - That from the lock?
  ans:
  - Probably must be.

- que:
  - So when was he here?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Oh.

- que:
  - Sheriff?
  ans:
  - Sheriff, that's aggravating.

- que:
  - You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
  ans:
  - I don't know. He ought to...

- que:
  - What was the bullet?
  ans:
  - Wasn't no bullet.

- que:
  - Wasn't no bullet?
  ans:
  - Yessir. Wasn't none.

- que:
  - Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
  ans:
  - Sir, I don't want to picture that.

- que:
  - I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
  ans:
  - No sir.

- que:
  - Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
  ans:
  - Yessir. It was punched out.

- que:
  - You gonna drive out there?
  ans:
  - No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.

- que:
  - How's that, Sheriff?
  ans:
  - Natural to the line of work they was in.

- que:
  - That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
  ans:
  - I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.

- que:
  - You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
  ans:
  - Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.

- que:
  - ...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
  ans:
  - We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.

- que:
  - ...How'd you sleep?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Had dreams.

- que:
  - Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
  ans:
  - Well they always is to the party concerned.

- que:
  - You gave your word?
  ans:
  - To your husband.

- que:
  - That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
  ans:
  - Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.

- que:
  - What's in the satchel?
  ans:
  - It's full a money.

- que:
  - ...Where'd you get the pistol?
  ans:
  - At the gettin' place.

- que:
  - Did you buy that gun?
  ans:
  - No. I found it.

- que:
  - What'd you give for that thing?
  ans:
  - You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.

- que:
  - What're you doin', baby?
  ans:
  - Goin' out.

- que:
  - Goin' where?
  ans:
  - Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.

- que:
  - What're you goin' to do?
  ans:
  - ...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

- que:
  - Why would we go to Odessa?
  ans:
  - Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

- que:
  - Well -- how come?
  ans:
  - So... for how long do we have to...

- que:
  - What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
  ans:
  - Try standin' in the door and hollerin, Mama I'm home.

- que:
  - Why all the way to Del Rio?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.

- que:
  - You can't afford one?
  ans:
  - Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.

- que:
  - Promise?
  ans:
  - Yes I do.

- que:
  - You are comin back, ain't ya?
  ans:
  - I shall return.

- que:
  - Llewelyn?
  ans:
  - Hey.

- que:
  - What makes you say that?
  ans:
  - I can hear it in your voice.

- que:
  - Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
  ans:
  - She'll be all right.

- que:
  - She'll be all right?
  ans:
  - We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.

- que:
  - Why would I let you do that?
  ans:
  - I know where the money is.

- que:
  - You mean the nature of this conversation?
  ans:
  - I mean the nature of you.

- que:
  - Yessir?
  ans:
  - I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

- que:
  - Did you go up to his trailer?
  ans:
  - Yes I did.

- que:
  - Where does he work?
  ans:
  - I can't say.

- que:
  - Where does he work?
  ans:
  - Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.

- que:
  - Where does he work?
  ans:
  - Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.

- que:
  - Is Llewelyn there?
  ans:
  - Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

- que:
  - What's this about?
  ans:
  - Step out of the car please, sir.

- que:
  - ...Where's the transponder?
  ans:
  - In the truck. I'll get it.

- que:
  - ...You getting anything on this?
  ans:
  - Not a bleep.

- que:
  - How'd you find it?
  ans:
  - No me mate.

- que:
  - You from around here?
  ans:
  - What airport would you use.

- que:
  - Huh? Airport or airstrip?
  ans:
  - Airport.

- que:
  - Well -- where ya goin'?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
  ans:
  - Why would I care where you're going.

- que:
  - Do you know where I'm going?
  ans:
  - ...I know where you are.

- que:
  - You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I know where you're going.

- que:
  - CHAIR ...Me?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - How much?
  ans:
  - Sixty-nine cent.

- que:
  - What way would that be?
  ans:
  - I seen you was from Dallas.

- que:
  - What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
  ans:
  - I didn't mean nothin' by it.

- que:
  - Will there be anything else?
  ans:
  - You already asked me that.

- que:
  - What time do you close?
  ans:
  - Now. We close now.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - I said you don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Yes I do.

- que:
  - You've lived here all your life?
  ans:
  - This was my wife's father's place. Originally.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.

- que:
  - Call it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - Just call it.

- que:
  - Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - You stand to win everything. Call it.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.

- que:
  - ...Where you want me to put it?
  ans:
  - Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.

- que:
  - You already have the tent?
  ans:
  - Somethin' like that.

- que:
  - What kind of tent?
  ans:
  - The kind with the most poles.

- que:
  - Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
  ans:
  - One room, one night.

- que:
  - You on all night?
  ans:
  - Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.

- que:
  - You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
  ans:
  - No sir, it's unusual.

- que:
  - What room?
  ans:
  - Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.

- que:
  - You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
  ans:
  - No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.

- que:
  - I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
  ans:
  - He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.

- que:
  - You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
  ans:
  - ...I'm wondering...

- que:
  - Can I get my parking ticket validated?
  ans:
  - ...An attempt at humor, I suppose.

- que:
  - The what?
  ans:
  - The option.

- que:
  - You want to change rooms?
  ans:
  - No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.

- que:
  - Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
  ans:
  - What about one forty-two.

- que:
  - Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
  ans:
  - Half.

- que:
  - What else then?
  ans:
  - Lookin' for what's comin'.

- que:
  - What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
  ans:
  - I don't think that's how I would describe him.

- que:
  - How would you describe him?
  ans:
  - I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor. His name is Chigurh.

- que:
  - Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
  ans:
  - I know how he found me.

- que:
  - ...What do you do?
  ans:
  - I'm retired.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I'm a welder.

- que:
  - Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
  ans:
  - Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.

- que:
  - Cast iron?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Were you in Nam?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I was in Nam.

- que:
  - So what does that make me? Your buddy?
  ans:
  - Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.

- que:
  - Why would he go to Odessa?
  ans:
  - To kill your wife.

- que:
  - ...You didn't take the product, did you?
  ans:
  - What product.

- que:
  - If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
  ans:
  - He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.

- que:
  - Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
  ans:
  - I don't know. American citizens.

- que:
  - Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
  ans:
  - You do, I reckon.

- que:
  - That is correct. And how do I decide?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Are you jackin' with me?
  ans:
  - No sir.

- que:
  - Are you in the service?
  ans:
  - No sir. I'm a veteran.

- que:
  - Nam?
  ans:
  - Yes sir. Two tours.

- que:
  - How is she?
  ans:
  - She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.

- que:
  - Could I have that in American?
  ans:
  - It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.

- que:
  - No... Friends from the diner maybe?
  ans:
  - Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...

- que:
  - Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.

- que:
  - Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
  ans:
  - They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.

- que:
  - Did you send anyone out there?
  ans:
  - You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - You said a woman couldn't have done it.

- que:
  - What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
  ans:
  - We think we know where Betty is.

- que:
  - Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
  ans:
  - I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...

- que:
  - Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
  ans:
  - Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.

- que:
  - Well, do something, then, damnit!
  ans:
  - She said she was in Arizona, did she?

- que:
  - Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
  ans:
  - No, I didn't have to.

- que:
  - Little place called \"Williams,\" why?
  ans:
  - I know plenty.

- que:
  - No, I was just... How you doing?
  ans:
  - Great. Good. Content...

- que:
  - They're fine... you miss it?
  ans:
  - You must be joking.

- que:
  - Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...

- que:
  - Who are these idiots?
  ans:
  - This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...

- que:
  - Do you know who I am?
  ans:
  - ...I... I know what you are.

- que:
  - You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
  ans:
  - I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.

- que:
  - So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
  ans:
  - Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.

- que:
  - ...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
  ans:
  - ...to see you.

- que:
  - I am?
  ans:
  - Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.

- que:
  - ...what're you saying?
  ans:
  - When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.

- que:
  - Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
  ans:
  - Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.

- que:
  - So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
  ans:
  - I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...

- que:
  - Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
  ans:
  - I don't think I am.

- que:
  - You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone. Is that issue?
  ans:
  - Umm... yes. Back home.

- que:
  - Did you watch it yet?
  ans:
  - Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...

- que:
  - No... what about your sister?
  ans:
  - I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.

- que:
  - Maroon. I stole it.
  ans:
  - Aahhh... So what color is it?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.

- que:
  - Are you and Larry happy?
  ans:
  - Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.

- que:
  - All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
  ans:
  - All the time...

- que:
  - Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
  ans:
  - Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.

- que:
  - Do what?
  ans:
  - I gotta go.

- que:
  - ...of course you do. You don't remember me?
  ans:
  - I take it I should. I'm sorry.

- que:
  - I beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - That's very kind of you.

- que:
  - I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
  ans:
  - I guess we all did. You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...

- que:
  - Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
  ans:
  - You're late, Eric.

- que:
  - She's a good person to know. So where did you study again?
  ans:
  - Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...

- que:
  - What happened when you were twelve?
  ans:
  - Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...

- que:
  - I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
  ans:
  - Of course.

- que:
  - She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men... So where are we going?
  ans:
  - Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.

- que:
  - Didn't I?
  ans:
  - No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot. Was this before Leslie? Before us?...

- que:
  - I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes... maybe it was.

- que:
  - Ad lib?
  ans:
  - In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.

- que:
  - David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
  ans:
  - Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.

- que:
  - Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
  ans:
  - What do you mean? What did I do to you...

- que:
  - Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
  ans:
  - Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?

- que:
  - You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
  ans:
  - No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I... ...I'm sorry.

- que:
  - Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
  ans:
  - Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...

- que:
  - No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
  ans:
  - I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...

- que:
  - Or the vitamins? Or the...?
  ans:
  - I got you, Del...

- que:
  - Oh, I know. So, who're these clients?
  ans:
  - Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.

- que:
  - Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
  ans:
  - I came for love...

- que:
  - You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
  ans:
  - It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.

- que:
  - That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
  ans:
  - Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...

- que:
  - What're you doing here, Roy?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You did? Was it anyone that you...?
  ans:
  - It was Chloe...

- que:
  - He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
  ans:
  - What's the matter here?

- que:
  - So you're into \"Reason,\" too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
  ans:
  - Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...

- que:
  - Where you headed, Betty?
  ans:
  - Los Angeles, California.

- que:
  - Did you love it?
  ans:
  - Sure I loved it! It was great.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...

- que:
  - Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
  ans:
  - No. Loma Vista.

- que:
  - What's his real name?
  ans:
  - Dr. David Ravell.

- que:
  - You mean... George McCord, the actor?
  ans:
  - No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.

- que:
  - Piss off, Merle. So how you gonna find him, Betty?
  ans:
  - I'll go to the Hospital.

- que:
  - Like Rome?
  ans:
  - Worse.

- que:
  - Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
  ans:
  - I married a car salesman.

- que:
  - I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
  ans:
  - ...did I win some contest?

- que:
  - So why'd you come to L.A.?
  ans:
  - I came for love. My fianc is here.

- que:
  - David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
  ans:
  - No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.

- que:
  - The one you were telling me about?
  ans:
  - It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.

- que:
  - The Five?
  ans:
  - Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.

- que:
  - Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
  ans:
  - Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?

- que:
  - Guess who I saw today.
  ans:
  - How many men have I talked to?

- que:
  - Who?
  ans:
  - Doctor David Ravell.

- que:
  - This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
  ans:
  - If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?

- que:
  - So what do you say? Can we be friends?
  ans:
  - ...okay.

- que:
  - What are those for?
  ans:
  - Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...

- que:
  - Looking for someone?
  ans:
  - You never know who you'll see.

- que:
  - Were you with him this whole time?
  ans:
  - Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...

- que:
  - Does he know you think he's real?
  ans:
  - He is real.

- que:
  - Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
  ans:
  - Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...

- que:
  - No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
  ans:
  - To a party in the Hollywood Hills.

- que:
  - Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
  ans:
  - Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.

- que:
  - This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
  ans:
  - No, almost never.

- que:
  - Are you sure I can borrow this?
  ans:
  - No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...

- que:
  - Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
  ans:
  - You should have a little faith in people.

- que:
  - Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
  ans:
  - All the time. It's always \"Loma Vista\" this, \"Loma Vista\" that.

- que:
  - Oh, he does that. It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
  ans:
  - Rosa, so you've met David?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.

- que:
  - Where are you going?
  ans:
  - I have to leave now.

- que:
  - What?! That you had something to do with it?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...

- que:
  - Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
  ans:
  - I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.

- que:
  - What can I do for you, gentlemen?
  ans:
  - How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...

- que:
  - Good.
  ans:
  - More than you know. Is there anything else?

- que:
  - What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
  ans:
  - Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.

- que:
  - The fuck you talking about?
  ans:
  - Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.

- que:
  - Really. And where was that, old man?
  ans:
  - Andersonville. They did horrible things to men there...

- que:
  - I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy... Who's birthday?
  ans:
  - Ahh... my wife's.

- que:
  - If we're for real?
  ans:
  - You don't exactly look like drug dealers.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.

- que:
  - Of what?
  ans:
  - I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.

- que:
  - You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - Hmmmm. \"Five Stars,\" huh? Is that stupid, Wesley?
  ans:
  - You did not just say \"Injuns,\" Del.

- que:
  - I... I don't know...
  ans:
  - Like what?

- que:
  - My socks?
  ans:
  - Relax, we brought the cash.

- que:
  - I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
  ans:
  - No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.

- que:
  - So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
  ans:
  - Hell of a way to die.

- que:
  - That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you?
  ans:
  - This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.

- que:
  - Well, why'd you shoot him?
  ans:
  - That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...

- que:
  - What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
  ans:
  - It's not here. Let's go.

- que:
  - You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
  ans:
  - Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.

- que:
  - What the hell was that, another statement?
  ans:
  - Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.

- que:
  - We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size... He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
  ans:
  - I hope you're right...

- que:
  - I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.

- que:
  - A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
  ans:
  - Betty, Betty, Betty...

- que:
  - Like... us?
  ans:
  - No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.

- que:
  - Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch. What time're they coming?
  ans:
  - It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.

- que:
  - Half.
  ans:
  - And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - They paid us half. They still owe us half...

- que:
  - What the hell's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - That was a really shitty thing to do.

- que:
  - How'd they describe her?
  ans:
  - You know, blonde, thin, whatever...

- que:
  - Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
  ans:
  - We should go.

- que:
  - No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
  ans:
  - I said, 'No.' N-O.

- que:
  - Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
  ans:
  - Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.

- que:
  - Where? Where is she?
  ans:
  - I'm not telling.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.

- que:
  - So you believed the bartender. Why?
  ans:
  - Well... I think I saw her soul.

- que:
  - What doesn't?
  ans:
  - You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...

- que:
  - Don't Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
  ans:
  - Man, you have got to get some therapy.

- que:
  - What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
  ans:
  - Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.

- que:
  - Not her mouth... I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
  ans:
  - ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?

- que:
  - What's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - This is Betty at twelve.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.

- que:
  - ...and how long did she work here?
  ans:
  - Oh, five years, give or take.

- que:
  - Hmm... you two in high school together?
  ans:
  - Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.

- que:
  - I see. May I?
  ans:
  - If it helps bring her back, be my guest...

- que:
  - What'd you get her?
  ans:
  - Huh? Oh, umm, a car. So, to a successful transaction...

- que:
  - Isn't that the point?
  ans:
  - Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Funny, that's just what I was thinking...

- que:
  - No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
  ans:
  - Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.

- que:
  - I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
  ans:
  - I'll think about it.

- que:
  - \"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?\" Remember?
  ans:
  - ...yeah.

- que:
  - What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
  ans:
  - What the hell's going on?

- que:
  - That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
  ans:
  - Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.

- que:
  - ...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
  ans:
  - Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.

- que:
  - Yeah? The sport utility?
  ans:
  - Uh-huh.

- que:
  - Damn, that's sweet... She really that good-looking in person?
  ans:
  - Better.

- que:
  - Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Would you say she was ambitious?
  ans:
  - You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...

- que:
  - ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
  ans:
  - Because it ain't natural, young man.

- que:
  - Yeah. Why, you know him?
  ans:
  - Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...

- que:
  - What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
  ans:
  - Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.

- que:
  - So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
  ans:
  - So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.

- que:
  - Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
  ans:
  - David Ravell.

- que:
  - God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
  ans:
  - Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.

- que:
  - Did Chloe crack?
  ans:
  - Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...

- que:
  - Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
  ans:
  - She's a lesbian.

- que:
  - I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
  ans:
  - No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.

- que:
  - I see. Did Chloe testify?
  ans:
  - I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...

- que:
  - Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
  ans:
  - Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.

- que:
  - Once again we find ourselves in agreement. What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?

  - I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
  ans:
  - What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?

- que:
  - ...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
  ans:
  - Good Lord, what do we do?

  ans:
  - Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.

- que:
  - So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
  ans:
  - I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.

- que:
  - What sat mean exactly, Everett?
  ans:
  - Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.

- que:
  - Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
  ans:
  - We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

- que:
  - What's his name again?
  ans:

  ans:
  - Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

- que:
  - - in the gods - Huh?
  ans:
  - That's not my ring.

- que:
  - How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
  ans:
  - Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.

- que:
  - Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
  ans:
  - Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.

- que:
  - Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
  ans:
  - Now what can I do you for, Mister French?

- que:
  - ...Yeah?
  ans:
  - Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.

- que:
  - You, Zack?
  ans:
  - Yes, Sir.

- que:
  - How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Okay, okay. You win.

- que:
  - So what're you doing in Seattle?
  ans:
  - Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.

- que:
  - You... in the Navy?
  ans:
  - That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.

- que:
  - Who gave you this idea?
  ans:
  - Nobody. It just came to me.

- que:
  - Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.

- que:
  - Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
  ans:
  - From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.

- que:
  - Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
  ans:
  - Naw. That's over with.

- que:
  - Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
  ans:
  - Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night. Survival of the fittest.

- que:
  - The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
  ans:
  - You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies, Seeger.

- que:
  - Esther, do you think she's using... ...birth control?
  ans:
  - Yes, Joe.

- que:
  - When did this happen?
  ans:
  - A long time ago.

- que:
  - He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
  ans:
  - I don't mean anything by it.

- que:
  - How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
  ans:
  - Not exactly, sir.

- que:
  - That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
  ans:
  - I don't want to do something anybody can do.

- que:
  - You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
  ans:
  - But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.

- que:
  - Hi, son.
  ans:
  - I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?

- que:
  - What did you call me, boy?
  ans:
  - I called you Sarge.

- que:
  - You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Where are you from, boy?
  ans:
  - Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

- que:
  - What are you tired from?
  ans:
  - Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.

- que:
  - You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
  ans:
  - Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.

- que:
  - Is your brother a flyer?
  ans:
  - He was. He died.

- que:
  - Vietnam?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
  ans:
  - We don't have to talk at all.

- que:
  - You're sure it's okay?
  ans:
  - Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.

- que:
  - Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
  ans:
  - Or we could do that yeah.

- que:
  - Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
  ans:
  - If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.

- que:
  - By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
  ans:
  - I'm a little late, that's all.

- que:
  - How late?
  ans:
  - What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.

- que:
  - What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
  ans:
  - No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.

- que:
  - What other issue is there, Sid?
  ans:
  - My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.

- que:
  - ...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side. So how late are you, Lynette?
  ans:
  - Let's just wait and see what happens.

- que:
  - I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
  ans:
  - No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.

- que:
  - You what?
  ans:
  - I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.

- que:
  - But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
  ans:
  - Sid, there's no baby.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.

- que:
  - That was you guys, huh?
  ans:
  - Come on. Let's go dance.

- que:
  - Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
  ans:
  - Great.

- que:
  - What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
  ans:
  - Everything was different.

- que:
  - He ask you out for next weekend?
  ans:
  - No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.

- que:
  - You serious about having him over?
  ans:
  - I haven't made up my mind.

- que:
  - God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
  ans:
  - That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.

- que:
  - And you turned him down?
  ans:
  - Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.

- que:
  - Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
  ans:
  - Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.

- que:
  - Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
  ans:
  - Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.

- que:
  - You got a girl?
  ans:
  - No, and I'm not looking for one either.

- que:
  - Yeah? Why're you here?
  ans:
  - To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.

- que:
  - Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
  ans:
  - Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.

- que:
  - Where'd you learn to fight like that?
  ans:
  - I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.

- que:
  - What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
  ans:
  - To have a good time with you until you have to go.

- que:
  - That's it?
  ans:
  - Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.

- que:
  - Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
  ans:
  - I've never had a girl.

- que:
  - Want me to get a towel?
  ans:
  - I'll get it if you want.

- que:
  - What's stopping you?
  ans:
  - That's no excuse for not going after what you want.

- que:
  - Does it still hurt?
  ans:
  - Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.

- que:
  - Hey, will you just leave me alone?
  ans:
  - Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...

- que:
  - Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
  ans:
  - When I'm good and ready.

- que:
  - Are those for me?
  ans:
  - No, they're for your mom.

- que:
  - So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
  ans:
  - Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.

- que:
  - No. Is that what you want?
  ans:
  - Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.

- que:
  - What would you do differently?
  ans:
  - For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.

- que:
  - Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
  ans:
  - Because my real father wouldn't marry her.

- que:
  - Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
  ans:
  - Twenty-two years ago.

- que:
  - So?
  ans:
  - Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.

- que:
  - I'd like to come with you.
  ans:
  - Why'd he do it?

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - Because he's my friend, too.

- que:
  - He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
  ans:
  - Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.

- que:
  - Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
  ans:
  - I don't notice anyone else complaining.

- que:
  - Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
  ans:
  - Yeah. All week long.

- que:
  - He said he grew up poor?
  ans:
  - The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.

- que:
  - Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
  ans:
  - Jets.

- que:
  - Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
  ans:
  - You told us it would grow out an inch.

- que:
  - You okay?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Hey, you guys still awake?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
  ans:
  - Naw.

- que:
  - That isn't true, is it?
  ans:
  - A little.

- que:
  - I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
  ans:
  - You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.

- que:
  - I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
  ans:
  - She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.

- que:
  - Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
  ans:
  - No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.

- que:
  - But she expects you to marry her?
  ans:
  - She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.

- que:
  - I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
  ans:
  - Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.

- que:
  - Do you know that for sure?
  ans:
  - It's mine.

- que:
  - Sid, what happened?
  ans:
  - I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.

- que:
  - What if she called the cops?
  ans:
  - She didn't.

- que:
  - What the fuck is funny about this?
  ans:
  - God.

- que:
  - What? What do you want me to do?
  ans:
  - What do you think? Get us into that room.

- que:
  - You got an idea?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Yeah, I got an idea. I gotta check something.

- que:
  - The hell does she want?
  ans:
  - I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.

- que:
  - Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you. You can wait a half hour, can't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah. She can. She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid. Half an hour.

- que:
  - -- posed to mean?
  ans:
  - You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one. Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.

- que:
  - The walls are steel, right?
  ans:
  - Fourteen business days. Escrow is always business days.

- que:
  - I mean, right? Isn't it?
  ans:
  - You're an idiot.

- que:
  - Who is this guy?
  ans:
  - Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.

- que:
  - Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them. We're okay, here. We can do this, right?
  ans:
  - Forty-five minutes. That's all you said you need. That's like nothing.

- que:
  - Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
  ans:
  - Asshole.

- que:
  - Where did you get this clown?
  ans:
  - I met him at the tables, same as you. And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.

- que:
  - The fuck did you bring a gun for?
  ans:
  - It's still a good plan. It's just... got a twist.

- que:
  - Okay, fuckball, you think. What are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - She said she did.

- que:
  - Yes. Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing. You fuck. Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
  ans:
  - Can't. Whole point. Can't get in the room.

- que:
  - Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
  ans:
  - Cell phone.

- que:
  - Jesus, what was I thinking?
  ans:
  - Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.

- que:
  - What about us?
  ans:
  - We're not leaving. I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - Bout four o'clock.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - We'd like to come in.

- que:
  - Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
  ans:
  - You don't look so good.

- que:
  - Master closet.
  ans:
  - May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?

- que:
  - Will they take asking price? I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
  ans:
  - Could the child please stop that?

- que:
  - A what?
  ans:
  - A safe room. An inner sanctum. A castle keep, in medieval times.

- que:
  - It's okay, Raoul.
  ans:
  - Push that button for me, will you?

- que:
  - It's just the woman and the kid?
  ans:
  - Cut it back a little bit.

- que:
  - How many more do we have after this?
  ans:
  - None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.

- que:
  - I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
  ans:
  - Makes me nervous.

- que:
  - Ever read any Poe?
  ans:
  - I don't think so, but I love her album.

- que:
  - Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
  ans:
  - Open the door.

- que:
  - Got us in here, didn't I?
  ans:
  - Shoulda got an apartment.

- que:
  - What do they want?
  ans:
  - I don't know. Rob us. I don't know.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - Wait.

- que:
  - What if they get in here?
  ans:
  - They can't. They can't get in here. No. They can't.

- que:
  - Feel okay?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Shaky?
  ans:
  - Nope.

- que:
  - Chills?
  ans:
  - No, I told you, they can't. It's not a possibility.

- que:
  - Are you freaking out?
  ans:
  - Little bit. Yeah.

- que:
  - Small space?
  ans:
  - Don't though.

- que:
  - I don't know, why?
  ans:
  - Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.

- que:
  - Do it.
  ans:
  - Where'd you learn S.O.S.?

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - I saw something, I saw...

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - I was trying not to tell you...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I'm dizzy and thirsty.

- que:
  - Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign. Did you see any sugar in here? Any candy bars, anything sweet?
  ans:
  - Huh uh.

- que:
  - What if I keep dropping?
  ans:
  - Not an option.

- que:
  - What if I spazz out?
  ans:
  - No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.

- que:
  - Where is the Glucogen?
  ans:
  - Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.

- que:
  - Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
  ans:
  - Those ain't cops.

- que:
  - And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
  ans:
  - Alma I told you to...

- que:
  - Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
  ans:
  - I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.

- que:
  - What are you doing with the gun?
  ans:
  - What are doing with yours?.

- que:
  - Well... is it loaded?
  ans:
  - I tell you \"officer\", it wasn't...

- que:
  - You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
  ans:
  - You know it brother.

- que:
  - No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...

- que:
  - Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
  ans:
  - No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...

- que:
  - Like?
  ans:
  - Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.

- que:
  - Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
  ans:
  - Just hold on a god damn minute. I...

- que:
  - So... we understand each other Judge?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
  ans:
  - Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.

- que:
  - What's with you?
  ans:
  - Get out of the fucking car.

- que:
  - Yeah, it's me.
  ans:
  - What are you crazy?

- que:
  - Judge, calm down.
  ans:
  - Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?

- que:
  - Hey... what the hell you doing?
  ans:
  - I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.

- que:
  - Who? I mean besides the FBI?
  ans:
  - You know that's bullshit.

- que:
  - Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
  ans:
  - Hey, this what they got you doing now?

- que:
  - Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
  ans:
  - PE? What? You guys doing gym class?

- que:
  - You got it. Berkeley?
  ans:
  - No, Panther Headquarters. Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.

- que:
  - Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
  ans:
  - Cy... I ain't even sure.

- que:
  - Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
  ans:
  - N... N...... Not... Oh.

- que:
  - Can you make a deal with them?
  ans:
  - Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.

- que:
  - You want me to put a man on it?
  ans:
  - That would be an excellent start. Tell him to keep a low profile.

- que:
  - Are you finished?
  ans:
  - Jesus...

- que:
  - And did you witness the shoot-out?
  ans:
  - Yes sir, I did.

- que:
  - From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
  ans:
  - No sir he didn't.

- que:
  - Huh, well then... did someone else start shooting?
  ans:
  - I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.

- que:
  - Did you shoot the officers in question?
  ans:
  - Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.

- que:
  - Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
  ans:
  - Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.

- que:
  - Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
  ans:
  - C'mon let's...

- que:
  - That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
  ans:
  - Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it. Men? Well we can spare six for security...

- que:
  - You were. infantry right?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - So what's the deal?
  ans:
  - Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.

- que:
  - You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah... let me think about it.

- que:
  - Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
  ans:
  - I'm down.

- que:
  - Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
  ans:
  - Whatever you need, I'll be there.

- que:
  - Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
  ans:
  - You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...

- que:
  - What's the pig's name?
  ans:
  - Brimmer.

- que:
  - Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
  ans:
  - Man, this shit's pretty thick.

- que:
  - Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
  ans:
  - Like the manual says, \"Information is...

- que:
  - But nothing... you do live here don't you?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I do.

- que:
  - And who is we?
  ans:
  - Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.

- que:
  - Busted firing pin. You want only the legal stuff right?
  ans:
  - Just the legit shit.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - He had a feeling you'd be coming by.

- que:
  - What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
  ans:
  - If you got something to say, say it.

- que:
  - What are you saying?
  ans:
  - The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.

- que:
  - Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
  ans:
  - Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.

- que:
  - You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
  ans:
  - All of the above, man... And then some.

- que:
  - Rose, what the hell you doing here?
  ans:
  - Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...

- que:
  - This cool the heat off you any?
  ans:
  - I don't know. But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.

- que:
  - Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
  ans:
  - Not at all. I'll catch you later.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It was Sabu killed Cy.

- que:
  - Rose?
  ans:
  - Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.

- que:
  - I saw. I saw that big one hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too. They take you to jail?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
  ans:
  - Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.

- que:
  - You believe that?
  ans:
  - I don't know. I really don't.

- que:
  - Do you think Frances with an \"e\" is too manly a name for a girl?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Do you think Francis with an \"i\" is too womanly a name for a boy?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Late summer.

- que:
  - You call that a compliment?
  ans:
  - It's a start.

- que:
  - You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
  ans:
  - I expect to try.

- que:
  - It worked. How many men can you raise?
  ans:
  - I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.

- que:
  - Am I one of that sort?
  ans:
  - You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.

- que:
  - Well?
  ans:
  - I've just been inside the mind of a genius. Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.

- que:
  - What do you mean, old and ugly?
  ans:
  - You got me beat on both accounts.

- que:
  - You don't know him very well, do you?
  ans:
  - He's my father.

- que:
  - I know him well enough?
  ans:
  - Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier. It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.

- que:
  - How did this... how did I let this happen?
  ans:
  - You couldn't have known.

- que:
  - Excuse me?
  ans:
  - I said, I'm not my sister.

- que:
  - Do you?
  ans:
  - Of course, I do.

- que:
  - What unit?
  ans:
  - First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.

- que:
  - Who cared for your wounds?
  ans:
  - We did.

- que:
  - With a lace table cloth?
  ans:
  - My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed. Thank you for that, Colonel.

- que:
  - Shall we proceed?
  ans:
  - I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.

- que:
  - Oh?
  ans:
  - I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.

- que:
  - Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
  ans:
  - Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.

- que:
  - Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
  ans:
  - That is a separate issue.

- que:
  - Sir?
  ans:
  - You have eighteen of my men. I want them back.

- que:
  - Their names, ranks and posts?
  ans:
  - My harrier. Join us, Colonel.

- que:
  - Are you going to meet with him?
  ans:
  - Most certainly. Arrange it.

- que:
  - How can we end this madness?
  ans:
  - Difficult, sir. This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.

- que:
  - Do you see that, Colonel?
  ans:
  - Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.

- que:
  - Thank you. How's the spotted one's milk?
  ans:
  - The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...

- que:
  - Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
  ans:
  - Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.

- que:
  - What news?
  ans:
  - The British army is barricaded in Boston. Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.

- que:
  - Is that why the Assembly was convened?
  ans:
  - Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money.

- que:
  - And the Governor?
  ans:
  - He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.

- que:
  - Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Not yet. What happened?
  ans:
  - I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.

- que:
  - What now, sir?
  ans:
  - We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the Santee...

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir. My father taught me.

- que:
  - Did your father teach you humility?
  ans:
  - He tried. It didn't take.

- que:
  - Is it?
  ans:
  - If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.

- que:
  - How old are you?
  ans:
  - You know how old I am.

- que:
  - Flanking riders?
  ans:
  - I didn't see any.

- que:
  - Father?
  ans:
  - Pride is his weakness.

- que:
  - Gabriel? Are you asleep?
  ans:
  - We're low on salt. I should go to Pembroke and get some.

- que:
  - When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
  ans:
  - No...

- que:
  - She spoke? Susan spoke?
  ans:
  - Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.

- que:
  - She said that? Oh, my Lord, she said that?
  ans:
  - Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there.

- que:
  - Granted. Where are you going?
  ans:
  - Cheraw Falls.

- que:
  - Where?
  ans:
  - Seven homes along the Black River so far...

- que:
  - Is it her? Is Anne in there?
  ans:
  - She is. Don't go in there.

- que:
  - Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
  ans:
  - You know what happened.

- que:
  - And what do they know?
  ans:
  - That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.

- que:
  - As you did at Fort Wilderness?
  ans:
  - He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.

- que:
  - An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission?
  ans:
  - Please.

- que:
  - Damn it, Francis! How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
  ans:
  - Harry, Harry, Harry...

- que:
  - And your principles?
  ans:
  - I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.

- que:
  - One of yours?
  ans:
  - Gabriel.

- que:
  - I recognize him now. Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
  ans:
  - No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother.

- que:
  - Where is he now?
  ans:
  - Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.

- que:
  - Who's in command?
  ans:
  - I am, I think.

- que:
  - What are my orders?
  ans:
  - So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Fall, six months at the earliest.

- que:
  - You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
  ans:
  - Not held, just slowed down.

- que:
  - How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
  ans:
  - Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry... ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.

- que:
  - How many men have we seen die?
  ans:
  - Two. Gabriel and Thomas.

- que:
  - Your son, what did you name him?
  ans:
  - Robert. Robert E. Lee.

- que:
  - How far away?
  ans:
  - Four, five miles.

- que:
  - But what about Thomas?
  ans:
  - Leave him. Take care of William and Susan.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For trying to impose some decency on that sort.

- que:
  - How many came back?
  ans:
  - About a hundred and twenty. Less than a third.

- que:
  - He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
  ans:
  - Yes, he does.

- que:
  - That bad?
  ans:
  - Worse.

- que:
  - And what is the second thing?
  ans:
  - Not yet, Thomas.

- que:
  - When?
  ans:
  - Seventeen.

- que:
  - Father?
  ans:
  - Six-pounders. Lots of them.

- que:
  - Who might you be, little Miss?
  ans:
  - I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.

- que:
  - But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
  ans:
  - You'll see soon enough, hon.

- que:
  - Bite?
  ans:
  - Ayuh.

- que:
  - They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
  ans:
  - What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?

- que:
  - Honey, Church will be fine.
  ans:
  - Is that right, dad?

- que:
  - Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
  ans:
  - He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.

- que:
  - Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
  ans:
  - For a little while.

- que:
  - In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
  ans:
  - Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.

- que:
  - Is he really all right?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Ellie? What's wrong?
  ans:
  - No more chocolate chip cookies.

- que:
  - Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
  ans:
  - At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.

- que:
  - Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
  ans:
  - I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?

- que:
  - Do you believe that?
  ans:
  - I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.

- que:
  - Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
  ans:
  - Yeah, sure.

- que:
  - I'm sure you're not.
  ans:
  - I'm not tired!

- que:
  - Then why do I have to go to bed?
  ans:
  - I swear.

- que:
  - You need a glass?
  ans:
  - Not at all.

- que:
  - What were you listening to?
  ans:
  - Allman Brothers.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.

- que:
  - You folks ready to go on?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
  ans:
  - Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.

- que:
  - Not yet...how much further is it?
  ans:
  - I think it is so, Ellie.

- que:
  - Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
  ans:
  - Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.

- que:
  - Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Going to tell Ellie?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
  ans:
  - Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.

- que:
  - Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
  ans:
  - We're still not where we're going.

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - The place we're going is on the other side of that.

- que:
  - Yes. Where are we going, Jud?
  ans:
  - You'll see before long. Let's go.

- que:
  - Is there quicksand?
  ans:
  - Ayuh.

- que:
  - Whose burying ground?
  ans:
  - The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.

- que:
  - I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
  ans:
  - I guess so...but...

- que:
  - You want to rest a bit before you start?
  ans:
  - No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.

- que:
  - What are those for?
  ans:
  - Your cairn.

- que:
  - Jud, why am I doing all this?
  ans:
  - Because it's right.

- que:
  - I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
  ans:
  - What did we do, Jud?

- que:
  - Wouldn't wash?
  ans:
  - Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.

- que:
  - Can I have another one?
  ans:
  - I guess it wouldn't hurt.

- que:
  - Wendigo?
  ans:
  - You and this old Indian rag-man--

- que:
  - Rachel not feeling well?
  ans:
  - It's Ellie's cat.

- que:
  - Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
  ans:
  - No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.

- que:
  - I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
  ans:
  - I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.

- que:
  - It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
  ans:
  - You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?

- que:
  - Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
  ans:
  - Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.

- que:
  - Louis, are you sure?
  ans:
  - Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.

- que:
  - What's in your head, boy?
  ans:
  - And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.

- que:
  - The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
  ans:
  - You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.

- que:
  - That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - I'm supposed to ... trust you?
  ans:
  - You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.

- que:
  - You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
  ans:
  - Blast you! I'll throw you in prison.

- que:
  - What -- you don't have the medallion?
  ans:
  - That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.

- que:
  - So how did you get off that island, anyway?
  ans:
  - You can go to your grave not knowing.

- que:
  - Why don't I want to do this?
  ans:
  - Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.

- que:
  - What're you suggesting?
  ans:
  - Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.

- que:
  - There's ... another exit?
  ans:
  - Aye, for us there is.

- que:
  - So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
  ans:
  - Or you could surrender.

- que:
  - Now?
  ans:
  - Now. No, don't kill him.

- que:
  - Do you believe him?
  ans:
  - No. But him I believe. He us genuinely angry.

- que:
  - My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
  ans:
  - Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.

- que:
  - You have a name, missy?
  ans:
  - Elizabeth -- Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household.

- que:
  - And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
  ans:
  - Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.

- que:
  - Maid or not, it fits you.
  ans:
  - Can I trust you?

- que:
  - Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
  ans:
  - Now, none of that. Please dig in.

- que:
  - Then why aren't you eating?
  ans:
  - Would that I could.

- que:
  - Do you not know what this is, then?
  ans:
  - It's a pirate medallion.

- que:
  - The curse drove you to gather this?
  ans:
  - He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.

- que:
  - I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
  ans:
  - Not as a condition -- a request.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I know where your heart truly lies.

- que:
  - Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
  ans:
  - Yes -- yes.

- que:
  - Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
  ans:
  - Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.

- que:
  - Ceremony?
  ans:
  - Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

- que:
  - Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
  ans:
  - At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.

- que:
  - Why would my father send this to me?
  ans:
  - To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.

- que:
  - Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
  ans:
  - You are despicable.

- que:
  - Has it changed since the last time you were here?
  ans:
  - The trees are taller.

- que:
  - What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
  ans:
  - It won't. It won't, and so we won't.

- que:
  - So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
  ans:
  - Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

- que:
  - You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - Aye, that'll about do it.
  ans:
  - What's your plan?

- que:
  - First -- have you found me a crew?
  ans:
  - Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.

- que:
  - Say again?
  ans:
  - I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.

- que:
  - Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
  ans:
  - That he is.

- que:
  - How did you get off the island?
  ans:
  - Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.

- que:
  - Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew. He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
  ans:
  - Really? So ... what's the story on the pistol?

- que:
  - How did he get off the island?
  ans:
  - It's a signal. If we resist, it won't just be death. There'll be torture as well.

- que:
  - Hands! Come about! Jackets off the cannons! We are to fire on our own ship?
  ans:
  - Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.

- que:
  - Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?
  ans:
  - I don't think that will be necessary.

- que:
  - Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?
  ans:
  - No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.

- que:
  - What's your name?
  ans:
  - Smith.

- que:
  - Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.

- que:
  - Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
  ans:
  - By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.

- que:
  - They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
  ans:
  - Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.

- que:
  - You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
  ans:
  - I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.

- que:
  - Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
  ans:
  - You threatened Miss Swann.

- que:
  - Who makes all these?
  ans:
  - I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.

- que:
  - You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
  ans:
  - You cheated.

- que:
  - Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
  ans:
  - Somewhat.

- que:
  - Why ask me?
  ans:
  - Because you're a pirate.

- que:
  - And you want to turn pirate yourself?
  ans:
  - I'd die for her.

- que:
  - We're going to steal a ship? That ship?
  ans:
  - Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.

- que:
  - My father. William Turner?
  ans:
  - I knew him. Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

- que:
  - Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
  ans:
  - But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate--

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - Depends.

- que:
  - Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
  ans:
  - On what?

- que:
  - Are you certain this is the right way?
  ans:
  - It's the right way.

- que:
  - You've seen it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You've seen the Black Pearl?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
  ans:
  - ... No.

- que:
  - What happened here?
  ans:
  - An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

- que:
  - Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
  ans:
  - Until he's done.

- que:
  - Mr. Sim, when you do locate him. Do not scare him off again. Just watch him. I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
  ans:
  - You got it, Dr. Argon.

- que:
  - Have you found Dr. Bright?
  ans:
  - No. The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.

- que:
  - Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
  ans:
  - No, thank you.

- que:
  - Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
  ans:
  - I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.

- que:
  - How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
  ans:
  - I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.

- que:
  - What are you going to do to him?
  ans:
  - Do? Well, I suppose that depends on you.

- que:
  - What did you use?
  ans:
  - A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal. He'll sleep, that's all.

- que:
  - In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab. I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
  ans:
  - Icky! What's happening?

- que:
  - Oh no. No. We'll get her assistant. What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
  ans:
  - Nebbleman.

- que:
  - Do you think she will give us the designs?
  ans:
  - Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.

- que:
  - And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
  ans:
  - That remains to be seen.

- que:
  - And you still believe he's going to come here?
  ans:
  - Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.

- que:
  - Do you think she loves him?
  ans:
  - She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.

- que:
  - Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
  ans:
  - No, Icky, this is real.

- que:
  - Icarus, please! This is important!
  ans:
  - Yes. Yes, of course it is.

- que:
  - Then you still love me?
  ans:
  - Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.

- que:
  - Icarus?
  ans:
  - I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.

- que:
  - Consideration?
  ans:
  - If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.

- que:
  - Can you feel it, Poppy? The presence of the moment? Can you feel the weight of its significance?
  ans:
  - Oh yes, Icky. I can feel it.

- que:
  - Did you feel that?
  ans:
  - Well, yes. The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.

- que:
  - Where did he go?
  ans:
  - The trunk.

- que:
  - Excellent. How long until the assembler tank is complete?
  ans:
  - Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.

- que:
  - Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
  ans:
  - You better quit pushing me, pal.

- que:
  - Aaabout...?
  ans:
  - This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.

- que:
  - A man?
  ans:
  - Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.

- que:
  - What did he want?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure. That's the funny thing about him. He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.

- que:
  - Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
  ans:
  - They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.

- que:
  - What did security say?
  ans:
  - They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.

- que:
  - The replicators?
  ans:
  - Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you. She's waiting in the lab.

- que:
  - What are you going to do?
  ans:
  - What I've always done. As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.

- que:
  - There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that?
  ans:
  - Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.

- que:
  - Is that what Argon told you?
  ans:
  - No! Well, not those exact words.

- que:
  - Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
  ans:
  - Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.

- que:
  - You mean the designs for the nanobot? You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
  ans:
  - I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.

- que:
  - Yes?
  ans:
  - I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.

- que:
  - What's it smell like?
  ans:
  - Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.

- que:
  - He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
  ans:
  - Like Crazy Glue?

- que:
  - Daniel...
  ans:
  - And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?

- que:
  - When did you...?
  ans:
  - Been out for six months now.

- que:
  - Really? What have you been doing?
  ans:
  - You know, this and that.

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off. Oh no. The big house does things to a man.

- que:
  - The big house?
  ans:
  - The big house.

- que:
  - Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
  ans:
  - It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.

- que:
  - Sure. Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while. How come?
  ans:
  - Nothing really worthwhile.

- que:
  - We'll see? What does that mean?
  ans:
  - We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.

- que:
  - Mouse? What mouse?
  ans:
  - My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.

- que:
  - What happened to it?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - You don't know?
  ans:
  - It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.

- que:
  - We don't?
  ans:
  - What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.

- que:
  - What are these?
  ans:
  - Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract. We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.

- que:
  - Why do we need it?
  ans:
  - The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.

- que:
  - That was 'simple'?
  ans:
  - Got it.

- que:
  - That was an egg?
  ans:
  - Three days ago it was.

- que:
  - What do these replicators do to people?
  ans:
  - With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.

- que:
  - So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
  ans:
  - That's right.

- que:
  - Isn't it already too late then?
  ans:
  - I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.

- que:
  - The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate. So what's wrong?
  ans:
  - Just giving credit where credit is due.

- que:
  - Do you have something to bring me down?
  ans:
  - No problem.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - The nanobot... it's not here...

- que:
  - How far can you stretch?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - What did you want my hair for?
  ans:
  - Something else I want to try.

- que:
  - What's that?
  ans:
  - It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.

- que:
  - That's going to fit me?
  ans:
  - Like a glove.

- que:
  - You made this out of my hair?
  ans:
  - Sort of. We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.

- que:
  - Did you go?
  ans:
  - On the counter.

- que:
  - Who is he?
  ans:
  - The head shrinker at the prison.

- que:
  - You didn't think I could just leave you?
  ans:
  - I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.

- que:
  - Where is it?
  ans:
  - Argon's private lab.

- que:
  - Did you think I could just leave you...?
  ans:
  - Susie... I...

- que:
  - What in the...?
  ans:
  - Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.

- que:
  - You mean he's polymerized, like me?
  ans:
  - That means the nanobot is still inside him.

- que:
  - What would happen if I threw him into the core?
  ans:
  - I remember I was trying to help...

- que:
  - You were looking for us?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.

- que:
  - An ass-beating. Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
  ans:
  - All the different ways that I could kill you.

- que:
  - The question is, are you?
  ans:
  - That's impossible.

- que:
  - Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically.

- que:
  - And you have him?
  ans:
  - We lost him.

- que:
  - Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
  ans:
  - I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.

- que:
  - Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
  ans:
  - I could have you fired right now.

- que:
  - In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
  ans:
  - Yes, he might be.

- que:
  - What in the hell?
  ans:
  - Pipe down, brain lady! And you...

- que:
  - Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride. Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
  ans:
  - Yes - Sing Sing.

- que:
  - To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
  ans:
  - Exactly.

- que:
  - Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
  ans:
  - You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.

- que:
  - Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
  ans:
  - Dexter.

- que:
  - No? Why not?
  ans:
  - You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.

- que:
  - May I use your telephone?
  ans:
  - Certainly. Right over there.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - That's considerate of you.

- que:
  - Where did you get those letters?
  ans:
  - I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.

- que:
  - I suppose you're going to print them?
  ans:
  - No - give you another guess.

- que:
  - Will you step into the library?
  ans:
  - Sure, I'll take a chance.

- que:
  - For what?
  ans:
  - For the letters, of course.

- que:
  - Really?
  ans:
  - Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.

- que:
  - I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
  ans:
  - You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?

- que:
  - Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
  ans:
  - Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.

- que:
  - Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
  ans:
  - You wear them of course, silly.

- que:
  - Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
  ans:
  - Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.

- que:
  - Gallagher?
  ans:
  - Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.

- que:
  - No? What do you look upon her as?
  ans:
  - Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.

- que:
  - Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
  ans:
  - Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.

- que:
  - Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
  ans:
  - I poisoned him.

- que:
  - What are you talking about?
  ans:
  - I'm talking about - I'm not going out.

- que:
  - What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
  ans:
  - Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.

- que:
  - Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
  ans:
  - But I don't want to meet your gang.

- que:
  - Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
  ans:
  - Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?

- que:
  - Good morning. What does this mean?
  ans:
  - Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.

- que:
  - What's the idea, Anne?
  ans:
  - The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.

- que:
  - Your house?
  ans:
  - and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.

- que:
  - Yeah, hello. How are you?
  ans:
  - Fine. Have a seat.

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - Yale '21, I believe.

- que:
  - Huh?
  ans:
  - We were classmates.

- que:
  - I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
  ans:
  - Is that so?

- que:
  - So, you see how silly that rumor is?
  ans:
  - Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.

- que:
  - Oh, is that so?
  ans:
  - I'm afraid.

- que:
  - What do you want?
  ans:
  - Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.

- que:
  - Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
  ans:
  - Oh boy, I'd love it.

- que:
  - How's that?
  ans:
  - Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.

- que:
  - I bring a message from Garcia.
  ans:
  - Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?

- que:
  - Yeah?
  ans:
  - Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.

- que:
  - I'll bite. What's the catch?
  ans:
  - There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.

- que:
  - Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
  ans:
  - Yeah.

- que:
  - You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
  ans:
  - With me you can always do business.

- que:
  - Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
  ans:
  - It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.

- que:
  - Gloria Golden?
  ans:
  - Yeah, little Gloria.

- que:
  - The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
  ans:
  - Right - for the first time this year.

- que:
  - No? Well, where were you when that happened?
  ans:
  - No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.

- que:
  - What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
  ans:
  - Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.

- que:
  - Is that so?
  ans:
  - You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.

- que:
  - And live on your salary, I suppose?
  ans:
  - Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.

- que:
  - What play?
  ans:
  - My play.

- que:
  - The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
  ans:
  - Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.

- que:
  - Araby?
  ans:
  - I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.

- que:
  - You're my what?
  ans:
  - Your valet, sir.

- que:
  - Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
  ans:
  - Dawson, sir.

- que:
  - Drunk, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.

- que:
  - What are you doing fooling around in here?
  ans:
  - Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.

- que:
  - Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
  ans:
  - Quite so. Quite.

- que:
  - That's a lovely dress.
  ans:
  - Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?

- que:
  - Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
  ans:
  - Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.

- que:
  - Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
  ans:
  - I didn't run away.

- que:
  - Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
  ans:
  - Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.

- que:
  - Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
  ans:
  - It's the smoke.

- que:
  - Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
  ans:
  - Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.

- que:
  - Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
  ans:
  - Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?

- que:
  - How is her family going to feel about it?
  ans:
  - I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.

- que:
  - Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
  ans:
  - I dyed one and washed the other.

- que:
  - Staring at us?
  ans:
  - My mistake - she's glaring.

- que:
  - No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - Hello, Hank. How are you?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.

- que:
  - I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
  ans:
  - Okay.

- que:
  - How far have you gotten?
  ans:
  - Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.

- que:
  - Been where?
  ans:
  - To Old Madrid.

- que:
  - Then how do you expect to write about it?
  ans:
  - Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.

- que:
  - Did who?
  ans:
  - Conrad.

- que:
  - Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
  ans:
  - Right.

- que:
  - Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
  ans:
  - Here you are.

- que:
  - All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
  ans:
  - Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.

- que:
  - Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
  ans:
  - It'll be ready in a minute.

- que:
  - Who was that?
  ans:
  - Grayson - Anne's lawyer.

- que:
  - What did he want?
  ans:
  - Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.

- que:
  - What other girl?
  ans:
  - The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.

- que:
  - Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
  ans:
  - No.

- que:
  - Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. What's Michael tearing the paper about?
  ans:
  - Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.

- que:
  - Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
  ans:
  - No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.

- que:
  - Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.

- que:
  - Now don't be absurd, Smith May I come in?
  ans:
  - Surely, come right in.

- que:
  - Thanks. May I sit down?
  ans:
  - Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.

- que:
  - She did?
  ans:
  - She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.

- que:
  - Sure.
  ans:
  - Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?

- que:
  - I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
  ans:
  - Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels will upset me.

- que:
  - Are the cars ready?
  ans:
  - They've been ready for the last half hour.

- que:
  - Get out of here.
  ans:
  - Why

- que:
  - And you struck him right here in our house?
  ans:
  - Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.

- que:
  - I understand, sir.
  ans:
  - Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?

- que:
  - Now, now Jeeves. Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
  ans:
  - The name is Smythe.

- que:
  - Shhh! Do you hear something?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Me, sir?
  ans:
  - Yes, sir.

- que:
  - Found no skeletons?
  ans:
  - No, sir.

- que:
  - Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
  ans:
  - Well, sir, I putter.

- que:
  - Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
  ans:
  - I just putter.

- que:
  - Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
  ans:
  - Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.

- que:
  - Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
  ans:
  - Well sir, I'll show you.

- que:
  - No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
  ans:
  - Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.

- que:
  - Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
  ans:
  - Yes sir.

- que:
  - How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
  ans:
  - You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.

- que:
  - A bird in a gilded cage?
  ans:
  - I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
  ans:
  - Yeah ... That--and ...

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - It doesn't matter.

- que:
  - You sure you want to know this?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Well ... ... Your father would never do anything like that.

- que:
  - We're in Pleasantville?
  ans:
  - Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.

- que:
  - Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
  ans:
  - No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.

- que:
  - How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
  ans:
  - I'm fine.

- que:
  - Have you got any make up?
  ans:
  - In my handbag.

- que:
  - Does it look okay?
  ans:
  - Looks just like it did.

- que:
  - And they won't be able to tell?
  ans:
  - No ... They won't be able to tell.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Thank you.

- que:
  - Where'd you get this?
  ans:
  - Bud brought it to me.

- que:
  - Bud?
  ans:
  - Here's my favorite.

- que:
  - Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
  ans:
  - She's crying.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - She's crying.

- que:
  - What is that?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - How was your day?
  ans:
  - Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.

- que:
  - All night?
  ans:
  - I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.

- que:
  - Where are you gonna go?
  ans:
  - I'm gonna go now.

- que:
  - What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
  ans:
  - Um ... It's ...

- que:
  - Really Biff? The keenest?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah.

- que:
  - Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
  ans:
  - Hunh? Oh, right ...

- que:
  - Oh you bet. Will you excuse me for a sec?
  ans:
  - Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...

- que:
  - But where would we go?
  ans:
  - ... Lover's Lane.

- que:
  - ... Why?
  ans:
  - I think ... I might be ill ...

- que:
  - It is?
  ans:
  - Trust me ...

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - It's six-thirty ...

- que:
  - Why not?
  ans:
  - I'm busy.

- que:
  - With what?
  ans:
  - Don't! Just let go.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I don't believe it.

- que:
  - What's the matter?
  ans:
  - You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...

- que:
  - Yeah ... How'd you know?
  ans:
  - Lucky guess. Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...

- que:
  - She won't go out with me?
  ans:
  - I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...

- que:
  - What'll it be?
  ans:
  - Oh, no thanks ...

- que:
  - No. What?
  ans:
  - Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.

- que:
  - Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
  ans:
  - I really don't know. Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.

- que:
  - ... How?
  ans:
  - No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...

- que:
  - Are you alright? What is it?
  ans:
  - Rain.

- que:
  - Did you do this?
  ans:
  - Yes I did.

- que:
  - Do you know that it's illegal?
  ans:
  - Yes I do.

- que:
  - BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
  ans:
  - Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.

- que:
  - Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
  ans:
  - We prefer to keep these proceedings as \"pleasant\" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.

- que:
  - Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
  ans:
  - Well--it was dark out ...

- que:
  - The basketball team?
  ans:
  - Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.

- que:
  - What do you mean!?
  ans:
  - Well, I never had to do it before.

- que:
  - And where's that?
  ans:
  - Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

- que:
  - What's outside of Pleasantville?
  ans:
  - Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.

- que:
  - I thought the books were blank?
  ans:
  - Hello Bud.

- que:
  - What color is that hedge of yours?
  ans:
  - Green.

- que:
  - What are you doing?
  ans:
  - David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.

- que:
  - Pleasantville Marathon?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Every episode ever.

- que:
  - What happened?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - What did you do?
  ans:
  - I don't know.

- que:
  - I don't know ... It's not possible ... Is it possible?
  ans:
  - I don't believe this.

- que:
  - You know him?
  ans:
  - Owns the hardware store.

- que:
  - Play along?
  ans:
  - Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.

- que:
  - Who's that?
  ans:
  - Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.

- que:
  - Does he--you know--like \"me\"?
  ans:
  - As a matter of fact he does.

- que:
  - Can we do any better?
  ans:
  - I don't think so.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.

- que:
  - He won't notice anyway.
  ans:
  - What were you doing in a library?

- que:
  - What do you mean?
  ans:
  - They don't notice that kind of thing.

- que:
  - So what's the point?
  ans:
  - Jen please ...

- que:
  - What did you do to him?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - Well if I don't who will?
  ans:
  - They're happy like this.

- que:
  - David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. You like all this don't you?
  ans:
  - I just don't think we have the right to ...

- que:
  - Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
  ans:
  - Me too. Sounds swell.

- que:
  - The pages filled in?
  ans:
  - But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.

- que:
  - What's wrong?
  ans:
  - Nothing.

- que:
  - You're reading?
  ans:
  - Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.

- que:
  - D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
  ans:
  - ... Yeah.

- que:
  - Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Sure.

- que:
  - Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
  ans:
  - Yeah ...

- que:
  - You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
  ans:
  - Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.

- que:
  - Can I ask you a question?
  ans:
  - Yes.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... ... it's not just the sex ...

- que:
  - Are you sure?
  ans:
  - I told you. I'm like positive.

- que:
  - Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
  ans:
  - Honestly ... no.

- que:
  - And you're sure about this?
  ans:
  - I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.

- que:
  - ... Lover's Lane?
  ans:
  - Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

- que:
  - Do they have those ... Where you come from?
  ans:
  - Yeah ... I guess. I don't know.

- que:
  - What?
  ans:
  - Out there.

- que:
  - How?
  ans:
  - Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...

- que:
  - What's that like?
  ans:
  - Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue.

- que:
  - Hunh?
  ans:
  - I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. Mmm. So sweet.

- que:
  - They just grow like that?
  ans:
  - Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.

- que:
  - What's going on?
  ans:
  - Rain.

- que:
  - What do we do?
  ans:
  - We'll just put up the top.

- que:
  - It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
  ans:
  - It was a prop for the school play ...

- que:
  - Can I open it?
  ans:
  - Sure ...

- que:
  - Where are they?
  ans:
  - I'm not sure.

- que:
  - Scout?
  ans:
  - Marmalade.

- que:
  - You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
  ans:
  - Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.

- que:
  - A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
  ans:
  - Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.

- que:
  - DYKE Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
  ans:
  - ... Her father.

- que:
  - DYKE Right. And how did she dress him?
  ans:
  - ... Like Prince Charming.

- que:
  - DYKE What department store did they go to?
  ans:
  - McIntire's.

- que:
  - Ooomph?
  ans:
  - DYKE Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.

- que:
  - How much does it cost?
  ans:
  - DYKE Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.

- que:
  - I can't.
  ans:
  - DYKE Why would I do that?

- que:
  - DYKE What?
  ans:
  - Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...

- que:
  - Re-runs?
  ans:
  - DYKE Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.

- que:
  - DYKE Excuse me?
  ans:
  - DYKE What do I MEAN! You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...

- que:
  - DYKE Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
  ans:
  - Look ...

- que:
  - DYKE EXCUSE ME?
  ans:
  - I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.

- que:
  - Why?
  ans:
  - DYKE Because you're coming home.

- que:
  - Why don't you just take me back without it?
  ans:
  - DYKE Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.

- que:
  - DYKE How long do you think you've been here?
  ans:
  - I don't know ... Three, four weeks.

- que:
  - I'm going on trial tomorrow?
  ans:
  - DYKE This is TV pal. They don't fool around.

- que:
  - Bud?
  ans:
  - Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
