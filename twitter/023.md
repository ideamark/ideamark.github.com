the envelope is fake news.

## why should he be any different than the rest of us?
gotcha, i'm always looking for crazy shit like twitter lists of "suspected pizza pedos".

## have u run across an acct that is devoted to russian trolls/bots?
i did,  they only followed trolls/bots, but forget the name..

## are we sure this isn't what happened with the election?

## faye read it, disappeared, and warren took the bullet, right?
he looked so doddering at first, too, but i guess it was just brilliant acting!

## from season 1?
did you guys see that?" emma stone just asked the press room corps.

## did she not take her envelope?
im so confused!

## did they really have to snatched it out of his hand like that?
emotions were high.

## why isn't this trending?!?
this should be retweeted until everyone in this country sees it.

## yeah i guess emma stone had her card in her hand so maybe they accidentally had two best actress envelopes?
i thought people kept theirs, so that confused me.

## this is what real life is supposed to b?
very clearly, even in my dreams this cannot be true.

## actually there was, its called moonlight have you heard of it?
we're ready.

## can you hear a voice at the end of this clip say "it says emma stone"?
lol, warren threw her under the bus by having her announce the winner when he wasn't sure..

## are you also planning on trying to buy one while you're down here?
mood in the press room must be electric..

## like, how did jungle book beat kubo?
this may be my gigantic bias toward practical effects talking..

## so how did he get the emma stone card too?
somewhere in the main offices of the oscars right now,.

## is that a random shot or the actual moment?
panic over.

## what i miss?
rt "the truth is in the other envelope.

## why the fuck won't i?
because you're not white.

## what is wrong with america?
hollyweird succumbed 2 their god, sharpton, who called 4 boycott cause black movie hadn't won yet.

## free wi-fi!?
what a world we live in....

## how do you even enforce such a thing as free wi-fi?
the news barely focused on the actual winner.

big dinner with governors tonight at white house.

troop killed by your hands..

## wathad come over yu?

something is going on.

## i thought this guys career was over?
hollywood only cares about the benjamins.

## how do you know that?
i'm kidding.

## why would there have ever been 2 cards/envelopes for best actress?
what if you wake up tomorrow the wrong person because you chose the wrong envelope in a dream..

## usa today is reporting they took best actress but maybe it was best director instead?
they have two envelopes.

## backside express this shot?
that was the final one.

## why don't they simply tell the people announcing the award who won b4 they go on stage so there is no confusion?
emma stone backstage said she had her card the whole time!

## why does every filipino home hold a piano?
because it's hard to steal and it's completely "unnecessary".

## maybe it has corrected?
happened the day before.

## plus i'm still trying to figure it out--who knew it was wrong?
i'll feel bad if they get axed for this.

## which of the current ones can be sacrificed for a new one?
i don't blame warren beatty.

## what do i plug it into?
the tv, that's what the tvs built in tuner feature are for.

## understood, could we get the rest of the order number?
they're should 3-4 more digits..

## how tf did rush hour not get an oscar?
whew moonlight snatching the award they fully deserved from blah blah land has me in the mood to dance.

## so maybe that election...?
i keep on hoping they'll prove their was collusion soon and give us a special election.

## how long have the oscars been around?
that!

## is he though?
um yes it was in the envelope.

## the envelope and card was for best actress though?
i thought affleck was very good in mbts but i didn't know why a movie needed to be made about that character..

## this confuses me tho, like what does that mean?
well it seems that there were 2 of the same cards  warren was given the duplicate.

## but by whom?
david stern and vladimir putin..

## find a solution at qb?
the might be six moves away from glory,.

## oh, so they gave the second emma envelope out?
